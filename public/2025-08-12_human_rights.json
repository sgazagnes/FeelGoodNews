      "content": "Deborah Daley 00:06\n\nHello and welcome to Changemakers, a podcast series brought to you by Nature, where we shine a light on fascinating and extraordinary scientists.\n\nI’m Deborah Daley, global Chair of Springer Nature’s Black Employee Network, and I’m very proud to present this series, where we explore exclusion in science and how some researchers are doing something about it.\n\nIn episode six, we meet a US researcher who works tirelessly to bridge the Native American worldview with Western science.\n\nJoslynn Lee 00:50\n\nYá’át’ééh.\n\nMy name is Joslynn Lee. I am of the Diné (Navajo) and Keres-speaking Laguna-Acoma people, and I’m currently an associate professor of chemistry at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado. And I am really excited to bring my Indigenous values from my cultural upbringing into chemistry and STEM courses that I teach here.\n\nSo I grew up in New Mexico. And this wasn’t too far from where my dad grew up. He grew up in Shiprock, New Mexico, and that’s one of the larger towns on Navajo Nation.\n\nMy mom grew up in a little village of Mesita, which is part of Laguna Pueblo. But growing up not fully immersed on the reservation was where I missed being able to speak my Native languages and being what we call inter-tribal. So that’s being background from multiple tribal nations or Indigenous groups.\n\nSo that also brought more lived experiences that I think differ from a lot of other Indigenous folks.\n\nBut with that, I had a different perspective from my peers who grew up in the city and may not have had connections to their traditional upbringing.\n\nMy nálí. So this is what we call your paternal grandparents on your Navajo side. She was the first person who really got me into science, and she raised goats and would herd them in her younger days.\n\nNow she’s a little bit older that it’s hard for her to get out walking, so my parents would drop us off, and we would spend time with her, and we would also go sheep herding or goat herding with her.\n\nAnd along those experiences, I got to see the vast geology, and not really knowing the scientific terms, but just making observations.\n\nAnd I think when I reflect back on that, that is a key component as a scientist. So on these walks, we would look at various plants, and she would highlight which were medicinal or which were edible.\n\nAnd I think that experience really got me captivated by how we use plants, how we take care of them, how we talk to them.\n\nAnd then I would go back to school in the border town, where we really didn’t have that training. It was more of classification. This is a plant, and that’s it. There was not really a reciprocal understanding of it.\n\nSo I think early on in my perspective as a scientist, it was more battling the two worldviews that we didn’t really talk about as a family. It was more you kept them separate.\n\nIt wasn’t until I got to college that I was taking organic chemistry, and I had a really great professor here who was interested in how I could bridge some of my cultural background into organic chemistry.\n\nSo we had a natural dyes lab. And with that, I go back to the plants that my nálí, my grandmother, shared with me, and she took me out, and I was able to gather some plants, bring them back to the lab and look at some of the colouring, but also identify some of the molecules that were used on the medicinal side, both from literature, but also using some of our spectroscopy methods.\n\nSo that was really a unique space that I got excited, on how I could bring my whole self in science. And also, you know, think about the knowledge you share.\n\nBecause I had the discussion with my professor of like, “I can’t share where this plant is from, because I don’t want other people going through and gathering it, or studying it.”\n\nAnd, you know, I wanted to return stuff that wasn’t used in lab back home, because that’s sort of what we were taught culturally.\n\nSo that was my experience of thinking about my culture being Indigenous. And then you know what ways I could identify spaces in my college career.\n\nSo Fort Lewis College is a Native American-serving non-tribal institution. Thirty per cent of our student population identifies as Indigenous, Native American, Alaska Native.\n\nSo that designation is similar to a Hispanic-serving institution or minority-serving institution. But at the school, and why I chose to work here, was because of the higher population of Indigenous students.\n\nSo currently I teach our lower division general chemistry classes and upper division biochemistry courses. That’s my teaching portion.\n\nThe research side, because I’m an assistant professor, my group, we study microbes in various environments, specifically environmental.\n\nAnd one project we have is studying the microbial makeup of acid mine drainage.\n\nSo in the beautiful mountains around Durango in the early 1900s there’s been a lot of mining. And some of those mines have been abandoned and not fully cleaned up.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the federal government here has allocated money, but there are over 400 mines, so I’m interested in what are some of those unique microbes in those extreme conditions of low pH, and how they uptake different metals.\n\nSo that’s one avenue. Another is looking at that shift in the microbial makeup at some of those extreme conditions in rivers, and then how that moves down into New Mexico.\n\nSo following the Animas river that’s in Colorado, linking up to the San Juan river in New Mexico, and that San Juan river goes through Navajo Nation.\n\nSo there have been a lot of questions on, what is the health of our rivers? So that’s one thing. I’m trying to do more of a longitudinal study to identify impacts of some of this runoff that we get when we have freeze-thaw, because we get a lot of snow in the mountains up here. And what are the cycles? What are the shifts.\n\nDo we see more metals that are released? And then what do some of those microbes do? Do they uptake some of the metals, or as their sort of bio, natural bioremediation? Or do we need to be more careful in the cleanup of this?\n\nSo when I think about my values and knowledge system in my role currently, I think about growing up, being shown the land, sort of seeing my responsibility to take care of it.\n\nSo I think that aligns into why I do the research I do. I care about our water. I care about the plants because we rely on them.\n\nAnd even though I’m not in my exact traditional homelands, you know, we’re bordering them, where I’m at in Durango, Colorado, but just knowing the river ways are connected, so everything that happens in the mountains is what’s downstream water sources for where the desert is.\n\nAnd growing up, learning about how to think about taking care of other people, was also an embedded value for me.\n\nSo as I’m thinking of my role as a faculty member, thinking about who’s in my classroom, trying to build a community of support, but also empower the students who I’m teaching to see themselves as also the same position of they want to take care of Mother Earth, Father Sky.\n\nSo they’re here to get an education, to be able to go back to their own home communities and see how they can either advocate, do research to help answer questions, and also think about sustaining their language, their cultural practices.\n\nWhen I’m thinking about, you know, not just teaching chemistry, it’s also a group of students that have the same lived experience that I do.\n\nThat we all have this goal that it’s not…we’re just here to learn chemistry, to get a job, it’s much bigger than that.\n\nAnd trying to get other faculty to be aware of this. That these students, you know, may not came come from the best educational system, but they really want to have those final goals to help their families.\n\nThere are ways that I think about my learning, so I do a lot of storytelling or, like, talk about experiments on how people get to finding out knowledge, because that’s how I was raised, on how we know about spaces within our tribal communities and how we use land.\n\nBecause when I think about my Keres side, we don’t write down, it’s an oral tradition that’s passed. So you have to speak the language, practice ceremonies. And not growing up there. I don’t have all of the full understanding. On my Navajo side. You know, there is a written language.\n\nWe think about the Navajo code talkers also, so it’s been written down. But there are also oral stories that help us learn about concepts think about our ways of life.\n\nSo for me, when I’m thinking about instructing in the classroom, a lot of students who don’t come from that sort of upbringing don’t like the style as much of hearing about more of a story and coming back around to it.\n\nThat’s one thing I’ve seen in some of my student evaluation, is that I’m very long-winded in some areas, but we still do some hands on-activities, but it takes me maybe two to three lectures for them to finally get to like, \"Oh, we follow this full circle that you’re coming back to for a concept.\"\n\nAnd then another main worldview, it’s called hózhó. And this is for Navajo, that we try to see a balance in how we live our lives, and that’s sort of like our level we want to get to.\n\nSo as you’re progressing from a child to an elder, you have different lived experiences.\n\nBut the ultimate goal is to make sure you’re taking care of yourself, but your people around you, and also Mother Earth, and every decision that you make will get you to that direction.\n\nSo when we talk about our tribal elders, they’re the ones who have the knowledge, the experience, and they are trying to attain that level of their livelihood.\n\nAnd when I think about how I also rely on their knowledge, on not just my education, but just how you are as a human being.\n\nSo that’s one thing I think a lot of students would want more elders on campus, but we haven’t really figured out the best way that we could help that connection.\n\nSo there are different things I think I can do in the classroom, in research, and then having access for students to see that you can have your Indigenous values when you’re in academia.\n\nWhen we think about our traditional stories, a lot of these we see as gifts. And they’re also like beings.\n\nSo there’s a respect for, like, a plant. It’s not just like a plant to us. This is another living entity that, you know, we see in a different manner than people.\n\nSo whenever we have students who have to dissect or go and collect samples for class, like, it’s really tricky for them because a lot of them see them as, like, beings that, in our culture, we respect at a different level. And we have to make an offering.\n\nBut if you’re in a classroom, you’re going out collecting stuff, and you have to just, like, pick something up, but that’s not usually the manner you approach a plan. It can be very uneasy for a lot of students.\n\nSo we’ve talked about within our school, how do we balance that field collecting or even dissecting? Because some of the animals that we see in our Indigenous practices are protectors, and we shouldn’t harm them.\n\nOthers may have a taboo or bad perspective that we aren’t supposed to engage with them. So that’s another thing of like, how do you build an inclusive class that is mindful of cultural practices but provide some of the knowledge that you can gain from it.\n\nSo yeah, so microbes are an area I got into because I didn’t have to figure out how do I prepare students working with a cell line or something that comes from a human?\n\nBecause for us Navajo folks, we’re not supposed to touch things from another human or interact with it, because we don’t know what happened to that individual.\n\nSo working with human cells is really tricky. I think for a lot of indigenous folks. Some people may not be that traditional, so they don’t practice it. So that’s another nuance that we see.\n\nWe can’t assume everybody who’s Indigenous doesn’t have this. But how do we create that space to talk about it is one thing I’ve been learning being a faculty member.\n\nWhen we think about the word diversity, when I think about it in the context of science, it’s really the idea that you have different viewpoints.\n\nSo when I think about research questions that I’ve encountered in my graduate training, postdoc training, I don’t just focus on one thing. I see the interconnectedness and other areas we have to consider.\n\nMy Indigenous perspective is all the actions we have are going to have effects on other things.\n\nSo if we extract something from Mother Earth, in our perspective, we go back and either return it, or fix or update or modify to get it back to the most original state to avoid any repercussions happening.\n\nSo that’s one thing I always think about whenever I’m out in the field, is to have less impact. But when we’re looking at research questions in the lab, is just we can’t look at one thing on its own.\n\nWe can start with that, but you have to think about the interconnectedness to other entities within the cell if you’re looking at it.\n\nAs students have that reminder of just like, “Oh, even though we’re focusing on maybe one molecule, there is some connectedness to other organisms that we see.”\n\nSo we talk about antibiotics, like those come from bacteria. So it’s, I think, really cool to have that more worldview or whole perspective that can encourage people to think outside of the box or have more creativity.\n\nSo when I think about the idea of diversity in science and why it’s so crucial and different worldviews, it’s mostly that sort of reminder that not everyone is going to approach science in one way.\n\nDeborah Daley 18:33\n\nIn the next episode, we meet a Mexican American research leader who has turned mentoring into an evidence-based science.",

      "summary": "Twenty-two Angika speakers and five language guardians joined a workshop in Bhagalpur, Bihar, India from April 28–29, 2025, to explore digital strategies for enhancing Angika’s online presence, organized by Rising Voices and Angika Wikimedians.",
      "content": "The online presence of a language is vital for promoting its usage in everyday life. This is something well understood by speakers of Angika, a language spoken in the Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nFollowing a call for participation by Angika Wikimedians and Rising Voices, Angika language speakers and supporters gathered in Bhagalpur, India, on April 28–29, 2025, to explore digital strategies for strengthening Angika's presence online. Guided by eight key strategies — facilitate, multiply, normalize, educate, reclaim, imagine, defend, and protect — Angika speaking participants learned about community-centered approaches to support and revitalize their language in the digital sphere.\n\nCreating a roadmap for digitizing Angika\n\nThe two-day workshop in Bhagalpur ran from 10 am to 4 pm each day. The event attracted significant interest, from which 22 participants were selected. In addition to the participants, five language guardians, including veteran Angika writers, were present throughout both days of the workshop.\n\nDay one began with participants introducing themselves. They discussed their connection to the Angika language and identity, and shared their motivations for supporting Angika. They also stressed the importance of speaking one’s language as a means of strengthening community bonds.\n\nAn interactive session on language rights followed, which prompted a range of responses from attendees. Participants ruminated over the decline of Angika as a preferred language for public communication, the lack of educational resources in Angika, and their desire to spearhead a shift in social attitudes by increasing the language's online visibility.\n\nPreceded by an announcement on group expectations, the second half of the day featured an introduction to the UNESCO and Rising Voices toolkit, Digital Initiatives for Indigenous Languages, and its strategies, presented by trainer Amrit Sufi.\n\nDay two continued with further training, followed by a roadmap creation activity for each participant. The purpose of this exercise was to help participants visualize the needs of Angika within their specific areas of interest and prepare a pathway for the creation of a solution.\n\nEach participant had unique aspirations for the language — some emphasized the role of music in preserving the language’s culture, others aimed to build apps, while some focused on creating illustrated books for children or language-learning apps. Several others also proposed contributing to Wikimedia projects as a way to support Angika digitally by creating content. Kumar Gaurav, the workshop coordinator contributed significantly to furthering the discussion on next steps.\n\nFollow-up activities\n\nFollowing the April 2025 workshop, several participants expressed interest in pursuing Angika Wikipedia as a method to enhance the language’s online visibility. Due to the overwhelming amount of interest, organizers arranged for a follow-up online workshop on July 17, 2025, facilitated by Nitesh Gill from Open Knowledge Initiatives. Enthusiastic participants joined to learn about different Wikimedia projects, editing Wikipedia articles, and using reliable references. New editors also discussed challenges related to account creation, blocks, and technical difficulties.\n\nThe online workshop session began with an intro to Wikipedia, followed by training in both visual and text editing, and concluded with a Q&A session. The next workshop in the series will focus on improving the quality and depth of Wikipedia articles. The goal is to continue these workshops to empower the Angika-speaking community and help them become self-sufficient contributors to digital knowledge platforms.\n\nThe April 2025 Rising Voices workshop was well-timed to meet the needs of the Angika community, which is striving to represent itself independently and collaborate in asserting its linguistic and cultural identity.",

      "content": "British man who perished in Antarctic glacier found 65 years later\n\n19 hours ago Share Save Georgina Rannard Climate and science correspondent Share Save\n\nDavid Bell Dennis Bell was on a two-year assignment in Antarctica\n\nThe bones of a British man who died in a terrible accident in Antarctica in 1959 have been discovered in a melting glacier. The remains were found in January by a Polish Antarctic expedition, alongside a wristwatch, a radio, and a pipe. He has now been formally identified as Dennis \"Tink\" Bell, who fell into a crevasse aged 25 when working for the organisation that became the British Antarctic Survey. \"I had long given up on finding my brother. It is just remarkable, astonishing. I can't get over it,\" David Bell, 86, tells BBC News.\n\nBritish Antarctic Survey Dennis Bell in 1959 at the Admiralty Bay station - he was known for his love of the husky dogs\n\n\"Dennis was one of the many brave personnel who contributed to the early science and exploration of Antarctica under extraordinarily harsh conditions,\" says Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey . \"Even though he was lost in 1959, his memory lived on among colleagues and in the legacy of polar research,\" she adds.\n\nDariusz Puczko The bones were found on the moraine and surface of the Ecology Glacier, on western shore of Admiralty Bay\n\nIt was David who answered the door in his family home in Harrow, London, in July 1959. \"The telegram boy said, 'I'm sorry to tell you, but this is bad news',\" he says. He went upstairs to tell his parents. \"It was a horrendous moment,\" he adds. Talking to me from his home in Australia and sitting next to his wife Yvonne, David smiles as stories from his childhood in 1940s England spill out. They are the memories of a younger sibling admiring a charming, adventurous big brother. \"Dennis was fantastic company. He was very amusing. The life and soul of wherever he happened to be,\" David says.\n\nDavid Bell, 86, spoke to BBC News from his home in Australia\n\n\"I still can't get over this, but one evening when me, my mother and father came home from the cinema,\" he says. \"And I have to say this in fairness to Dennis, he had put a newspaper down on the kitchen table, but on top of it, he'd taken a motorbike engine apart and it was all over the table,\" he says. \"I can remember his style of dress, he always used to wear duffel coats. He was just an average sort of fellow who enjoyed life,\" he adds.\n\nD. Bell Dennis Bell is on the far right of the picture, celebrating Christmas in Antarctica in 1958 - seven months before he died\n\nDennis Bell, nickednamed \"Tink\", was born in 1934. He worked with the RAF and trained as a meteorologist, before joining the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey to work in Antarctica. \"He was obsessed with Scott's diaries,\" David says, referring to Captain Robert Scott who was one of the first men to reach the South Pole and died on an expedition in 1912. Dennis went to Antarctica in 1958. He was stationed for a two-year assignment at Admiralty Bay, a small UK base with about 12 men on King George Island, which is roughly 120 kilometres (75 miles) off the northern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nRussell Thompson Men at the base on King George Island relied on sledges and dogs to get around the harsh terrain\n\nThe British Antarctic Survey keeps meticulous records and its archivist Ieuan Hopkins has dug out detailed base camp reports about Dennis's work and antics on the harsh and \"ridiculously isolated\" island. Reading aloud, Mr Hopkins says: \"He's cheerful and industrious, with a mischievous sense of humour and fondness for practical jokes.\"\n\nRussell Thompson Dennis Bell (on the left) was known for his sense of humour - he is re-enacting an advert on the snow in this picture\n\nDennis's job was to send up meteorological weather balloons and radio the reports to the UK every three hours, which involved firing up a generator in sub-zero conditions. Described as the best cook in the hut, he was in charge of the food store over the winter when no supplies could reach them. Antarctica felt even more cut off than it is today, with extremely limited contact with home. David recalls recording a Christmas message at BBC studios with his parents and sister Valerie to be sent to his brother. He was best known for his love of the husky dogs used to pull sledges around the island, and he raised two litters of dogs.\n\nBritish Antarctic Survey Dennis Bell, on the left, with dogs at the Admiralty Bay Station in 1959\n\nHe was also involved in surveying King George Island to produce some of the first mapping of the largely unexplored place. It was on a surveying trip that the accident happened, a few weeks after his 25th birthday. On 26 July 1959, in the deep Antarctic winter, Dennis and a man called Jeff Stokes left the base to climb and survey a glacier. Accounts in the British Antarctic Survey records explain what happened next and the desperate attempts to rescue him. The snow was deep and the dogs had started to show signs of tiredness. Dennis went on ahead alone to encourage them, but he wasn't wearing his skis. Suddenly he disappeared into a crevasse, leaving a hole behind him.\n\nAccording to the accounts, Jeff Stokes called into the depths and Dennis was able to shout back. He grabbed onto a rope that was lowered down. The dogs pulled on the rope and Dennis was hitched up to the lip of the hole. But he had tied the rope onto his belt, perhaps because of the angle he lay in. As he reached the lip, the belt broke and he fell again. His friend called again, but this time Dennis didn't reply. \"That's a story I shall never get over,\" says David.\n\nThe base camp reports about the accident are business-like. \"We heard from Jeff […] that yesterday Tink fell down a crevasse and was killed. We hope to return tomorrow, sea ice permitting,\" it continues. Mr Hopkins explains that another man, called Alan Sharman, had died weeks earlier, and the morale was very low. \"The sledge has got back. We heard the sad details. Jeff has badly bitten frostbitten hands. We are not taking any more risks to recover,\" the report reads the day after the accident. Reading the reports again, Mr Hopkins discovered that earlier in the season, it had been Dennis who'd made the coffin for Alan Sharman.\n\nRussell Thompson Dennis Bell (left) and Jeff Stokes (right) photographed before the accident. Jeff Stokes died five weeks ago before hearing the news that Dennis's remains had been found.\n\n\"My mother never really got over it. She couldn't handle photographs of him and couldn't talk about him,\" David says. He recalls that two men on Dennis's base visited the family, bringing a sheepskin as a gesture. \"But there was no conclusion. There was no service; there was no anything. Just Dennis gone,\" David says.\n\nBritish Antarctic Survey Dennis Bell died near Point Thomas in Admiralty Bay\n\nAbout 15 years ago, David was contacted by Rod Rhys Jones, chair of the British Antarctic Monument Trust. Since 1944, 29 people have died working on British Antarctic Territory on scientific missions, according to the trust. Rod was organising a voyage for relatives of some of the 29 to see the spectacular and remote place where their loved ones had lived and died. David joined the expedition, called South 2015. \"The captain stopped at the locations and give four or five hoots of the siren,\" he says. The sea-ice was too thick for David to reach his brother's hut on King George Island. \"But it was very, very moving. It lifted the pressure, a weight off my head, as it were,\" he says. It gave him a sense of closure. \"And I thought that would be it,\" he says.\n\nDariusz Puczko Scientists found Dennis's remains by the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station\n\nBut on 29 January this year, a team of Polish researchers working from the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station stumbled across something practically on their doorstep. Dennis had been found. Some bones were in the loose ice and rocks deposited at the foot of Ecology Glacier on King George Island. Others were found on the glacier surface. The scientists explain that fresh snowfall was imminent, and they put down a GPS marker so their \"fellow polar colleague\" would not be lost again.\n\nDariusz Puczko Researchers at the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station carefully recorded the remains\n\nA team of scientists made up of Piotr Kittel, Paulina Borówka and Artur Ginter at University of Lodz, Dariusz Puczko at the Polish Academy of Sciences and fellow researcher Artur Adamek carefully rescued the remains in four trips. It is a dangerous and unstable place, \"criss-crossed with crevasses\", and with slopes of up to 45 degrees, according to the Polish team. Climate change is causing dramatic changes to many Antarctic glaciers, including Ecology Glacier, which is undergoing intense melting.\n\n\"The place where Dennis was found is not the same as the place where he went missing,\" the team explains. \"Glaciers, under the influence of gravity, move their mass of ice, and with it, Dennis made his journey,\" they say. Fragments of bamboo ski poles, remains of an oil lamp, glass containers for cosmetics, and fragments from military tents were also collected. \"Every effort was made to ensure that Dennis could return home,\" the team say. \"It's an opportunity to reassess the contribution these men made, and an opportunity to promote science and what we've done in the Antarctic over many decades,\" adds Rod Rhys Jones.\n\nDariusz Puczko Many of Antarctica's glaciers are receding leaving behind rocky material and exposing material trapped inside",
