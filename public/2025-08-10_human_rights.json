      "title": "Dancing for Peace: How schools are uniting Nigeria through culture",
      "summary": "\"Our students come from different tribes and religions. Cultural activities help them see beyond those differences and appreciate each other’s traditions.\"",
      "content": "Across Nigeria, from the bustling streets of Lagos in the South West to the quiet communities of Taraba State in the North East, schools are finding creative ways to plant the seeds of peace and unity among their students. Their method? Culture.\n\nAt the heart of this transformation is the idea that music, dance, and cultural appreciation can do more than entertain: They can unite.\n\n“One of our main objectives is peace-building,” Nuradeen Bello, Director of the Womanhood School of Health Sciences in Kaduna, Northwest Nigeria, told Peace News Network (PNN).\n\nOur students come from different tribes and religions. Cultural activities help them see beyond those differences and appreciate each other’s traditions.\n\nAt his institution, students from diverse backgrounds, including Christians, Muslims, Gbagis, Hausas, Igbos, Yorubas, Nupes, Kanuris, and Ebiras, come together to showcase traditional foods, costumes, and ceremonies. Bello believes this exposure builds a deep-rooted respect that textbooks alone can’t provide. He added:\n\nSome of our students had never even heard the Ebira language before. After participating in our events, they not only heard it, they celebrated it. When there’s unity, peace follows naturally.\n\nBello emphasized that cultural education starts early at his school. He added that by the time students graduate, they have participated in at least two or three cultural events. Bello said the impact is lasting, teaching students tolerance and preparing them for peaceful living wherever they go.\n\nHe suggested that if other schools embraced such an approach, it could promote unity and tolerance in Nigeria. He said:\n\nAll schools should aim to harmonize their activities to include everyone. Every student should be recognized and given a sense of belonging.\n\nHe stressed that this would bring harmony and unity in schools, helping peace naturally thrive.\n\nCulture as a bridge in the South\n\nIn Lagos, Obialunamma Chidindu, a schoolteacher at Moral Esteem School in Abijo, Ibeju-Lekki, has seen how powerful cultural showcases can be — especially during events attended by parents from across Nigeria. She noted:\n\nCultural dance presentations help foster unity. When Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo dances are performed together, it creates an atmosphere of shared appreciation.\n\nChidindu admitted she shared the Igbo dance from a recent school event on her social media because she choreographed it. But she made clear:\n\nIt wasn’t just the Igbo culture represented. We had Hausa and Yoruba too. Everyone was celebrated, and all the parents, regardless of tribe, appreciated the diversity.\n\nShe believes every school can find its rhythm when it comes to promoting culture, even if not during major events like graduation. Chidindu noted that some schools observe Cultural Day on Democracy Day or other national holidays. “What matters is the intention — bringing people together through shared experience,” she said.\n\nOn the impact on their students, she added that the dances were not just entertainment, but helped them appreciate one another regardless of tribal differences. “You can see that spirit of unity being cultivated through such events,” she said.\n\nOne of the major challenges facing the cultural programs is preference given to a particular tribe or tribes during an event, which Chidindu feels might trigger reactions from other tribes in the school.\n\nAccording to her, the organizers must avoid limiting such a cultural show to a particular tribe, as other groups should also be represented. “People might start thinking, ‘Oh, this tribe is more important, that’s why they’re being showcased,’” she said. To address such a challenge, she advised having performances from at least three different tribes in the school.\n\nUnity dances and young minds in Abuja\n\nMohammed Lawal Abubakar, head of the Cultural and Creative Club at LEA Primary School, Zuba in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, organizes a yearly “Unity Dance” that brings together students from various ethnic groups in the capital. Abubakar shared:\n\nThe children are always excited. They learn dances from other tribes and wear traditional outfits. It makes them feel seen and included.\n\nHe added that such cultural events in schools promote national development and peaceful coexistence by encouraging unity among citizens, especially when children are introduced to it early.\n\nNigeria is a country with many ethnic groups, especially in the North. If children are taught to appreciate each other’s cultures, they will grow up respecting one another.\n\nHe emphasized that the aim is to teach children mutual understanding to help foster peaceful coexistence, urging other schools to adopt such good practices to show their pupils that this will help promote peace in their communities.\n\nFor him, the dances aren't just about fun, they're about building national identity. Abubakar explained:\n\nThese events help children understand one another and develop empathy early. This is where peace starts on the playground, not just at peace summits.\n\nHe said the positive response has been overwhelming. He noted that when he introduced the idea to his school, everyone embraced it.\n\nThe children look forward to it, and as teachers, we are happy about it because it undeniably builds mutual understanding, which contributes to peace in the country.\n\nStrengthening identity in the Northeast\n\nIn Taraba State, Suleiman Muhammad Adamu, director of Albayan School, echoed the same sentiment. He noted:\n\nWe organize cultural celebrations so that students can understand and appreciate their traditions and those of their peers.\n\nFor Adamu, it’s not just about showing off tribal dances; It’s about shaping identity and fostering pride. He said:\n\nMany children have little exposure to cultures outside their own. These events deepen their understanding and spark curiosity about others.\n\nThe bigger picture: Peace beyond the classroom\n\nPrince Charles Dickson, team lead at Tattaaunawa Roundtable Initiative (TRICentre) in Jos, sees the ripple effect. As someone committed to dialogue and nonviolent approaches to conflict, he believes cultural expressions like dance are powerful instruments for healing, education, and bridge-building, especially among young people.\n\nHe described the idea of using cultural dance in schools as a tool for peacebuilding in Nigeria as both timely and deeply significant. He explained:\n\nDance, rooted in local heritage and identity becomes more than performance, it becomes shared memory, emotional release, and communal affirmation.\n\nHe added:\n\nWhen embedded into school curricula or extracurricular activities, it not only celebrates diversity but also teaches tolerance, empathy, and coexistence in a way that is non-threatening and joyful.\n\nIn a country as diverse as Nigeria, where tribal and religious tensions have long caused friction, these stories from classrooms across the country serve as a quiet revolution. They prove that peacebuilding can start with a song, a step, and a shared plate of traditional food.\n\nAs Bello put it, “We are not just teaching our students to pass exams, we are teaching them to live together.”",

Ali Akbar has been pounding the pavement of Paris's Left Bank for more than 50 years, papers under the arm and on his lips the latest headline. And now he is to be officially recognised for his contribution to French culture. President Emmanuel Macron – who once as a student himself bought newspapers from Mr Akbar – is to decorate him next month with the Order of Merit, one of France's highest honours. \"When I began here in 1973 there were 35 or 40 of us hawkers in Paris,\" he says. \"Now I am alone. \"It became too discouraging. Everything is digital now. People just want to consult their telephones.\" These days, on his rounds via the cafés of fashionable Saint-Germain, Mr Akbar can hope to sell around 30 copies of Le Monde. He keeps half the sale price, but gets no refund for returns. Back before the Internet, he would sell 80 copies within the first hour of the newspaper's afternoon publication. \"In the old days people would crowd around me looking for the paper. Now I have to chase down clients to try to sell one,\" he says.\n\nReuters Mr Akbar (right) now sells far fewer papers than he did in the days before the internet\n\nNot that the decline in trade remotely bothers Mr Akbar, who says he keeps going for the sheer joy of the job. \"I am a joyous person. And I am free. With this job, I am completely independent. There is no-one giving me orders. That's why I do it.\" The sprightly 72-year-old is a familiar and much-loved figure in the neighbourhood. \"I first came here in the 1960s and I've grown up with Ali. He is like a brother,\" says one woman. \"He knows everyone. And he is such fun,\" says another. Ali Akbar was born in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and made his way to Europe in the late 1960s, arriving first in Amsterdam where he got work on board a cruise liner. In 1972 the ship docked in the French city of Rouen, and a year later he was in Paris. He got his residency papers in the 1980s.\n\nReuters The 72-year-old is well-known and well-loved in the neighbourhood",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 08 August 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-02516-8Indigenous scholars set out eight steps to stop marginalization in academia and to enable a shared Indigenous agenda in science.",
      "content": "Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives intend to support Black, Indigenous and other marginalized scholars — but the pace of change has remained slow.\n\nToo often, Indigenous people continue to be objects of research; they must be allowed to become research leaders. For this to happen, extractive research that is taken from Indigenous people without their meaningful involvement, benefit or consent must stop. Indigenous communities must be in charge of whether or not they participate in research, and what happens with any data collected. This is how universities and scientific institutions should uphold key principles of Indigenous self-determination, and ensure data sovereignty in education and research. Institutional power and expertise must serve Indigenous causes, too, and the research community must nurture Indigenous scholars.\n\nWe are Indigenous scientists who work and live in the settler-colonial countries of Aotearoa (New Zealand), Canada, Australia and the United States, with expertise spanning microbiology, astrophysics, behavioural ecology, hydrogeology, water science, Traditional Knowledge, Indigenous Research Methodologies and Indigenous geographies. Here, we outline eight steps that academic institutions can take to stop marginalizing Indigenous people.\n\nRecognize science’s colonial legacy\n\nDominant science (sometimes referred to as Western science) is rooted in colonization, racism and white supremacy: it has been an active participant in the assimilation, marginalization and genocide of Indigenous people1,2. Black and Indigenous people have been exploited repeatedly by dominant science for monetary and educational gain3, and many institutions were funded by money acquired after stealing Indigenous lands.\n\nIndigenous youth must be at the forefront of climate diplomacy\n\nCaptain James Cook’s voyage to the South Pacific in 1768, for example, wasn’t only a scientific expedition commissioned by the UK Royal Society — it was also meant to help colonize New Zealand and Australia for the UK government. On arrival in Aotearoa, Cook shot and killed at least nine Māori1. Yet he and his crew are widely remembered as scientists, explorers and cartographers. The accomplishments of scientists, past and present, are often celebrated — including through the names of parks, species, buildings, awards and fellowships — without acknowledgment of the harm they perpetuated.\n\nThese concerns are not simply a historical artefact. Colonialism remains deeply embedded in many facets of dominant science, leading to inequitable health and social outcomes. For example, Indigenous people globally have lower life expectancies and higher rates of maternal and infant mortalities than other population groups. And facial-recognition algorithms are often based on white facial features, meaning their results have high false-positive rates for Black and Indigenous people.\n\nThese practices (past and present) have caused harm and a distrust of scientific research in Indigenous communities. To begin to dismantle these legacies, all scientists must understand how their disciplines have enabled colonialism. Universities must ensure that students learn the history of their field as part of the curriculum. For example, at Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, the bachelor of science degree includes a mandatory course about the relationship between science and Indigenous knowledges (both Māori and Pacific) in Aotearoa.\n\nFund Indigenous scientists\n\nIndigenous scientists are chronically underfunded internationally: they often receive fewer academic fellowships and research grants than their white colleagues do4. For example, in the United States, between 1996 and 2019, white principal investigators were consistently funded by the National Science Foundation at higher rates than were principal investigators of colour4. In 2021, Māori were under-represented in both decision-making panels and in successful applications for the Endeavour Fund5 — one of New Zealand’s largest research funds, named after Cook’s ship. This under-representation, combined with the fact that Indigenous people occupy few research positions (statistics from settler-colonial countries such as Australia suggest that less than 1% of all PhD holders globally are Indigenous) means that these scientists are often locked out of opportunities to do meaningful research6.\n\nThis lack of access is not limited to research funding and has numerous knock-on effects. The key metric of research success used by most funding mechanisms is narrow: the number of papers published in high-impact journals. But these papers are often behind paywalls or, when open-access options are available, prohibitively expensive for scholars who do not have institutional revenues. And Indigenous science scholarship often gets relegated to review-type or opinion pieces rather than primary research papers. Many Indigenous scholars also conduct, and want to publish, research in the language of the community involved, which can be at odds with the dominance of English in high-impact journals.\n\nTraditional land owners start a controlled fire of bushland in Australia’s Northern Territory.Credit: Matthew Abbott/Panos Pictures\n\nIndigenous faculty members add other strengths to research communities: outreach, education and mentoring in both Indigenous and campus communities, for example. But those activities require time away from writing papers and grant proposals, and are typically not valued and rewarded by funding mechanisms.\n\nThus, university leaders and funders should implement the following changes. First, create flexible funds specifically for Indigenous scientists, to be used for fostering relationships with Indigenous communities. Second, fund research led by Indigenous scholars. Too often, projects about Indigenous Knowledge are conducted by people who are not from Indigenous groups or who engage with Indigenous people tokenistically. Researchers frequently ask Indigenous scientists to join their projects at a late stage, for example, rather than involving them as a collaborator from the start. Third, fund projects that are responsive to Indigenous community needs — transdisciplinary, holistic and place-based.\n\nFor these changes to happen, the conventional metrics of research excellence must be expanded. Reports written for Indigenous communities should be considered equivalent to peer-reviewed manuscripts. The scientific community must acknowledge the value of research that is led by Indigenous communities, as well as research that centres Indigenous Knowledge systems.\n\nIncreasing Indigenous representation on decision-making panels would help to break the cycle of inequity in all these areas.\n\nHire, retain, promote\n\nIn the past decade, we have noticed an increase in academic positions targeted towards Indigenous peoples, particularly in settler-colonial states that have made appreciable moves towards reconciliation, such as Australia, Aotearoa and Canada. But it is not enough to simply hire Indigenous scholars. Institutions must work to ensure that they can thrive in academia.\n\nIt is crucial to bring Indigenous scholars together, such as through mentoring networks, and to ensure that Indigenous faculty members have time to build relationships with local Indigenous Peoples.\n\nIndigenous knowledge is key to sustainable food systems\n\nUniversities have started to turn to cluster hiring, in which several people are recruited at the same time to improve racial or gender diversity. For Indigenous scholars, this approach can prevent the isolation both of the individual who is hired and of the Indigenous values, contributions and ways of knowing. Although hiring in cohorts is not sufficient by itself to change organizational culture or shift power, it is crucial to help build a critical mass of Indigenous scientists who will enable enduring change.\n\nIncreasing the presence of Indigenous researchers in a university benefits Indigenous students, who gain from being taught, mentored and supervised by Indigenous scientists in a variety of fields. We speak from personal experience — we have all had key Indigenous mentors who supported us in academic structures. It is also advantageous for students who are not from Indigenous groups to be exposed to other ways of knowing. And by showing that they value Indigenous researchers, universities can lessen perceived hierarchies in academia and in wider society.\n\nDismantle institutional racism\n\nInstitutional factors such as racism, burnout, isolation, excess labour and inequitable funding, as well as unsafe and unwelcoming environments, all contribute to greater turnover of Black and Indigenous faculty members than of white colleagues7,8. Universities must work to dismantle the structures, practices, policies and processes that have led to this situation. They must facilitate connections, collaborations and mentorships among Indigenous academics.\n\nUniversity ethics boards are not ready for Indigenous scholars\n\nEvaluation and promotion processes should be redesigned9 in consultation with key Indigenous people on and off campus. This consultation should not force Indigenous community members to make hasty decisions, but instead take into account the lived experiences of Indigenous academics as well as the community members they work with. Individual Indigenous scientists, who already have limited resources and energy, must be supported adequately — the onus should not be on them to fix the system. Any time and energy spent educating students and faculty members about Indigenous Peoples and their rights must be valued and recognized, for example in promotion processes.\n\nScientists must also attend to their own racism. It is not enough to be non-racist. Structural issues and inequities exist in the Western academy. Those who avoid engaging with racism and colonialism in scientific works and spaces merely promote the status quo. All scientists will encounter opportunities to be anti-racist. They can redress historical injustices as they work, such as by changing approaches to working in or around Indigenous land, fostering an inclusive laboratory environment, exposing students to Indigenous research methodologies and enabling citation justice, which recognizes and elevates the contributions of Indigenous scholars, knowledges and communities. Fighting racism in science is everyone’s responsibility.\n\nRecognize Indigenous Knowledge\n\nFor thousands of years, Indigenous Peoples have accumulated and developed place-based knowledge about our local environments, through systems built on each community’s philosophies, methodologies, criteria and world view. Indigenous Knowledge is increasingly being sought in both basic and applied sciences10, particularly in fields such as fire management, sustainability and conservation. But the superficial inclusion of some fragments of Indigenous Knowledge in science is not decolonization.\n\nRepresentatives of the Ngāi Tahu ki Murihiku in Aotearoa release takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri) as part of a collaborative conservation programme.Credit: Robin Hammond/Panos Pictures\n\nIt is crucial that scientists do not extract Indigenous Knowledge systems from local contexts, but instead engage with the Indigenous communities who steward such knowledge, with their full consent. White scholars must recognize, read and cite Indigenous scholarship. But they must also engage with it in deep, relational ways and be open to fully understanding its messages, even if it makes them uncomfortable — especially, we argue, if it makes them uncomfortable. Similarly, universities must stop treating Indigenous Knowledge as supplementary to ‘real knowledge’11; this perpetuates white supremacy in science.\n\nExciting but potentially difficult shifts are under way in science, policy and education. For example, in 2022, the US government released new Indigenous Knowledge guidance and an implementation memorandum for federal agencies to recognize and include Indigenous Knowledge in research, policy and decision making.",

Indigenous peoples often remain research subjects rather than leaders, affected by extractive practices that ignore their consent and benefit.\n\n**What happened** – A group of Indigenous scientists from New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and the United States published eight concrete steps for universities and research institutions to stop marginalizing Indigenous people. They call for recognizing science’s colonial roots, funding Indigenous-led research, improving hiring and retention of Indigenous scholars, and dismantling institutional racism.\n\n**Impact** – This approach goes beyond mere diversity efforts by emphasizing Indigenous self-determination, data sovereignty, and respect for Indigenous Knowledge. For example, they highlight how Indigenous scientists are underfunded and often excluded from decision-making, and how current research metrics undervalue Indigenous contributions. Their work promotes structural change to ensure Indigenous scholars can lead research that benefits their communities.\n\n**What's next step** – Institutions are encouraged to implement these steps by creating flexible funding for Indigenous research, expanding definitions of research excellence, increasing Indigenous representation on panels, and redesigning promotion processes with Indigenous input. These changes aim to build a supportive environment where Indigenous scholars thrive and their knowledge shapes science.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Indigenous scientists propose clear actions to transform academia by centering Indigenous leadership, knowledge, and equity in research and education.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les institutions scientifiques ont du mal à soutenir rapidement les chercheurs noirs, autochtones et marginalisés. Les peuples autochtones restent souvent sujets de recherche plutôt que leaders, subissant des pratiques extractives sans consentement ni bénéfices.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Un groupe de chercheurs autochtones de Nouvelle-Zélande, Canada, Australie et États-Unis a publié huit mesures concrètes pour que les universités cessent de marginaliser les peuples autochtones. Ils demandent de reconnaître l’héritage colonial de la science, de financer la recherche dirigée par les autochtones, d’améliorer le recrutement et la rétention, et de démanteler le racisme institutionnel.\n\n**Impact** – Cette démarche dépasse la simple diversité en soulignant l’autodétermination autochtone, la souveraineté des données et le respect des savoirs autochtones. Par exemple, ils montrent que les scientifiques autochtones sont sous-financés et exclus des décisions, et que les critères actuels de recherche ne valorisent pas leurs contributions. Leur travail promeut un changement structurel pour que les chercheurs autochtones dirigent des recherches bénéfiques à leurs communautés.\n\n**Étape suivante** – Les institutions sont invitées à appliquer ces mesures en créant des financements flexibles, en élargissant les critères d’excellence, en augmentant la représentation autochtone dans les comités et en repensant les promotions avec l’avis des autochtones. L’objectif est un environnement favorable où les chercheurs autochtones prospèrent et influencent la science.\n\n**En une phrase** – Des scientifiques autochtones proposent des actions claires pour transformer le monde universitaire en plaçant le leadership, les savoirs et l’équité autochtones au cœur de la recherche et de l’éducation.",

Los pueblos indígenas suelen ser sujetos de investigación, no líderes, enfrentando prácticas extractivas sin su consentimiento ni beneficio.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Un grupo de científicos indígenas de Nueva Zelanda, Canadá, Australia y Estados Unidos publicó ocho pasos concretos para que universidades e instituciones detengan la marginación indígena. Piden reconocer las raíces coloniales de la ciencia, financiar investigaciones lideradas por indígenas, mejorar la contratación y retención, y eliminar el racismo institucional.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta propuesta va más allá de la diversidad al enfatizar la autodeterminación indígena, la soberanía de datos y el respeto al conocimiento indígena. Por ejemplo, señalan que los científicos indígenas reciben menos fondos y tienen poca representación en decisiones, y que las métricas actuales subvaloran sus aportes. Su trabajo impulsa un cambio estructural para que científicos indígenas lideren investigaciones que beneficien a sus comunidades.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Se anima a las instituciones a implementar estas medidas creando fondos flexibles, ampliando los criterios de excelencia, aumentando la representación indígena en comités y rediseñando procesos de promoción con consulta indígena. Esto busca un entorno donde los científicos indígenas prosperen y su conocimiento influya en la ciencia.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Científicos indígenas proponen acciones claras para transformar la academia centrando el liderazgo, conocimiento y equidad indígena en la investigación y educación.",

      "summary": "Climate change has worsened monsoon flooding in Bangladesh, putting women of child-bearing age at risk – but the UN reproductive health agency (UNFPA) is helping them prepare. ",
      "content": "Sunamganj is a district in the wetland ecosystem in northeast Bangladesh, which is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Floods arrive quickly and suddenly and can last for weeks. They disrupt life, displace families and cut off access to services.\n\nFor the over 670,000 women of reproductive age living in the area, increasingly extreme weather events are threatening their access to reproductive healthcare.\n\nPreparation and planning\n\nTo help prepare for these crises, UNFPA is training reproductive-aged women to protect themselves and their children during the next flood.\n\nShakila Akhter, a 24-year-old mother of two, was eight months pregnant during the last flood.\n\n“Thanks to the training I received, I knew what to carry, how to prepare and how to protect my family,” she recalled. She now uses family planning tools she didn’t know about before: “I want to choose when I’m ready for another child.”\n\nShe also underscored the link between climate change and these severe floods: “We understand that the climate has changed over the past 20 years. In Bangladesh, the flood season has become longer, sudden floods are more frequent, heatwaves have intensified, and winters are now shorter.\n\n“So, we all should be prepared to manage it to survive.”\n\nLocal volunteers\n\nThis training is made possible by volunteers trained to help others prepare for climate shocks.\n\nShakila Begum, 26, began volunteering with just two days of training. She works with the Climate Resilience Health System and Community initiative – supported by the UNFPA and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency – which educates women on topics from menstruation to childbirth during floods.\n\nMs. Begum is now the point of contact for 75 families, helping them with issues like family planning and maternal healthcare.\n\n“One woman had dangerously high blood pressure just before giving birth,” she recalled. “I advised her family to go to the local hospital, where she safely delivered – completely free of cost.”\n\n© UNFPA Bangladesh UNFPA Representative Catherine Breen Kamkong (centre) meets Shakila Begum (right, in green), a 26-year-old volunteer with the Climate Resilience Health System and Community Project in Sunamganj.\n\nEmpowerment through safe spaces\n\nThe initiative also offers safe community spaces where women can learn about sexual and reproductive health.\n\nIn Kurban Nagarn, an area in Sunamganj, volunteers have begun hosting “street dramas”. The volunteers act out scenes related to issues such as maternal health, disaster preparedness and child marriage prevention, with over 500 people attending each performance.\n\nTaskira Hauque Tazin, a local student, is one of the moving theatre’s core members. She has attended many conferences in Bangladesh and abroad, where she shares her experiences and is recognised for her work.\n\n“I feel proud to work for women’s empowerment and to support underprivileged communities. Through these plays, we raise awareness so that women don’t fall behind. We want to stop early marriage, promote girls’ education, and ensure that women get access to maternal health care,” she said. “Whether it’s in the sun, rain, or storm – we’ll keep doing this work for the people.”\n\n© UNFPA Bangladesh Villagers gather for an afternoon street drama in Bodipur, Kurban Nagar Union, Sunamganj, as part of the Climate Resilience Health System and Community Project.\n\nAnima Akhter, a 24-year-old mother in Kurban Nagarn, explained that the street dramas provide a safe space for difficult conversations: “We want to share our problems, especially about our bodies – but we often can’t speak.”\n\nWith the support of local volunteers, Anima delivered her youngest child safely at the hospital.\n\nAmina’s husband, Nurul, now accompanies her to community sessions and has become a role model in the community, receiving training from volunteers to teach his neighbours about women’s and girls’ health.\n\n“Since my wife underwent training, I took it very seriously and felt inspired to help our neighbours, especially concerning women’s and girls’ health,” he said. “I regularly talk about these important messages with other men at the tea stall, encouraging them to be prepared for disasters and to take the same precautions.\n\n“I urge them to seek help from service providers if they face any problems, especially concerning pregnant women’s deliveries and family planning methods.”\n\n© UNFPA Bangladesh Anima Akhter, 24, with her husband Ruhul Amin, 30, a steelworker, and their two children outside their home in Bodipur village in Kurban Nagar Union.\n\nOngoing challenges\n\nBut challenges remain despite the best efforts of the UNFPA and other UN partners.\n\nIn flood-prone villages in Sunamganj, over half of deliveries still occur at home.\n\nMany women and girls also still feel shame discussing topics like menstruation, and cultural norms often restrict women who attempt to generate their own income.\n\nThese vulnerabilities faced by women and girls are exacerbated by climate-related disasters, which often hit them the hardest.\n\nContinued commitments\n\nFrom 28 to 31 July, global experts convened at the Global Symposium on Climate Justice and Impacted Populations in Brasília, co-hosted by UNFPA and the Government of Brazil.\n\nThere, leaders worked to address the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and girls. The event called for gender-inclusive climate negotiations and a renewed commitment to understanding the impact climate change has on sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\nDiene Keita, Acting Executive Director of UNFPA, highlighted the gendered impact of climate change at the event: “The evidence tells us that climate change is increasing the risk of maternal mortality, disrupting access to contraceptives and increasing the risk of gender-based violence.”\n\n“Our collective efforts need to strengthen the resilience of women, girls and health systems to withstand and adapt to climate shocks,” Ms. Keita stressed. “Being prepared, responding rapidly, and building forward better must be central pillars for our work.”",
