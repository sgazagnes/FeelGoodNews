      "title": "Sweet-smelling molecule halts therapy-resistant pancreatic cancer",
      "content": "A compound best known for giving almonds and apricots their aroma may be the key to defeating hard-to-kill cancer cells. Japanese researchers found that benzaldehyde can stop the shape-shifting ability of aggressive cancer cells, which lets them dodge treatments and spread. By targeting a specific protein interaction essential for cancer survival—without harming normal cells—benzaldehyde and its derivatives could form the basis of powerful new therapies, especially when combined with existing radiation or targeted treatments.",
