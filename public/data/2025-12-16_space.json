      "content": "Career paths are rarely a straight line and often include some unexpected curves. That is certainly true for Erin Sholl, deputy chief of the Space Transportation Systems Division within the Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. From struggling with multiplication tables in elementary school to supporting the International Space Station from the Mission Control Center, her journey has been full of twists and turns.\n\nErin Sholl (second from right) received the Johnson Space Center Director’s Commendation Award in 2017 for significant achievements and exemplary contributions to the International Space Station and Commercial Crew Programs as the Safety and Mission Assurance Visiting Vehicles Group lead. NASA/James Blair\n\nDespite her early difficulties in math and science, Sholl eventually grew to love and excel in both subjects. She planned to study chemical engineering in college – inspired by a love of chemistry and a favorite high school teacher – but discovered a greater affinity for physics once she arrived at Pennsylvania State University. She switched her major to aerospace engineering and soon met a classmate who had interned at Johnson. After that, Sholl declared, “The dream was born!”\n\nHer first position at Johnson was as a trajectory operations officer for the Flight Operations Directorate. She spent six years supporting the space station on console in the Mission Control Center, describing the experience as “something out of the movies.” When Sholl went looking for a new challenge, she landed in the Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate.\n\nErin Sholl working on console as a trajectory operations officer in the Mission Control Center during the STS-128/17A mission in 2009. NASA/Lauren Harnett\n\n“I was drawn to the Operations and Visiting Vehicles Branch because it had many similar aspects to my previous position – real-time operations and visiting vehicles,” she said. “I worked various roles over the next 12 years, gradually taking on more responsibility, and eventually becoming a group lead, then branch chief.” Sholl also served as acting deputy chief for the Space Habitation Systems Division, which oversees the Operations and Visiting Vehicles Branch. Her performance drew the attention of the Space Transportation Systems Division’s chief. “He asked me to come be his deputy, and that is where I still am today!”\n\nThe Space Transportation Systems Division provides system safety, reliability, and risk analysis for human spaceflight programs. The division works with the different program offices to reduce risk through technical assessments and guidance on Safety and Mission Assurance requirements throughout program and project lifecycles.\n\nSholl works closely with the division chief to support strategic planning, budgeting, and operations. “A key part of my role is connecting with people – both inside and outside the division – to ensure smooth communication and representation of the team’s needs,” she said. She leverages her relationship-building and strategic thinking skills to lead initiatives that advance the division’s and the directorate’s goals and to mentor employees.\n\nErin Sholl (center) receives a certificate of achievement from Terrence Wilcutt, former director of the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA) at NASA Headquarters, and Patricia Petete, former director of SMA at Johnson, after completing requirements for the Safety and Mission Assurance Technical Excellence Program in System Safety. Image courtesy of Erin Sholl\n\nSholl believes strongly in the power of mentorship. “Having various mentors, both formal and informal, has been so important throughout my career,” she said. “Listening to what these people were saying about my strengths led me to a path I’d never considered because I hadn’t seen those things in myself.” Being a mentor and advocate for team members is one of Sholl’s favorite parts of the leadership positions she has held, particularly as branch chief. “I really felt like I could connect with my people and advocate for them in a way that felt meaningful,” she said.\n\nShe encourages young professionals to seek out mentors or opportunities to shadow colleagues in different roles. “Relationships are the key to everything,” she said. “The more people you meet and the more you learn about different paths in space exploration, the better off you will be in your career.”\n\nSusan Schuh, Flight Crew Integration Operational Habitability (OpsHab) team lead and Erin Sholl host a JSC Parenting community event in 2023. Image courtesy of Erin Sholl\n\nSholl noted that professional relationships can be bolstered by activities outside of the office. She played a key role in establishing and growing JSC Parenting, a virtual community of about 600 employees who share information and support each other on issues related to caregiving, schooling, and balancing work with family life. “My leadership within the community enhances my professional leadership and positively impacts my colleagues,” she said.\n\nSholl also emphasized the importance of being open to trying new things, even if an opportunity seems to diverge from your expected career path. “I volunteer for everything because I am always eager to learn more and find out what else I might be good at and how else I can serve my team,” she said. “I think it’s easy to feel intimidated hearing about other people’s career paths, because they often sound so perfectly planned and successful. You rarely hear about the pivots, setbacks, or decisions made for personal reasons.”\n\nThe reality, she added, is more complex. “I tried for many roles I didn’t get, and it took a lot of trial and error to find my path to a career I really love.”",

      "title": "New orbital clue reveals how hot Jupiters really formed",
      "summary": "Hot Jupiters were once cosmic oddities, but unraveling how they moved so close to their stars has remained a stubborn mystery. Scientists have long debated whether these giants were violently flung inward or peacefully drifted through their birth disks. A new approach from researchers in Tokyo cracks open this puzzle by using the timescale of orbital circularization as a diagnostic.",
      "content": "The first exoplanet ever confirmed in 1995 turned out to be what researchers now describe as a \"hot Jupiter,\" a giant world similar in mass to Jupiter but orbiting its star in only a few days. Scientists now think these planets originally formed far from their host stars, similar to how Jupiter formed in our own Solar System, and then later moved inward. Two leading explanations have been developed to describe how this inward shift occurs: (1) high-eccentricity migration, in which gravitational interactions with other objects stretch the planet's orbit before tidal forces close to the star eventually make it more circular; and (2) disk migration, in which the planet slowly spirals inward while still embedded in the surrounding protoplanetary disk.\n\nDetermining which of these two routes a specific hot Jupiter followed has been challenging. High-eccentricity migration can tilt a planet's orbital axis compared with the rotational axis of its star, creating a detectable misalignment. Yet tidal forces near the star can gradually erase that misalignment over time. Because an aligned orbit could result from either process, astronomers have lacked a dependable way to identify planets that formed through disk migration.\n\nA New Strategy Based on Migration Timescales\n\nTo overcome this problem, a team led by PhD student Yugo Kawai and Assistant Professor Akihiko Fukui at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the University of Tokyo, introduced a new method that focuses on the length of time required for high-eccentricity migration to occur.\n\nIn this migration scenario, a planet first follows a highly stretched path before its orbit becomes circular again as it repeatedly swings close to its star. The amount of time needed for this circularization depends on several factors, including the planet's mass, orbital characteristics, and tidal forces. For a hot Jupiter to have formed through high-eccentricity migration, this circularization time must be shorter than the age of its planetary system. After calculating circularization times for more than 500 known hot Jupiters, the researchers found about 30 planets that did not meet this requirement. These planets have circular orbits even though their calculated circularization times exceed the ages of their systems.\n\nEvidence Supporting Disk Migration\n\nThe hot Jupiters in this group also match other expectations for planets that traveled inward within a disk. Their orbits show no signs of misalignment, suggesting that their movement toward the star was smooth rather than heavily influenced by disruptive gravitational interactions. A number of these planets are also part of multi-planet systems, a configuration that high-eccentricity migration typically disrupts, since that process can scatter or eject neighboring planets.\n\nLooking Ahead to What These Planets Can Reveal\n\nFinding planets that retain clear evidence of how they migrated is essential for piecing together the history of planetary systems. Future studies of their atmospheres and elemental compositions may pinpoint the regions of the disk where they originally formed, offering deeper insight into the origins and evolution of hot Jupiters.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Hot Jupiters are giant planets like Jupiter but orbit very close to their stars, completing orbits in just a few days. Scientists have debated whether these planets moved inward violently or slowly after they formed far from their stars.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of Tokyo developed a new way to understand how hot Jupiters moved closer to their stars by studying how long it takes their orbits to become circular. They looked at over 500 hot Jupiters and found about 30 whose orbits are already circular even though the time needed for this to happen by violent movement is longer than the age of their systems. This suggests these planets moved inward smoothly through the disk of gas and dust around their stars.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery helps scientists tell which hot Jupiters moved inward quietly through their birth disks instead of being thrown inward by strong gravitational forces. It also explains why some of these planets have orbits aligned with their stars and why some live in systems with other planets nearby. This method gives a clearer picture of how planetary systems form and change.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to study the atmospheres and materials of these planets to learn more about where in the disk they formed. This could help explain how different kinds of planets develop and improve our understanding of planets beyond our Solar System.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new timing method shows that some hot Jupiters moved close to their stars smoothly through their birth disks, offering fresh clues about planet formation.",

Ils ont examiné plus de 500 Jupiters chauds et ont trouvé environ 30 planètes dont les orbites sont déjà circulaires, alors que le temps nécessaire pour cela en cas de mouvement violent est plus long que l’âge de leurs systèmes.
