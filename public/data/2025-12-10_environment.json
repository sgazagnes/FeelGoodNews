      "content": "\"We are one step closer to a greener and climate-friendlier food production.\"\n\nThat is the conclusion reached by Kasper Røjkjær Andersen and Simona Radutoiu, professors of molecular biology at Aarhus University.\n\nTheir new research highlights an important biological clue that could help reduce agriculture's heavy reliance on artificial fertilizer.\n\nPlants require nitrogen to grow, and most crop species can obtain it only through fertilizer. A small group of plants, including peas, clover, and beans, can grow without added nitrogen. They do this by forming a partnership with specific bacteria that turn nitrogen from the air into a form the plant can absorb.\n\nUnlocking the Secrets Behind Natural Nitrogen Fixation\n\nScientists worldwide are working to understand the genetic and molecular basis of this natural nitrogen-fixing ability. The hope is that this trait could eventually be introduced into major crops such as wheat, barley, and maize.\n\nIf achieved, these crops could supply their own nitrogen. This shift would reduce the need for synthetic fertilizer, which currently represents about two percent of global energy consumption and produces significant CO2 emissions.\n\nResearchers at Aarhus University have now identified small receptor changes in plants that cause them to temporarily shut down their immune defenses and enter a cooperative relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\n\nHow Plants Decide Between Defense and Cooperation\n\nPlants rely on cell-surface receptors to sense chemical signals from microorganisms in the soil.\n\nSome bacteria release compounds that warn the plant they are \"enemies,\" prompting defensive action. Others signal that they are \"friends\" able to supply nutrients.\n\nLegumes such as peas, beans, and clover allow specialized bacteria to enter their roots. Inside these root tissues, the bacteria convert nitrogen from the atmosphere and share it with the plant. This partnership, known as symbiosis, is the reason legumes can grow without artificial fertilizer.\n\nAarhus University researchers found that this ability is strongly influenced by just two amino acids, which act as small \"building blocks\" within a root protein.\n\n\"This is a remarkable and important finding,\" says Simona Radutoiu.\n\nThe root protein functions as a \"receptor\" that reads signals from bacteria. It determines whether the plant should activate its immune system (alarm) or accept the bacteria (symbiosis).\n\nThe team identified a small region in the receptor protein that they named Symbiosis Determinant 1. This region functions like a switch that controls which internal message the plant receives.\n\nBy modifying only two amino acids within this switch, the researchers changed a receptor that normally triggers immunity so that it instead initiated symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\n\n\"We have shown that two small changes can cause plants to alter their behavior on a crucial point -- from rejecting bacteria to cooperating with them,\" Radutoiu explains.\n\nExpanding the Potential to Major Food Crops\n\nIn laboratory experiments, the researchers successfully engineered this change in the plant Lotus japonicus. They then tested the concept in barley and found that the mechanism worked there as well.\n\n\"It is quite remarkable that we are now able to take a receptor from barley, make small changes in it, and then nitrogen fixation works again,\" says Kasper Røjkjær Andersen.\n\nThe long-term potential is significant. If these modifications can be applied to other cereals, it may ultimately be possible to breed wheat, maize, or rice capable of fixing nitrogen on their own, similar to legumes.\n\n\"But we have to find the other, essential keys first,\" Radutoiu notes.\n\n\"Only very few crops can perform symbiosis today. If we can extend that to widely used crops, it can really make a big difference on how much nitrogen needs to be used.\"",

Some plants like peas and beans can get nitrogen naturally by working with special bacteria that live in their roots and turn nitrogen from the air into a form plants can use.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Aarhus University found a tiny part of a root protein, controlled by just two amino acids, that decides if a plant will fight bacteria or let helpful nitrogen-fixing bacteria inside.

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn a world where news about endangered species is often bleak, a sprawling underwater canyon off the coast of Nova Scotia is offering something rare: hope.\n\nThere, in the dark, nutrient-rich waters of the Gully, a vast submarine canyon roughly the size of the Grand Canyon, Canada’s northern bottlenose whales are making a remarkable recovery. Once hunted to near collapse, these deep-diving whales are now rebounding after decades of protection, a new study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology found.\n\n“This study really does provide excellent evidence that knowledge of a species, its needs and its threats can be used to generate conservation success,” said Ari Friedlaender, a marine ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the research.\n\nWhat makes the Gully special\n\nThe Gully’s dramatic topography consists of steep walls, deep channels, and strong ocean currents, and creates ideal conditions for marine life to flourish. “At the broadest scale, submarine canyons stir up the oceanography, and that typically translates into more productivity, life and food—good for everything!” said Hal Whitehead, marine biologist at Dalhousie University and co-author of the study.\n\nThis makes the Gully a perfect year-round home for the Scotian Shelf population of northern bottlenose whales, a group classified as endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.\n\nWhitehead first encountered these whales in 1977 and was struck by their unusual friendliness. “These wonderful whales came up to the boat. Unlike most whales, they were friendly,” he recalled. “I thought, wow, that’s very cool.”\n\nUnfortunately, that same friendliness made them easy targets during the commercial whaling era. Before Canada banned whaling in 1972, whalers exploited their curious nature. “The whales would come around, and they just slaughtered them all,” Whitehead said.\n\nFrom collapse to cautious optimism\n\nBy the mid-2000s, decades of whaling and continued threats from fishing gear and ship strikes had pushed the Scotian Shelf population to just 130 individuals.\n\nBut in 2004, a turning point came when Canada designated the Gully as a Marine Protected Area (MPA) under legislation first passed in 1996. This law gave the government authority to protect ecologically valuable marine zones.\n\n“We worked with experts to find places that are high value for conservation and good science,” said Paul Macnab, senior oceans biologist and project lead for the Gully MPA. Though not involved in the study, Macnab noted the Gully was chosen as a place where the effectiveness of marine protection could be properly tested.\n\nIn the Gully’s core zone, commercial fishing and other harmful activities were banned, protecting both the whales and the prey they rely on.\n\nTracking the impact of protection\n\nTo understand whether the protections were actually helping, researchers used 35 years of observational data, analyzing both whale sightings and human activity in the area. What they found was promising.\n\nFishing and vessel traffic had declined significantly in the heart of the MPA. Meanwhile, the whale population grew by nearly two-thirds, reaching an estimated 210 individuals by 2023. That’s more than were present when Whitehead first studied them nearly five decades ago.\n\nA rare marine conservation win\n\nGlobally, northern bottlenose whales still face challenges. Low birth rates and ongoing risks like fishing gear entanglement continue to slow recovery in other regions. But in the Gully, years of consistent protections and monitoring have paid off.\n\n“The Gully is one of the few places where we’ve been able to track a distinct population long enough to see real trends,” said Whitehead.\n\nStill, as encouraging as the rebound is, scientists caution that a single protected canyon is not enough. Many marine species, including whales, migrate across vast ocean areas. “For many other species, it’s only part of their habitat, and we have to protect them in a lot of other ways,” Whitehead said.\n\nThat means developing networks of protected zones that safeguard marine life not just where they feed, but where they travel.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe Gully’s whales show what’s possible when science, policy, and long-term monitoring come together. It also highlights how marine protected areas, if properly enforced, can make a measurable difference for endangered species.\n\nAt a time when biodiversity loss dominates global headlines, the story from this deep-sea canyon is a reminder that recovery is possible with the right tools and commitment. And that, sometimes, protection pays off, not just for whales, but for the planet.\n\nSource study: Journal of Applied Ecology—Reversing decline: The impact of spatial conservation on endangered northern bottlenose whales",

Following a push from Parliament, further safeguards to the international carbon credits were incorporated in the text including the prevention of funding of projects in partner countries that run contrary to the strategic interests of the EU.\n\nThe Commission will analyse different options for the role of international credits in the upcoming EU climate legislation to reach the 2040-target and in this context made a statement recalling the need to ensure the stability of the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS).\n\nThe deal also includes the possibility for domestic permanent carbon removals to be used to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions in the ETS as well as enhanced flexibility within and across sectors and instruments to achieve targets that are as cost effective as possible.\n\nThe introduction of the EU’s ETS2 will also be postponed by one year from 2027 to 2028. ETS2 covers CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in buildings and road transport.\n\nReview of the 2040 target\n\nThe Commission will assess progress every second year, considering the most recent scientific data, technological developments, and the EU’s international competitiveness.\n\nThe review will assess the status of net removals at the EU level compared with what is necessary to meet the 2040 goal, as well as emerging implementation issues and the potential for enhancing EU industrial competitiveness. The review will also consider trends in energy prices and their repercussions for both businesses and households.\n\nFollowing the conclusions of the review, the Commission will propose an amendment to the EU climate law if appropriate. This could involve modifying the 2040 target or taking additional measures to strengthen the supporting framework - for instance to safeguard the EU’s competitiveness, prosperity, and social stability.\n\nNext steps\n\nParliament will now vote on the informal agreement and Council will also have to endorse it.

NASA/Christopher LC Clark\n\nCalled AVIRIS-5, it’s the latest in a long line of sensors pioneered by NASA JPL to survey Earth, the Moon, and other worlds.\n\nCradled in the nose of a high-altitude research airplane, a new NASA sensor has taken to the skies to help geoscientists map rocks hosting lithium and other critical minerals on Earth’s surface some 60,000 feet below. In collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the flights are part of the largest airborne campaign of its kind in the country’s history.\n\nBut that’s just one of many tasks that are on the horizon for AVIRIS-5, short for Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-5, which has a lot in common with sensors used to explore other planets.\n\nNASA’s AVIRIS flies aboard a research plane in this animation, detecting minerals on the ground such as hectorite — a lithium-bearing clay — by the unique patterns of light that they reflect. The different wavelengths, measured in nanometers, look like colorful squiggles in the box on the right.

Like its cousins flying in space, the sensor takes advantage of the fact that all kinds of molecules, from rare earth elements to flower pigments, have unique chemical structures that absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light.\n\nThe technology was pioneered at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California in the late 1970s. Over the decades, imaging spectrometers have visited every major rocky body in the solar system from Mercury to Pluto. They’ve traced Martian crust in full spectral detail, revealed lakes on Titan, and tracked mineral-rich dust across the Sahara and other deserts. One is en route to Europa, an ocean moon of Jupiter, to search for the chemical ingredients needed to support life.\n\nImage cubes illustrate the volume of data returned by JPL imaging spectrometers. The front panel shows roads and fields around Tulare, California, as seen by AVIRIS-5 during a checkout flight earlier this year. The side panels depict the spectral fingerprint captured for every point in the image. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nAnother imaging spectrometer, NASA’s Moon Mineralogy Mapper, was the first to discover water on the lunar surface in 2009. “That dataset continues to drive our investigations as we look for in situ resources on the Moon” as part of NASA’s Artemis campaign, said Robert Green, a senior research scientist at NASA JPL who’s contributed to multiple spectroscopy missions across the solar system.\n\nPrisms, black silicon\n\nWhile imaging spectrometers vary depending on their mission, they have certain hardware in common — including mirrors, detector arrays, and electron-beam gratings — designed to capture light shimmering off a surface and then separate it into its constituent colors, like a prism.\n\nLight-trapping black silicon is one of the darkest materials ever fabricated. The technology is standard for JPL’s ultraprecise imaging spectrometers. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nMany of the best-in-class imaging spectrometers flying today were made possible by components invented at NASA JPL’s Microdevices Laboratory. Instrument-makers there combine breakthroughs in physics, chemistry, and material science with the classical properties of light discovered by physicist Isaac Newton in the 17th century. Newton’s prism experiments revealed that visible light is composed of a rainbow of colors.\n\nToday, NASA JPL engineers work with advanced materials such as black silicon — one of the darkest substances ever manufactured — to push performance. Under a powerful microscope, black silicon looks like a forest of spiky needles. Etched by lasers or chemicals, the nanoscale structures prevent stray light from interfering with the sample by trapping it in their spikes.\n\nTreasure hunting\n\nThe optical techniques used at the Microdevices Laboratory have advanced continuously since the first AVIRIS instrument took flight in 1986. Four generations of these sensors have now hit the skies, analyzing erupting volcanoes, diseased crops, ground zero debris in New York City, and wildfires in Alabama, among many other deployments. The latest model, AVIRIS-5, features spatial resolution that’s twice as fine as that of its predecessor and can resolve areas ranging from less than a foot (30 centimeters) to about 30 feet (10 meters).\n\nSo far this year, it has logged more than 200 hours of high-altitude flights over Nevada, California, and other Western states as part of a project called GEMx (Geological Earth Mapping Experiment). The flights are conducted using NASA’s ER-2 aircraft, operated out of the agency’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. The effort is the airborne component of a larger USGS initiative, called Earth Mapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI), to modernize mapping of the nation’s surface and subsurface.\n\nThe NASA and USGS team has, since 2023, gathered data over more than 366,000 square miles (950,000 square kilometers) of the American West, where dry, treeless expanses are well suited to mineral spectroscopy.\n\nAn exciting early finding is a lithium-bearing clay called hectorite, identified in the tailings of an abandoned mine in California, among other locations. Lithium is one of about 50 minerals at risk of supply chain disruption that USGS has deemed critical to national security and the economy.\n\nHelping communities capture new value from old and abandoned prospects is one of the long-term aspirations of GEMx, said Dana Chadwick, an Earth system scientist at NASA JPL. So is identifying sources of acid mine drainage, which can occur when waste rocks weather and leach into the environment.\n\n“The breadth of different questions you can take on with this technology is really exciting, from land management to snowpack water resources to wildfire risk,” Chadwick said. “Critical minerals are just the beginning for AVIRIS-5.”\n\nMore about GEMx\n\nThe GEMx research project is expected to last four years and is funded by the USGS Earth MRI, through investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The initiative will capitalize on both the technology developed by NASA for spectroscopic imaging, as well as the expertise in analyzing the datasets and extracting critical mineral information from them.\n\nTo learn more about GEMx visit:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/gemx/\n\nNews Media Contacts\n\nAndrew Wang / Andrew Good\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n\n626-379-6874 / 818-393-2433\n\nandrew.wang@jpl.nasa.gov / andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nWritten by Sally Younger\n\n2025-136",
