      "content": "Researchers have grown pea-sized brains in the lab that are offering an unprecedented look at how neurons behave differently in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These psychiatric conditions affect millions of people worldwide, yet they remain difficult to diagnose because scientists have not fully understood their underlying molecular causes.\n\nThe findings could eventually help doctors reduce mistakes in diagnosing and treating mental health disorders. Today, many psychiatric conditions are identified through clinical judgment alone and treated using a trial-and-error approach to medication.\n\nThe research was published in the journal APL Bioengineering.\n\nWhy Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Are Hard to Diagnose\n\n\"Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are very hard to diagnose because no particular part of the brain goes off. No specific enzymes are going off like in Parkinson's, another neurological disease where doctors can diagnose and treat based on dopamine levels even though it still doesn't have a proper cure,\" said Annie Kathuria, a Johns Hopkins University biomedical engineer who led the study. \"Our hope is that in the future we can not only confirm a patient is schizophrenic or bipolar from brain organoids, but that we can also start testing drugs on the organoids to find out what drug concentrations might help them get to a healthy state.\"\n\nHow Scientists Built and Studied Brain Organoids\n\nTo conduct the study, Kathuria's team created brain organoids, which are simplified versions of real human organs. They started by turning blood and skin cells from patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and from healthy individuals into stem cells capable of developing into brain-like tissue.\n\nThe team then used machine learning tools to analyze the electrical activity of cells inside these mini brains. In the human brain, neurons communicate by sending brief electrical signals to one another, and the researchers focused on identifying patterns in that activity linked to healthy and unhealthy brain function.\n\nElectrical Biomarkers Identify Mental Illness\n\nThe scientists found that specific features of the organoids' electrical behavior acted as biomarkers for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Using these signals alone, they were able to correctly identify which organoids came from affected patients 83% of the time. When the tissue received gentle electrical stimulation designed to bring out more neural activity, accuracy increased to 92%.\n\nThe patterns they uncovered were complex and highly specific. Neurons from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients showed unusual firing spikes and timing changes across multiple electrical measurements, creating a distinct signature for each condition.\n\n\"At least molecularly, we can check what goes wrong when we are making these brains in a dish and distinguish between organoids from a healthy person, a schizophrenia patient, or a bipolar patient based on these electrophysiology signatures,\" Kathuria said. \"We track the electrical signals produced by neurons during development, comparing them to organoids from patients without these mental health disorders.\"\n\nUsing Microchips to Map Brain Activity\n\nTo better understand how neurons formed networks, the researchers placed the organoids on microchips equipped with multi-electrode arrays arranged like a grid. This setup allowed them to collect data in a way similar to a tiny electroencephalogram, or EEG, the test doctors use to measure brain activity in patients.\n\nWhen fully developed, the organoids reached about three millimeters in diameter. They contained multiple types of neural cells normally found in the brain's prefrontal cortex, a region involved in higher-level thinking. The mini brains also produced myelin, a substance that insulates nerve cells and helps electrical signals travel more efficiently.\n\nToward Personalized Psychiatric Treatments\n\nThe study included samples from just 12 patients, but Kathuria believes the results point toward meaningful clinical applications. The organoids could eventually serve as a testing platform for psychiatric medications before those drugs are prescribed to patients.\n\nThe team is now collaborating with neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists at the John Hopkins School of Medicine. They are collecting additional blood samples from psychiatric patients to study how different drug concentrations affect organoid activity. Even with a limited number of samples, the researchers believe they may be able to suggest medication doses that help restore healthier neural patterns.\n\n\"That's how most doctors give patients these drugs, with a trial-and-error method that may take six or seven months to finds the right drug,\" Kathuria said. \"Clozapine is the most common drug prescribed for schizophrenia, but about 40% of patients are resistant to it. With our organoids, maybe we won't have to do that trial-and-error period. Maybe we can give them the right drug sooner than that.\"",

      "summary": "Professor Green and Ryan Libbey open up about how fatherhood affected them and how you can protect your mental health.",
      "content": "The words from my dad that saved me as a new parent\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Alex Taylor BBC News reporter Share Save\n\nRyan Libbey Ryan says that becoming a dad to Leo has helped him better understand himself\n\n\"I think I was just in survival mode for a year\". Former Made In Chelsea star Ryan Libbey expected to cope with the challenges of becoming a dad. But the reality quickly became \"very different\" to what he'd imagined. Life-threatening health complications around the birth saw his partner Louise hospitalised. Suddenly he was thrust into becoming her primary caregiver as well as looking after their newborn son Leo. \"I was doing every night time, every change… every walk. The role of both mum and dad,\" Ryan told the BBC's Parenting Download. After 11 months he burnt out. It was a chat with his own dad, on a park bench, that made him realise he needed help. The simple words \"You're not in a good spot. You need some help. How can I help you?\" opened the door for Ryan to speak honestly, seek support and find a way back. His experience is not uncommon, but rarely discussed. While society is now better used to talking about the strain on mums and about post-natal depression, less is said about the struggles dads face. According to the government's recent men's health strategy for England, between 5-15% of fathers experience anxiety before and after they have a child, while 5-10% face depression.\n\n'It's not weak to ask for help'\n\nRyan feels his struggles are part of a wider failure to communicate amongst men, who still internalise harmful perceptions of masculinity. Men, he says, often feel they must be \"the harbour wall that just gets smashed and remains standing every time.\" \"It's not a show of weakness to ask for help. I didn't do that quick enough,\" he explains.\n\nGetty Images Professor Green aka Stephen Manderson chooses to keep his son's face hidden in public photos\n\nClinical psychologist Dr Jill Domoney, a researcher specialising in mental health pre and post childbirth, says men often don't want to accept they're struggling. They can feel they are \"not a legitimate person to be asking for help\" - especially ahead of a mum and baby - but she emphasises their mental well-being is just as important to the family. Ryan's conversation with his dad gave him the space to ask for a break - taking a few days abroad, away from the home environment, to gain perspective. He realised he needed to make a shift to focus on his and his partner's emotions as well as the practical tasks of taking care of a new baby. When he opened up to Louise, he realised he'd missed \"what she was yearning\" -holding her hand and listening to her.\n\n'Parenting yourself'\n\nThat realisation has reshaped how Ryan sees fatherhood. He's now writing Leo weekly letters about his experiences as a dad, which he hopes his son will read as he gets older. Ryan hopes these will help his son better understand the language of emotion and make sense of his parenting choices. The idea of \"self-parenting\" is something rapper and songwriter Professor Green - real name Stephen Manderson - has also felt keenly since fathering his son Slimane, who is now four. As a child Stephen lacked consistent male parenting. Despite having an \"incredible\" bond with his dad, deep-held trauma meant his father struggled to cope and was \"in and out\" of his life, complicating their relationship. Stephen says suppressing feelings led him to make \"terrible decisions\" when younger to alter how he felt, finding solace in drink and drugs as escapism from the pain. \"You find your way to things that don't help,\" he explains. \"They may temporarily change how you feel, but they will ultimately make things worse.\"\n\nTips for coping as a new dad\n\nProfessor Green and Ryan Libbey with Parenting Download co-hosts Gunva B (right) and Katie Thistleton (left)\n\nTalk to someone - if you're feeling overwhelmed, tell a friend, your partner or a professional how you're feeling. It can help to ease the pressure and make you feel less alone Remember your hobbies - keep doing the things that helped you to feel like yourself before having a baby. It could be going for a run, seeing friends or playing video games. Don't ignore the physical stuff - eating well, getting some exercise and if you can, getting some sleep, all play a role in how your mind is doing. Spend time with other new dads - hearing about their experiences, the messy ones, as well as the good ones, can help to normalise how you're feeling Know that asking for help isn't failing - looking after yourself is the best way you can look after your family",

Scientists analyzed decades of research and found little reliable evidence that popular approaches like probiotics, acupuncture, or music therapy truly work. Alarmingly, safety was often ignored, with many treatments never properly evaluated for side effects. The researchers stress that looking at the full body of evidence matters far more than trusting a single hopeful study.",
      "content": "The most wide ranging quantitative analysis of research on complementary and alternative treatments for autism has found no strong evidence that these approaches are effective. The review also found that safety was often overlooked, with many treatments never properly evaluated for possible risks.\n\nThe study was led by researchers from Paris Nanterre University, Paris Cité University, and the University of Southampton and published in Nature Human Behaviour. It examined 248 meta analyses, drawing on results from 200 clinical trials that together involved more than 10,000 participants.\n\nWhat Treatments Were Examined\n\nThe researchers focused on complementary, alternative and integrative medicines (CAIMs) used to treat autism. In total, they evaluated 19 different types of interventions. These included animal assisted therapies, acupuncture, herbal medicine, music therapy, probiotics, and Vitamin D supplementation.\n\nAlongside the analysis, the research team developed an online platform designed to help the public explore the scientific evidence behind different CAIMs more easily.\n\nWhy These Treatments Are Widely Used\n\nAutistic people may experience challenges with communication, understanding others' thoughts or emotions, managing sensory overload, coping with unfamiliar environments, and engaging in repetitive behaviors. These difficulties can affect daily life and overall wellbeing.\n\nAs a result, interest in alternative treatments is widespread. Studies suggest that up to 90 percent of autistic individuals report having tried at least one CAIM at some point in their lives.\n\n\"Many parents of autistic children, as well as autistic adults, turn to complementary and alternative medicines hoping they may help without unwanted side effects,\" says Professor Richard Delorme, Head of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit at Robert Debré Hospital in Paris.\n\n\"However, it is necessary to carefully consider evidence from rigorous randomized trials before concluding that these treatments should be tried.\"\n\nHow the Evidence Was Evaluated\n\nTo assess the full scope of existing research, the team conducted an umbrella review, a method that combines findings from multiple meta analyses to provide an overall big picture assessment.\n\nDr. Corentin Gosling, Associate Professor at the Paris Nanterre University and first author of the study, explains: \"Rather than looking at individual trials, we reviewed all the available meta-analyses, which are a compilation of many trials. This allowed us to evaluate the full body of evidence across different treatments.\n\n\"Importantly, we also developed a free and easy-to-use online platform, which we will continue to test. Ultimately, we hope this tool will support autistic people and practitioners in choosing together the best treatment.\"\n\nWeak Evidence and Limited Safety Data\n\nAlthough a small number of treatments showed signs of potential benefit, most were backed by weak or low quality evidence, making the reported effects unreliable. The researchers also raised concerns about safety, noting that fewer than half of the treatments had been assessed for acceptability, tolerability, or adverse events.\n\nProfessor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at the University of Southampton and co senior author, emphasized the importance of looking beyond individual studies. \"This study shows that when people want to know whether a treatment is effective, they shouldn't just look at one single study. It's essential to consider all the available evidence and how good that evidence is. Drawing conclusions from one low-quality study can be misleading.\"\n\nStudy Details and Funding\n\nThe study Complementary, alternative and integrative medicine for autism: an umbrella review and online platform is published in Nature Human Behaviour and is available online.\n\nThe online platform is available at: https://ebiact-database.com\n\nThe research was funded by Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR).",
