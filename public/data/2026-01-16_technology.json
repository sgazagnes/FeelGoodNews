      "title": "Stretchable OLED displays take a big leap forward",
      "summary": "A new OLED design can stretch dramatically while staying bright, solving a problem that has long limited flexible displays. The breakthrough comes from pairing a highly efficient light-emitting material with tough, transparent MXene-based electrodes. Tests showed the display kept most of its brightness even after repeated stretching. The technology could power future wearable screens and on-skin health sensors.",
      "content": "The OLED technology found in flexible smartphones, curved computer monitors, and modern televisions may eventually be used in wearable devices that sit directly on the skin. These future systems could display real-time information such as changes in temperature, blood flow, or pressure. An international research team led by scientists from Seoul National University in the Republic of Korea and Drexel University has now developed a flexible and stretchable OLED that could move this idea closer to real-world use and unlock new applications.\n\nThe research, recently published in Nature, introduces a redesigned OLED that combines a flexible phosphorescent polymer layer with transparent electrodes made from MXene nanomaterial. This approach allows the display to stretch up to 1.6 times its original length while retaining most of its brightness.\n\n\"This study addresses a longstanding challenge in flexible OLED technology, namely, the durability of its luminescence after repeated mechanical flexion,\" said Yury Gogotsi, PhD, Distinguished University and Bach professor in Drexel's College of Engineering. \"While the advances creating flexible light-emitting diodes have been substantial, progress has leveled off in the last decade due to limitations introduced by the transparent conductor layer, limiting their stretchability.\"\n\nWhy OLEDs Lose Performance When Bent\n\nOLEDs generate light through a process known as electroluminescence. When electricity flows through the device, positive and negative charges move between electrodes and pass through an organic polymer layer. When these charges meet, they release light and form a particle called an exciton before settling into a stable electrical state. Adjusting the chemical composition of the organic layer determines the color of the emitted light.\n\nFlexible OLEDs are made by depositing these layers onto bendable plastic substrates, allowing them to function while folded, bent, or rolled. The technology was first developed in the 1990s and became widely visible in the 2010s when Samsung incorporated flexible displays into shatter-resistant devices and curved-edge phones. Over time, however, it became clear that repeated bending caused OLED brightness and flexibility to decline due to gradual damage in the electrodes and organic materials.\n\n\"Imparting conducting materials with flexibility usually involves incorporating an insulating but stretchable polymer that hinders charge transport and, as a result, reduces light emission,\" said Danzhen Zhang, PhD, a co-author and postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University, who conducted early work on transparent conductive MXene films as a PhD student in Gogotsi's lab at Drexel. \"In addition, the material most commonly used in electrodes can become brittle and more likely to break the longer the OLED is flexed and stretched. This issue was addressed by using MXene-contact stretchable electrodes, which feature high mechanical robustness and tunable work function, ensuring efficient hole or electron injection.\"\n\nA New Light-Emitting Layer\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the researchers redesigned the light-emitting portion of the OLED. Their solution uses a specialized organic layer that increases how often electrical charges combine to form excitons, leading to stronger light output.\n\nThis material, called an exciplex-assisted phosphorescent (ExciPh) layer, is naturally stretchable and engineered to adjust the energy levels of moving charges. By making it easier for charges to meet and form excitons, the layer boosts light production, similar to slowing a spinning ride so more people can step on safely.\n\nMore than 57% of excitons created in the ExciPh layer are converted into light. In comparison, the polymer-based emissive layers commonly used in today's OLEDs achieve only a 12-22% conversation efficiency rate.\n\nTo further improve flexibility, the team incorporated a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer matrix into the ExciPh layer. They also focused on improving how electrical charges move through the device by redesigning the electrodes.\n\nMXene Electrodes Boost Durability and Brightness\n\nThe new electrodes combine MXene, a highly conductive two-dimensional nanomaterial developed by Drexel researchers in 2011, with silver nanowires. Together, these materials form a conductive network that helps electrical charges reach the light-emitting polymer layer more efficiently before forming excitons.\n\nThis structure improves charge injection and allows the OLED to maintain its brightness even while being bent and stretched.\n\n\"Owing to their exceptional conductivity and layered form, MXenes provide an exceptional electrode material for flexible OLEDs,\" Gogotsi said. \"We have demonstrated the performance of flexible, transparent MXene electrodes in multiple applications; thus, including them in efforts to improve OLED technology is a natural step for our research.\"\n\nTesting OLEDs Under Repeated Strain\n\nUsing these combined improvements, the researchers produced flexible green OLED displays, including one shaped like a heart and another showing numerical digits. They measured the charge-to-exciton conversion rate -- a measure of the OLEDs' ability to efficiently produce light -- along with performance during repeated stretching.\n\nTo demonstrate broader potential, researchers at Seoul National University also built a full-color, fully stretchable OLED display using four dopant materials within the ExciPh layer. In addition, they created fully stretchable passive-matrix OLEDs that showcase a simple, low-power design suitable for wearable electronics.\n\nCompared with previous designs, the new OLEDs showed higher brightness and better energy efficiency. When stretched to 60% of their maximum strain, performance dropped by only 10.6%. After 100 cycles of repeated stretching at 2% strain, the displays retained 83% of their light output, indicating significantly improved durability.\n\nToward Wearable and Deformable Displays\n\n\"We anticipate the success of this approach to designing flexible, high-efficiency optoelectronic devices will enable the next generation of wearable and deformable displays,\" said Teng Zhang, PhD, a co-author and former post-doctoral researcher in Gogotsi's lab. \"This technology will play an important role in real-time health care monitoring and wearable communications technology.\n\nFuture work may involve testing alternative flexible substrates, fine-tuning organic layers to produce different colors and brightness levels, and simplifying the manufacturing process to support large-scale production of stretchable OLED devices.",

      "title": "Electrons stop acting like particles—and physics still works",
      "summary": "Physicists have long relied on the idea that electrons behave like tiny particles zipping through materials, even though quantum physics says their exact position is fundamentally uncertain. Now, researchers at TU Wien have discovered something surprising: a material where this particle picture completely breaks down can still host exotic topological states—features once thought to depend on particle-like behavior.",
      "content": "Quantum physics shows that particles do not behave like solid objects with fixed locations. Instead, they act more like waves, which means their exact position in space cannot be precisely known. Even so, in many everyday situations, scientists can still describe particles in a familiar, classical way. They picture them as tiny objects moving through space with a specific speed.\n\nThis approach works well when explaining how electricity flows through metals. Physicists often describe electric current as electrons speeding through a material, pushed or redirected by electromagnetic forces as they move.\n\nWhy the Particle Picture Usually Works\n\nMany modern theories also rely on this particle-based view, including the idea of topological states of matter. These states are so important that their discovery was recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2016. Despite their advanced mathematics, these theories still assume electrons behave like particles with defined motion.\n\nHowever, researchers have found that this picture does not apply to every material (see publication below). In some cases, electrons no longer behave like individual particles with a clear position or a single, well-defined velocity.\n\nTopology Without Particles\n\nScientists at TU Wien have now demonstrated that even when the particle picture fails, materials can still display topological properties. Until now, these properties were thought to depend on particle-like behavior.\n\nThis finding reveals something unexpected. Topological states are not limited to systems where electrons act like particles. Instead, these states turn out to be far more universal, bringing together ideas that once seemed incompatible.\n\nWhen the Particle Picture No Longer Makes Sense\n\n\"The classical picture of electrons as small particles that suffer collisions as they flow through a material as an electric current is surprisingly robust,\" says Prof. Silke Bühler-Paschen from the Institute of Solid State Physics at TU Wien. \"With certain refinements, it works even in complex materials where electrons interact strongly with one another.\"\n\nThere are, however, extreme cases where this description breaks down entirely. In these situations, the charge carriers lose their particle-like nature. This behavior appears in a compound made of cerium, ruthenium and tin (CeRu₄Sn₆), which researchers at TU Wien studied at extremely low temperatures.\n\n\"Near absolute zero, it exhibits a specific type of quantum-critical behavior,\" says Diana Kirschbaum, first author of the current publication. \"The material fluctuates between two different states, as if it cannot decide which one it wants to adopt. In this fluctuating regime, the quasiparticle picture is thought to lose its meaning.\"\n\nTopology Explained With Rolls and Donuts\n\nAt the same time, theoretical work suggested that this same material should host topological states. \"The term topology comes from mathematics, where it is used to distinguish certain geometric structures,\" explains Silke Bühler-Paschen.\n\n\"For example, an apple is topologically equivalent to a bread roll, because the roll can be continuously deformed into the shape of an apple. A roll is topologically different from a donut, however, because the donut has a hole that cannot be created by continuous deformation.\"\n\nPhysicists use similar ideas to describe states of matter. Properties such as particle energy, velocity, and even the orientation of spin relative to motion can follow strict geometric patterns. These patterns are remarkably stable. Minor imperfections in a material do not erase them, just as small changes in shape cannot transform a donut into an apple.\n\nThis stability makes topological effects especially appealing for technologies like quantum data storage, advanced sensors, and methods of guiding electric currents without using magnetic fields.\n\nA Theory That Should Not Have Worked\n\nAlthough topology may sound abstract, past theories still depended on the assumption that particles have well-defined motion. \"These theories assume that one is describing something with well-defined velocities and energies,\" explains Diana Kirschbaum.\n\n\"But such well-defined velocities and energies do not seem to exist in our material, because it exhibits a form of quantum-critical behavior that is considered to be incompatible with a particle picture. Nevertheless, simple theoretical approaches that ignore these non-particle-like properties had previously predicted that the material should show topological characteristics.\"\n\nThis created a puzzling contradiction between theory and physical behavior.\n\nCuriosity Leads to a Breakthrough\n\nBecause of this conflict, Bühler-Paschen's team was initially reluctant to pursue the theoretical prediction further. Over time, curiosity won out, and Diana Kirschbaum began looking for experimental signs of topology.\n\nAt temperatures less than one degree above absolute zero, she observed a clear signal. The material displayed a spontaneous (anomalous) Hall effect, a phenomenon normally caused when charge carriers are deflected by a magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, however, the deflection appeared without any external magnetic field at all. Instead, it arose from the material's topological properties. Even more striking, the charge carriers behaved as if they were particles, despite strong evidence that the particle picture should not apply.\n\n\"This was the key insight that allowed us to demonstrate beyond doubt that the prevailing view must be revised,\" says Silke Bühler-Paschen.\n\n\"And there is more,\" adds Diana Kirschbaum. \"The topological effect is strongest precisely where the material exhibits the largest fluctuations. When these fluctuations are suppressed by pressure or magnetic fields, the topological properties disappear.\"\n\nA Broader View of Topological Matter\n\n\"This was a huge surprise,\" says Silke Bühler-Paschen. \"It shows that topological states should be defined in generalized terms.\"\n\nThe researchers describe the newly identified phase as an emergent topological semimetal. They worked with collaborators at Rice University in Texas, where Lei Chen (co-first author of the publication), part of Prof. Qimiao Si's research group, developed a theoretical model that successfully links quantum criticality with topology.\n\n\"In fact, it turns out that a particle picture is not required to generate topological properties,\" says Bühler-Paschen. \"The concept can indeed be generalized -- the topological distinctions then emerge in a more abstract, mathematical way. And more than that: our experiments suggest that topological properties can even arise because particle-like states are absent.\"\n\nNew Paths to Discover Quantum Materials\n\nThe discovery also has practical importance. It suggests a new way to search for topological materials by focusing on systems that exhibit quantum-critical behavior.\n\n\"We now know that it is worthwhile -- perhaps even particularly worthwhile -- to search for topological properties in quantum-critical materials,\" Bühler-Paschen says. \"Because quantum-critical behavior occurs in many classes of materials and can be reliably identified, this connection may allow many new 'emergent' topological materials to be discovered.\"",

Endo-epitaxial growth occurring in patterned templates presents a promising strategy to realize extensive patterned areas in heterostructures, as recently demonstrated with two-dimensional (2D) covalent materials9,10,11,12,13.

We demonstrate that the square holes form through spontaneous etching, a process initiated by internal strain and stabilized along the [100]/[010] crystallographic direction. Furthermore, the size of the square holes can be controlled by adjusting the etching time and temperature. Moreover, by incorporating a rapid solvent evaporation growth technique, the edges of the square holes act as templates for epitaxial growth of another type of perovskite, incorporating different halide or metal ions.

      "content": "It's difficult to form a protective coating that prolongs battery life at the battery's cathode, but there may be a low-cost chemical solution\n\nLithium-ion batteries could eventually last longer Shutterstock/Bokeh Art Photo\n\nIt may be possible to extend the life of lithium-ion batteries using standard, low-cost chemistry.\n\nLithium-ion batteries consist of a negative anode and a positive cathode with a porous separator between the two. This is immersed in an electrolyte that enables lithium ions to shuttle between the electrodes during charge and discharge.\n\nAt the negative electrode, the electrolyte breaks down to form a thin protective coating that keeps the battery stable and prolongs its lifespan.\n\nChunsheng Wang at the University of Maryland says that creating a similar protective layer on the cathode has always been considered much more difficult because the electrical conditions there are different, creating a more reactive environment and causing conventional electrolytes to break down before a stable coating can form.\n\nWang and his colleagues overcame this hurdle using a simple reaction borrowed from organic chemistry, which makes the electrolyte more “willing” to accept electrons and steers its breakdown into a controlled process that builds a stable protective coating at the cathode.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Weekly The best of New Scientist, including long-reads, culture, podcasts and news, each week. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“By guiding how the electrolyte breaks down at the molecular level, we were able to precisely control the protective layer that forms on the cathode,” says Xiyue Zhang, a postdoctoral research associate in Wang’s group.\n\nThe chemistry is also flexible. The resulting cathode-electrolyte layer can be tuned to be either more protective, strongly shielding the cathode, or less protective, offering weaker protection but allowing faster electrochemical reactions and providing additional energy. This means batteries can be optimised to give maximum power and energy or longer lifespan and stability.\n\n“If one can ensure the formation of the [cathode-electrolyte layer], this will be a step forward in ensuring longer cycling of the battery,” says Michel Armand at CIC energiGUNE, an energy storage research centre in Spain. Given that Wang and his colleagues used well-established chemical procedures to modify the battery design, such batteries should be safe and easy to manufacture, says Armand.\n\nIt is currently unclear by exactly how much the new approach could boost the longevity of lithium-ion batteries, but this should become clearer later in the technology’s development.\n\n“It is a relatively straightforward tweak to existing batteries,” says Wang. “After safety and long-cycle tests, this approach [could] realistically reach consumers.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Lithium-ion batteries power many devices like phones and electric cars. These batteries have two parts called electrodes: the anode (negative side) and the cathode (positive side). A liquid called electrolyte helps lithium ions move between these parts to charge and discharge the battery. \n\n**What happened** – Researchers led by Chunsheng Wang at the University of Maryland found a new, low-cost chemical method to create a protective layer on the cathode. This layer forms when the electrolyte breaks down in a controlled way, protecting the cathode from damage. Previously, it was hard to make such a protective coating on the cathode because of its reactive environment.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because the protective layer can help batteries last longer and work better. The new method also allows scientists to adjust how strong the protection is, which can either make the battery safer and longer-lasting or give it more power. Since the method uses common chemistry, it could be easy and cheap to add to current batteries.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers will test how much longer batteries can last with this method and check that it is safe for regular use. If successful, this improvement could soon be used in everyday batteries for electronics and electric cars.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A simple chemical tweak could help lithium-ion batteries last longer and work better by protecting the cathode with a new stable coating.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les batteries lithium-ion alimentent de nombreux appareils comme les téléphones et les voitures électriques. Ces batteries ont deux parties appelées électrodes : l’anode (côté négatif) et la cathode (côté positif). Un liquide appelé électrolyte aide les ions lithium à se déplacer entre ces parties pour charger et décharger la batterie.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs dirigés par Chunsheng Wang à l’Université du Maryland ont trouvé une nouvelle méthode chimique peu coûteuse pour créer une couche protectrice sur la cathode. Cette couche se forme lorsque l’électrolyte se décompose de manière contrôlée, protégeant la cathode des dommages. Avant, il était difficile de créer cette protection à cause de l’environnement réactif de la cathode.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte est importante car la couche protectrice peut aider les batteries à durer plus longtemps et à mieux fonctionner. La nouvelle méthode permet aussi d’ajuster la protection, soit pour rendre la batterie plus sûre et durable, soit pour lui donner plus de puissance. Comme la méthode utilise une chimie courante, elle pourrait être facile et peu coûteuse à appliquer aux batteries actuelles.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs vont tester combien de temps les batteries peuvent durer avec cette méthode et vérifier qu’elle est sûre pour un usage courant. Si cela réussit, cette amélioration pourrait bientôt être utilisée dans les batteries des appareils du quotidien et des voitures électriques.\n\n**En une phrase** – Un simple ajustement chimique pourrait prolonger la vie des batteries lithium-ion en protégeant la cathode avec un nouveau revêtement stable.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Las baterías de iones de litio alimentan muchos dispositivos como teléfonos y autos eléctricos. Estas baterías tienen dos partes llamadas electrodos: el ánodo (lado negativo) y el cátodo (lado positivo). Un líquido llamado electrolito ayuda a que los iones de litio se muevan entre estas partes para cargar y descargar la batería.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigadores liderados por Chunsheng Wang en la Universidad de Maryland encontraron un método químico nuevo y de bajo costo para crear una capa protectora en el cátodo. Esta capa se forma cuando el electrolito se descompone de manera controlada, protegiendo el cátodo del daño. Antes era difícil formar esta capa debido al ambiente muy reactivo del cátodo.\n\n**Impacto** – Este descubrimiento es importante porque la capa protectora puede ayudar a que las baterías duren más y funcionen mejor. El método también permite ajustar la protección para que la batería sea más segura y duradera o para que tenga más potencia. Como se usa química común, podría ser fácil y barato aplicar esto a las baterías actuales.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores probarán cuánto más pueden durar las baterías con este método y verificarán que sea seguro para uso común.
