      "content": "Finding out I've got ADHD has saved my life\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Charlie Jones Share Save\n\nDanny Kaan Joe Tracini has always struggled with his mental health but feels like he can finally look to the future after starting ADHD medication\n\nActor Joe Tracini has always felt uncomfortable in his own skin. Growing up in Great Yarmouth, as the son of comedian Joe Pasquale, he was self-conscious and prone to depressive thoughts. \"I told my first joke on stage at 18 months at one of my dad's gigs,\" he recalls. \"But a lot of my confidence growing up was a front.\" The only way he could engage with his peers was through his skill for magic tricks. He was relentlessly bullied at school. \"I was like a little old man. I used to speak like a grown-up. I wore three-piece suits and couldn't converse with other children,\" the 37-year-old says.\n\nGetty Joe Tracini was born as Joe Pasquale, the same name as his father, but he changed it aged 12\n\nAt the age of 11, he changed his surname from Pasquale to Tracini, after narrowly missing out on the role of Harry Potter to Daniel Radcliffe. \"I did six auditions for it. It was a big rejection but I don't think I would have survived making those films. The casting director sent me a letter which I've still got. \"I changed my name because I wanted to do things off my own back, I didn't want to have something to live up to. I love my dad very much and we have a good relationship but I wanted people to like me for me,\" he says. Tracini went to musical theatre college and secured various acting and TV presenting roles, including as a series regular on the soap Hollyoaks. But he turned to drink, drugs and self-harm as a way to quieten the negative voice in his head, that he calls \"Mick\". Tracini was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) a decade ago, which came as a huge relief. The diagnosis prompted him to kick his addictions. He has been sober for 10 years, after several trips to rehab. \"I felt less guilty because I knew the drink and drugs were a symptom of my BPD. I thought Mick would go away but the medication made me feel numb and changed my personality so I came off it,\" he says. During the pandemic, he gained tens of thousands of social media followers by posting comedy dance routines, dressed in a leotard. He also went viral for a video about his BPD, describing symptoms including mood swings, impulsiveness, paranoia, fear of abandonment and chronic feelings of emptiness.\n\nTracini has filmed several videos representing his BPD as two different people - himself and the negative voice inside his head, whom he calls Mick.\n\nBut around the same time, he stopped going to auditions and working because his mental health was so bad. \"I lost so many months where I felt paralysed by fear. I started writing a one-man show called 10 Things I Hate About Me, all about my life. \"But during that period I was so low and I was having so many panic attacks, I thought I'd never be able to perform it,\" he says. The turning point came last summer, when he decided to explore the possibility that he might have ADHD. Tracini looked through his list of followers on social media and found an ADHD psychiatrist who was able to diagnose him and prescribe medication. \"The drugs don't help with my BPD but I feel like I get to start again. It has cleared my brain and I can function again. I can work again and I can write. \"This time last year I thought 'this might be it. This might be who I am for the rest of my life'. \"I had no idea how life changing the diagnosis would be - people don't take ADHD seriously enough - finding out has saved my life.\"\n\nJoe has performed his one-man show in Edinburgh and is taking it on tour after rave reviews\n\nIn the summer, Tracini performed his one-man show to rave reviews at the Edinburgh Fringe. He is now taking it on his first ever tour, starting at the Norwich Theatre Playhouse, just up the road to where he grew up. Tracini spent so many years obsessing over the show that he felt he owed it to himself to perform it. \"Even if it had gone badly, I was doing myself a kindness to put it to rest and gain some closure,\" he says. \"It covers so many years of my life and so much stuff that I held on to that destroyed me. It's my past but it doesn't have to be a part of me any more.\" Mick will always be there, he believes, but he has learned to live with the voice inside his head. \"It has been like getting used to a flatmate. I hope he buggers off one day but we're doing OK. \"I was always living in the past and worrying about things I've done but now I'm looking to the future. I'm looking at weeks and months ahead, which is something Mick can't argue with.\" If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.",

      "content": "Researchers at UBC Okanagan have figured out how plants make mitraphylline, a rare natural substance that has drawn attention for its potential role in fighting cancer.\n\nMitraphylline is part of a small and unusual family of plant chemicals known as spirooxindole alkaloids. These molecules are defined by their distinctive twisted ring shapes, which help give them powerful biological effects, including anti tumor and anti inflammatory activity.\n\nFor years, scientists knew these compounds were valuable but had little understanding of how plants actually assembled them at the molecular level.\n\nSolving a Long Standing Biological Mystery\n\nProgress came in 2023, when a research team led by Dr. Thu-Thuy Dang in UBC Okanagan's Irving K. Barber Faculty of Science identified the first known plant enzyme capable of creating the signature spiro shape found in these molecules.\n\nBuilding on that discovery, doctoral student Tuan-Anh Nguyen led new work to pinpoint two key enzymes involved in making mitraphylline -- one enzyme that arranges the molecule into the correct three dimensional structure, and another that twists it into its final form.\n\n\"This is similar to finding the missing links in an assembly line,\" says Dr. Dang, UBC Okanagan Principal's Research Chair in Natural Products Biotechnology. \"It answers a long-standing question about how nature builds these complex molecules and gives us a new way to replicate that process.\"\n\nWhy Mitraphylline Is So Hard to Obtain\n\nMany promising natural compounds exist only in extremely small quantities within plants, making them expensive or impractical to produce using traditional laboratory methods. Mitraphylline is a prime example. It appears only in trace amounts in tropical trees such as Mitragyna (kratom) and Uncaria (cat's claw), both of which belong to the coffee plant family.\n\nBy identifying the enzymes that construct and shape mitraphylline, scientists now have a clear guide for recreating this process in more sustainable and scalable ways.\n\nToward Greener Drug Production\n\n\"With this discovery, we have a green chemistry approach to accessing compounds with enormous pharmaceutical value,\" says Nguyen. \"This is a result of UBC Okanagan's research environment, where students and faculty work closely to solve problems with global reach.\"\n\nNguyen also emphasized the personal impact of the work. \"Being part of the team that uncovered the enzymes behind spirooxindole compounds has been amazing,\" he says. \"UBC Okanagan's mentorship and support made this possible, and I'm excited to keep growing as a researcher here in Canada.\"\n\nGlobal Collaboration and Future Directions\n\nThe project was a collaborative effort between Dr. Dang's laboratory at UBC Okanagan and Dr. Satya Nadakuduti's team at the University of Florida.\n\nFunding came from several sources, including Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council's Alliance International Collaboration program, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and the Michael Smith Health Research BC Scholar Program. Additional support was provided by the United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture.\n\n\"We are proud of this discovery coming from UBC Okanagan. Plants are fantastic natural chemists,\" Dr. Dang says. \"Our next steps will focus on adapting their molecular tools to create a wider range of therapeutic compounds.\"",

      "title": "Stanford scientists uncover why mRNA COVID vaccines can trigger heart inflammation",
      "summary": "Stanford scientists have uncovered how mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can very rarely trigger heart inflammation in young men — and how that risk might be reduced. They found that the vaccines can spark a two-step immune reaction that floods the body with inflammatory signals, drawing aggressive immune cells into the heart and causing temporary injury.",
      "content": "Researchers at Stanford Medicine have identified the biological steps that explain how mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines can, in rare cases, lead to heart inflammation in some adolescent and young adult males. Their work also points to a potential strategy for lowering that risk.\n\nBy combining modern laboratory techniques with previously published data from vaccinated individuals, the team uncovered a two-stage immune response. In this process, the vaccine activates one type of immune cell, which then stimulates another. Together, these immune reactions drive inflammation that can damage heart muscle cells and set off additional inflammatory effects.\n\nVaccines Remain Highly Safe and Effective\n\nThe findings come despite the fact that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been given billions of times worldwide and continue to show an excellent safety record, said Joseph Wu, MD, PhD, director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute.\n\n\"The mRNA vaccines have done a tremendous job mitigating the COVID pandemic,\" said Wu, the Simon H. Stertzer, MD, Professor and a professor of medicine and of radiology. \"Without these vaccines, more people would have gotten sick, more people would have had severe effects and more people would have died.\"\n\nmRNA vaccines are considered a major advance because they can be developed quickly, adjusted as viruses change, and tailored to target very different pathogens. Still, as with any medical intervention, reactions are not identical for everyone.\n\nUnderstanding Vaccine-Associated Myocarditis\n\nOne uncommon but documented side effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is myocarditis, which refers to inflammation of the heart muscle. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and heart palpitations. These symptoms occur without a viral infection and typically appear within one to three days after vaccination.\n\nMost affected individuals show elevated levels of cardiac troponin in their blood, a widely used marker of heart muscle injury. (Cardiac troponin is normally found exclusively in the heart muscle. When found circulating in blood, it indicates damage to heart muscle cells.)\n\nThe condition occurs in roughly one out of every 140,000 people after a first vaccine dose and increases to about one in 32,000 after a second dose. Rates are highest among males age 30 and younger, where it affects about one in 16,750 vaccine recipients.\n\nOutcomes Are Usually Mild and Temporary\n\nWu emphasized that the majority of myocarditis cases linked to vaccination resolve quickly, with heart function either fully preserved or restored.\n\n\"It's not a heart attack in the traditional sense,\" he said. \"There's no blockage of blood vessels as found in most common heart attacks. When symptoms are mild and the inflammation hasn't caused structural damage to the heart, we just observe these patients to make sure they recover.\"\n\nIn rare instances, however, severe inflammation can cause serious injury, leading to hospitalization, intensive care treatment or death.\n\n\"But COVID's worse,\" Wu said. He noted that a COVID-19 infection is about 10 times more likely to cause myocarditis than an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to the many other risks posed by the disease.\n\nA Closer Look at the Immune Response\n\nWu is a senior author of the study, publisded Dec. 10 in Science Translational Medicine, along with Masataka Nishiga, MD, PhD, a former Stanford postdoctoral scholar now at The Ohio State University. The study's lead author is Xu Cao, PhD, also a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford.\n\n\"Medical scientists are quite aware that COVID itself can cause myocarditis,\" Wu said. \"To a lesser extent, so can the mRNA vaccines. The question is, why?\"\n\nSuspects Identified\n\nTo answer that question, the team analyzed blood samples from vaccinated individuals, including some who developed myocarditis. When they compared these samples with those from people who did not develop heart inflammation, two proteins stood out.\n\n\"Two proteins, named CXCL10 and IFN-gamma, popped up. We think these two are the major drivers of myocarditis,\" Wu said.\n\nBoth CXCL10 and IFN-gamma are cytokines, signaling molecules that immune cells use to communicate and coordinate their activity.\n\nHow Immune Cells Interact After Vaccination\n\nThe researchers grew human immune cells called macrophages in laboratory dishes and exposed them to mRNA vaccines. Macrophages act as early responders in immune defense.\n\nAfter exposure, the macrophages released multiple cytokines, with especially high levels of CXCL10. Their behavior closely matched immune responses previously documented in vaccinated people.\n\nWhen T cells were added to the system, either directly or by exposing them to fluid from the macrophage cultures, the T cells began producing large amounts of IFN-gamma. In contrast, T cells exposed to the vaccine alone did not show this spike. These findings showed that macrophages primarily produce CXCL10, while T cells are the main source of IFN-gamma following vaccination.\n\nHow the Cytokines Affect the Heart\n\nTo determine whether these cytokines directly harm the heart, the team vaccinated young male mice and observed increased cardiac troponin levels, indicating heart muscle injury.\n\nThey also found that immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, had entered heart tissue. Neutrophils are short-lived immune cells that respond aggressively to threats and are a major component of pus. Similar immune cell infiltration is seen in people who develop myocarditis after vaccination.\n\nBlocking CXCL10 and IFN-gamma reduced the number of these immune cells entering the heart and limited damage to healthy tissue.\n\nThe researchers also detected increased levels of adhesion molecules in heart blood vessels. These molecules help immune cells latch onto vessel walls, making it easier for them to move into heart tissue.\n\nTogether, these findings confirmed that CXCL10 and IFN-gamma directly contribute to heart injury. Blocking them preserved much of the immune response to vaccination while lowering signs of heart damage.\n\nTesting Human Heart Tissue Models\n\nWu's lab specializes in converting human skin or blood cells into stem-like cells that can become heart muscle cells, immune cells and blood vessel cells. These cells can be assembled into small, beating clusters that mimic aspects of heart function.\n\nWhen these cardiac spheroids were exposed to CXCL10 and IFN-gamma collected from vaccinated immune cells, markers of heart stress rose sharply. Using inhibitors to block the cytokines reduced this damage.\n\nMeasures of heart function, including contraction strength and beating rhythm, were impaired by the cytokines but improved once the signaling was blocked.\n\nSaved by a Soybean\n\nWu suspected that a widely available dietary compound might help protect the heart. Since myocarditis is more common in males and estrogen has anti-inflammatory effects, he revisited genistein, a soy-derived compound his team had studied previously.\n\nIn a 2022 study published in Cell, the researchers showed that genistein has anti-inflammatory properties and can counter marijuana-related damage to blood vessels and heart tissue.\n\n\"Genistein is only weakly absorbed when taken orally,\" Wu said. \"Nobody ever overdosed on tofu.\"\n\nTesting Genistein's Protective Effects\n\nThe team repeated their experiments while pre-treating cells, cardiac spheroids and mice (the latter by oral administration of large quantities) with genistein. This treatment reduced much of the heart damage caused by either mRNA vaccination or the CXCL10 and IFN-gamma combination.\n\nThe form of genistein used in the study was more purified and concentrated than supplements commonly sold in stores.\n\n\"It's reasonable to believe that the mRNA-vaccine-induced inflammatory response may extend to other organs,\" Wu said. \"We and others have seen some evidence of this in lung, liver and kidney. It's possible that genistein may also reverse these changes.\"\n\nBroader Implications Beyond COVID Vaccines\n\nHeightened cytokine signaling may be a broader feature of mRNA vaccines. IFN-gamma, in particular, plays a critical role in defending the body against foreign DNA and RNA, including viral genetic material.\n\n\"Your body needs these cytokines to ward off viruses. It's essential to immune response but can become toxic in large amounts,\" Wu said. Excessive IFN-gamma can lead to myocarditis-like symptoms and breakdown of heart muscle proteins.\n\nThis risk is not limited to COVID vaccines alone.\n\n\"Other vaccines can cause myocarditis and inflammatory problems, but the symptoms tend to be more diffuse,\" Wu said. \"Plus, mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines' risks have received intense public scrutiny and media coverage. If you get chest pains from a COVID vaccine you go to the hospital to get checked out, and if the serum troponin is positive, then you get diagnosed with myocarditis. If you get achy muscles or joints from a flu vaccine, you just blow it off.\"\n\nFunding and Support\n\nThe study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants R01 HL113006, R01 HL141371, R01 HL141851, R01 HL163680 and R01 HL176822) and the Gootter-Jensen Foundation.",

      "title": "Cancer cells depend on a dangerous DNA repair trick",
      "summary": "Researchers have discovered how cells activate a last-resort DNA repair system when severe damage strikes. When genetic tangles overwhelm normal repair pathways, cells flip on a fast but error-prone emergency fix that helps them survive. Some cancer cells rely heavily on this backup system, even though it makes their DNA more unstable. Blocking this process could expose a powerful new way to target tumors.",
      "content": "The DNA inside our cells is under constant attack. One of the most dangerous forms of damage is a double-strand break, which happens when both strands of the DNA helix are cut at the same time. Under normal conditions, healthy cells rely on highly accurate repair systems to fix this kind of damage. When those precise systems break down, however, cells may fall back on a less reliable emergency option. Researchers at Scripps Research have now identified when and how this backup repair process is triggered, and why some cancer cells depend on it to stay alive.\n\nTheir findings also suggest that this survival strategy could be turned against tumors that rely on it.\n\nRNA DNA Tangles That Threaten Genome Stability\n\nThe study, published in Cell Reports, examined a protein involved in untangling twisted genetic material. This includes structures known as R-loops, which are RNA-DNA tangles that can disrupt normal DNA function. These structures form when newly produced RNA fails to separate from the DNA strand it was copied from, leaving one side of the DNA exposed and vulnerable.\n\n\"R-loops are important for many different cell functions, but they must be tightly controlled,\" says senior author Xiaohua Wu, a professor at Scripps Research. \"If they aren't properly regulated, they can accumulate to harmful levels and cause genome instability.\"\n\nThe Role of SETX in Cancer and Neurological Disease\n\nThe researchers focused on a helicase protein, part of a group of molecular motors that unwind tangled genetic material, known as senataxin (SETX). Changes in the SETX gene are already linked to rare neurological disorders, including ataxia and a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The same mutations also appear in certain uterine, skin and breast cancers. This connection raised an important question. How do cancer cells cope with the stress caused by excessive R-loops when SETX is missing or defective?\n\nA Cellular Crisis Triggers Emergency Repair\n\nTo find answers, Wu's team studied cells lacking SETX that showed unusually high levels of R-loops. They then observed what happened when double-strand breaks formed at these tangled sites. As expected, the cells accumulated significant DNA damage. What surprised the researchers was how aggressively the cells responded.\n\n\"We were surprised but excited to find that the cell turns on an emergency DNA repair mechanism called break-induced replication (BIR),\" says Wu.\n\nBreak-Induced Replication as a Backup System\n\nUnder normal circumstances, BIR helps rescue stalled DNA replication forks. It can also act as a fallback repair option for double-strand breaks. Instead of making small, precise fixes, BIR copies long stretches of DNA to reconnect broken pieces. This rapid and extensive copying allows cells to survive severe damage, but it comes at a cost.\n\n\"It's like an emergency repair team that works intensively but makes more mistakes,\" says Wu.\n\nThe researchers discovered that without SETX, R-loops accumulate directly at sites of DNA breaks. This buildup interferes with the cell's usual repair signals. As a result, the broken DNA ends are trimmed excessively, exposing long sections of single-stranded DNA. These exposed regions attract the BIR machinery, including PIF1, a helicase that is essential for BIR to operate. Together, the exposed DNA and PIF1 act as a trigger that launches the BIR repair process.\n\nA Survival Advantage That Creates a Weakness\n\nAlthough BIR is prone to errors, it allows SETX-deficient cells to survive. Over time, however, these cells become dependent on BIR to repair DNA damage. If this repair route is blocked, the cells lose their ability to fix double-strand breaks and die. This type of vulnerability is known as synthetic lethality, a principle already used in several targeted cancer treatments.\n\nWu's team found that SETX-deficient cells are especially reliant on three BIR-related proteins: PIF1, RAD52 and XPF.\n\n\"What's important is that these aren't essential in normal cells, which means we could selectively kill SETX-deficient tumors,\" says Wu.\n\nFrom Discovery to Potential Therapy\n\nWhile the findings point to a promising strategy, Wu cautions that clinical applications will take time.\n\n\"We're now exploring ways to inhibit these BIR factors, trying to find ones with the right activity and low toxicity,\" she adds.\n\nThe team is also investigating which cancers accumulate the highest levels of R-loops and under what conditions. Identifying tumors most likely to respond to BIR-targeted therapies will be a key next step.\n\nAlthough SETX deficiency itself is relatively rare, many cancers build up R-loops through other pathways, including oncogene activation or hormone signaling such as estrogen in certain breast cancers. This means the approach could be relevant to a much broader range of tumors, not only those with SETX mutations.\n\nIn addition to Wu, authors of the study \"Break-induced replication is activated to repair R-loop-associated double-strand breaks in SETX-deficient cells\" include Tong Wu, Youhang Li, Yuqin Zhao and Sameer Bikram Shah of Scripps Research; and Linda Z. Shi of the University of California San Diego.\n\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants GM141868, CA294646, CA244912 and CA187052).",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Inside our cells, DNA can get damaged in many ways. One serious problem is when both strands of the DNA break at the same time, which can be very harmful. Normally, cells fix this damage using careful repair systems. But when these systems fail, cells switch to a faster, less accurate repair method.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Scripps Research studied how cells react when a protein called senataxin (SETX), which helps untangle DNA and RNA, is missing or broken. Without SETX, harmful tangles called R-loops build up and cause DNA breaks. The cells then activate a backup repair system called break-induced replication (BIR) that quickly copies large DNA sections to fix the breaks, even though it makes more mistakes.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows that some cancer cells rely heavily on this risky repair method to survive when SETX is not working. Because normal cells don’t depend on BIR as much, blocking this repair process could kill cancer cells without harming healthy cells. This offers a new way to target tumors that are hard to treat.\n\n**What's next step** – The scientists are now looking for safe drugs that can block the BIR repair system. They also want to find out which types of cancer have the most R-loops and would respond best to this treatment. This research could lead to new cancer therapies in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Researchers found that cancer cells use a risky DNA repair backup system to survive, revealing a new target for cancer treatment.",
