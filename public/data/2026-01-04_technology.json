      "title": "Beyond silicon: These shape-shifting molecules could be the future of AI hardware",
      "summary": "Scientists have developed molecular devices that can switch roles, behaving as memory, logic, or learning elements within the same structure. The breakthrough comes from precise chemical design that lets electrons and ions reorganize dynamically. Unlike conventional electronics, these devices do not just imitate intelligence but physically encode it. This approach could reshape how future AI hardware is built.",
      "content": "For more than 50 years, scientists have searched for alternatives to silicon as the foundation of electronic devices built from molecules. While the concept was appealing, practical progress proved far more difficult. Inside real devices, molecules do not behave like simple, isolated components. Instead, they interact intensely with one another as electrons move, ions shift, interfaces change, and even tiny differences in structure can trigger highly nonlinear responses. Although the potential of molecular electronics was clear, reliably predicting and controlling their behavior remained out of reach.\n\nAt the same time, neuromorphic computing, hardware inspired by the brain, has pursued a similar goal. The aim is to find a material that can store information, perform computation, and adapt within the same physical structure and do so in real time. However, today's leading neuromorphic systems, often based on oxide materials and filamentary switching, still function like carefully engineered machines that imitate learning rather than materials that naturally contain it.\n\nTwo Paths Begin to Converge\n\nA new study from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) suggests these two long-standing efforts may finally be coming together.\n\nIn a collaboration bringing together chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering, a team led by Sreetosh Goswami, Assistant Professor at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE), developed tiny molecular devices whose behavior can be tuned in multiple ways. Depending on how they are stimulated, the same device can act as a memory element, a logic gate, a selector, an analog processor, or an electronic synapse. \"It is rare to see adaptability at this level in electronic materials,\" says Sreetosh Goswami. \"Here, chemical design meets computation, not as an analogy, but as a working principle.\"\n\nHow Chemistry Enables Multiple Functions\n\nThis flexibility comes from the specific chemistry used to construct and adjust the devices. The researchers synthesized 17 carefully designed ruthenium complexes and studied how small changes in molecular shape and the surrounding ionic environment influence electron behavior. By adjusting the ligands and ions arranged around the ruthenium molecules, they demonstrated that a single device can display many different dynamic responses. These include shifts between digital and analog operation across a wide range of conductance values.\n\nThe molecular synthesis was carried out by Pradip Ghosh, Ramanujan Fellow, and Santi Prasad Rath, former PhD student at CeNSE. Device fabrication was led by Pallavi Gaur, first author and PhD student at CeNSE. \"What surprised me was how much versatility was hidden in the same system,\" says Gaur. \"With the right molecular chemistry and environment, a single device can store information, compute with it, or even learn and unlearn. That's not something you expect from solid-state electronics.\"\n\nA Theory That Explains and Predicts Behavior\n\nTo understand why these devices behave this way, the team needed something that has often been missing in molecular electronics: a solid theoretical framework. They developed a transport model based on many-body physics and quantum chemistry that can predict device behavior directly from molecular structure. Using this framework, the researchers traced how electrons move through the molecular film, how individual molecules undergo oxidation and reduction, and how counterions shift within the molecular matrix. Together, these processes determine switching behavior, relaxation dynamics, and the stability of each molecular state.\n\nToward Learning Built Into Materials\n\nThe key result is that the unusual adaptability of these complexes makes it possible to combine memory and computation within the same material. This opens the door to neuromorphic hardware in which learning is encoded directly into the material itself. The team is already working to integrate these molecular systems onto silicon chips, with the goal of creating future AI hardware that is both energy efficient and inherently intelligent.\n\n\"This work shows that chemistry can be an architect of computation, not just its supplier,\" says Sreebrata Goswami, Visiting Scientist at CeNSE and co-author on the study who led the chemical design.",

      "title": "Fossilized bones are revealing secrets from a lost world",
      "summary": "Researchers have uncovered thousands of preserved metabolic molecules inside fossilized bones millions of years old, offering a surprising new window into prehistoric life. The findings reveal animals’ diets, diseases, and even their surrounding climate, including evidence of warmer, wetter environments. One fossil even showed signs of a parasite still known today. This approach could transform how scientists reconstruct ancient ecosystems.",
      "content": "For the first time, researchers have successfully examined metabolism-related molecules preserved inside fossilized bones from animals that lived between 1.3 and 3 million years ago. These chemical traces offer rare insight into the animals themselves and the environments they once inhabited.\n\nBy analyzing metabolic signals tied to health and diet, the scientists were able to reconstruct details about ancient climates and landscapes, including temperature, soil conditions, rainfall, and vegetation. The results, published in Nature, point to environments that were significantly warmer and wetter than those found in the same regions today.\n\nStudying metabolites -- the molecules produced and used in digestion and other chemical processes in the body -- can reveal information about disease, nutrition, and environmental exposure. While metabolomics has become a powerful tool in modern medical research, it has rarely been applied to fossils. Instead, most studies of ancient remains rely on DNA, which mainly helps establish genetic relationships rather than day-to-day biology.\n\n\"I've always had an interest in metabolism, including the metabolic rate of bone, and wanted to know if it would be possible to apply metabolomics to fossils to study early life. It turns out that bone, including fossilized bone, is filled with metabolites,\" said Timothy Bromage, professor of molecular pathobiology at NYU College of Dentistry and affiliated professor in NYU's Department of Anthropology, who led the international research team.\n\nWhy Fossil Bones Can Preserve Chemistry\n\nIn recent years, scientists discovered that collagen -- the protein that provides structure to bones, skin, and connective tissues -- can survive in ancient bones, including dinosaur fossils.\n\n\"I thought, if collagen is preserved in a fossil bone, then maybe other biomolecules are protected in the bone microenvironment as well,\" said Bromage, who directs the Hard Tissue Research Unit at NYU College of Dentistry.\n\nBone surfaces are porous and filled with tiny blood vessel networks that exchange oxygen and nutrients with the bloodstream. Bromage proposed that during bone growth, metabolites circulating in blood could become trapped inside microscopic spaces within the bone, where they might remain protected for millions of years.\n\nTo test this idea, the team used mass spectrometry, a technique that converts molecules into charged particles for identification. Tests on modern mouse bones revealed nearly 2,200 metabolites. The same approach also allowed researchers to detect collagen proteins in some samples.\n\nTesting Fossils From Early Human Landscapes\n\nThe researchers then applied this method to fossilized animal bones dating from 1.3 million to 3 million years ago. These samples came from earlier excavations in Tanzania, Malawi, and South Africa, regions known for early human activity.\n\nThe fossils belonged to animals with modern relatives still living near those sites today. The team analyzed bones from rodents (mouse, ground squirrel, gerbil) as well as larger animals, including an antelope, a pig, and an elephant. Thousands of metabolites were identified, many of which closely matched those found in living species.\n\nHealth Diet and Disease Written in Bone\n\nMany of the detected metabolites reflected normal biological processes, such as the breakdown of amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Some chemical markers were linked to estrogen-related genes, indicating that certain fossilized animals were female.\n\nOther molecules revealed signs of illness. In one striking case, a ground squirrel bone from Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, dated to about 1.8 million years ago, showed evidence of infection by the parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans. The disease is caused by Trypanosoma brucei and spread by tsetse flies.\n\n\"What we discovered in the bone of the squirrel is a metabolite that is unique to the biology of that parasite, which releases the metabolite into the bloodstream of its host. We also saw the squirrel's metabolomic anti-inflammatory response, presumably due to the parasite,\" said Bromage.\n\nTracing Ancient Diets and Environments\n\nThe chemical evidence also revealed what plants the animals consumed. Although plant metabolite databases are far less complete than those for animals, the researchers identified compounds linked to regional plants such as aloe and asparagus.\n\n\"What that means is that, in the case of the squirrel, it nibbled on aloe and took those metabolites into its own bloodstream,\" explained Bromage. \"Because the environmental conditions of aloe are very specific, we now know more about the temperature, rainfall, soil conditions, and tree canopy, essentially reconstructing the squirrel's environment. We can build a story around each of the animals.\"\n\nThese reconstructed habitats align with previous geological and ecological research. For example, Olduvai Gorge Bed in Tanzania has been described as freshwater woodland and grassland, while the Upper Bed reflects drier woodlands and marshy areas. Across all studied locations, the fossil evidence consistently points to climates that were wetter and warmer than today.\n\n\"Using metabolic analyses to study fossils may enable us to reconstruct the environment of the prehistoric world with a new level of detail, as though we were field ecologists in a natural environment today,\" said Bromage.\n\nResearch Team and Support\n\nAdditional study authors include Bin Hu, Sher Poudel, Sasan Rabieh, and Shoshana Yakar of NYU College of Dentistry; Thomas Neubert, Christopher Lawrence de Jesus, and Hediye Erdjument-Bromage of NYU Grossman School of Medicine; along with collaborators from institutions in France, Germany, Canada, and the United States. The research was supported by The Leakey Foundation, with additional support for the scanning electron microscope provided by the National Institutes of Health (S10 OD023659 and S10 RR027990).",
