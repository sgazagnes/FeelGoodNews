      "title": "MIT's new brain tool could finally explain consciousness",
      "summary": "Scientists still don’t know how the brain turns physical activity into thoughts, feelings, and awareness—but a powerful new tool may help crack the mystery. Researchers at MIT are exploring transcranial focused ultrasound, a noninvasive technology that can precisely stimulate deep regions of the brain that were previously off-limits. In a new “roadmap” paper, they explain how this method could finally let scientists test cause-and-effect in consciousness research, not just observe correlations.",
      "content": "Consciousness has long been described as one of science's toughest puzzles. Researchers still do not fully understand how physical brain tissue gives rise to thoughts, emotions, and subjective experience. A relatively new technology, known as transcranial focused ultrasound, may offer a powerful way to investigate this mystery more directly.\n\nAlthough the technology has been around for several years, it has not yet become a standard tool in neuroscience research. Now, two researchers at MIT are preparing new experiments using the technique and have published a paper that serves as a detailed guide, or \"roadmap,\" for applying it to the study of consciousness.\n\n\"Transcranial focused ultrasound will let you stimulate different parts of the brain in healthy subjects, in ways you just couldn't before,\" says Daniel Freeman, an MIT researcher and co-author of the paper. \"This is a tool that's not just useful for medicine or even basic science, but could also help address the hard problem of consciousness. It can probe where in the brain are the neural circuits that generate a sense of pain, a sense of vision, or even something as complex as human thought.\"\n\nUnlike other brain stimulation methods, transcranial focused ultrasound does not require surgery. It can reach deeper areas of the brain with greater precision than techniques such as transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation.\n\n\"There are very few reliable ways of manipulating brain activity that are safe but also work,\" says Matthias Michel, an MIT philosopher who studies consciousness and co-authored the paper.\n\nThe study, titled \"Transcranial focused ultrasound for identifying the neural substrate of conscious perception,\" appears in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews. In addition to Freeman and Michel, the authors include Brian Odegaard, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Florida, and Seung-Schik Yoo, an associate professor of radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nWhy Studying the Brain Is So Challenging\n\nUnderstanding the human brain is particularly difficult because researchers typically cannot experiment on healthy people in invasive ways. Outside of neurosurgery, scientists have limited options for exploring deep brain structures. Imaging tools such as MRIs and various forms of ultrasound can show anatomy, while the electroencephalogram (EEG) records electrical signals across the brain. However, these methods mainly observe activity rather than directly influencing it.\n\nTranscranial focused ultrasound works differently. It sends acoustic waves through the skull and concentrates them on a precise target, sometimes only a few millimeters wide. This allows researchers to stimulate specific brain regions and observe the effects, making it a promising tool for carefully controlled experiments.\n\n\"It truly is the first time in history that one can modulate activity deep in the brain, centimeters from the scalp, examining subcortical structures with high spatial resolution,\" Freeman says. \"There's a lot of interesting emotional circuits that are deep in the brain, but until now you couldn't manipulate them outside of the operating room.\"\n\nTesting Cause and Effect in Consciousness\n\nOne of the most important advantages of this technology is its ability to help identify cause-and-effect relationships in the brain. Many current studies of consciousness rely on observing brain activity while people process visual stumuli or perform tasks linked to awareness. While these studies reveal correlations, they do not always show whether a brain signal creates a conscious experience or simply follows it.\n\nBy actively changing brain activity, transcranial focused ultrasound may help researchers determine which neural processes are essential for consciousness and which are secondary effects.\n\n\"Transcranial focused ultrasound gives us a solution to that problem,\" Michel says.\n\nCompeting Ideas About How Consciousness Works\n\nIn their paper, the researchers outline how the technology could be used to test two broad theories of consciousness. One view, known as the cognitivist approach, argues that conscious experience depends on higher-level mental processes such as reasoning, reflection, and the integration of information across the brain. This perspective often emphasizes the role of the frontal cortex.\n\nThe alternative view, sometimes called the non-cognitivist approach, suggests that consciousness does not require complex cognitive machinery. Instead, specific patterns of brain activity may directly produce particular experiences. From this perspective, consciousness might arise in more localized brain regions, including areas toward the back of the cortex or deeper subcortical structures.\n\nThe researchers propose using focused ultrasound to explore questions such as the role of the prefrontal cortex in perception, whether awareness depends on local brain activity or large-scale networks, how separate brain regions combine information into a single experience, and what part subcortical structures play in conscious awareness.\n\nWhat Pain and Vision Can Reveal\n\nExperiments using visual stimuli could help identify which brain regions are required for conscious perception. Similar approaches could also be applied to pain, another fundamental component of conscious experience. For example, people often pull their hand away from a hot surface before they consciously feel pain. This raises questions about where and how the sensation of pain is actually generated.\n\n\"It's a basic science question, how is pain generated in the brain,\" Freeman says. \"And it's surprising there is such uncertainty … Pain could stem from cortical areas, or it could be deeper brain structures. I'm interested in therapies, but I'm also curious if subcortical structures may play a bigger role than appreciated. It could be the physical manifestation of pain is subcortical. That's a hypothesis. But now we have a tool to examine it.\"\n\nExperiments and Growing Interest at MIT\n\nFreeman and Michel are not only outlining ideas for future research. They are actively planning experiments that will begin with stimulation of the visual cortex and later move to higher-level regions in the frontal cortex. While tools like EEG can show when neurons respond to visual input, these new studies aim to establish a clearer link between brain activity and what a person actually experiences.\n\n\"It's one thing to say if these neurons reponded electrically. It's another thing to say if a person saw light,\" Freeman says.\n\nMichel is also helping build a broader research community around consciousness at MIT. Along with Earl Miller, the Picower Professor of Neuroscience in MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, he co-founded the MIT Consciousness Club. The group brings together scholars from multiple disciplines and hosts monthly events focused on advances in consciousness research.\n\nThe MIT Consciousness Club receives partial support from MITHIC, the MIT Human Insight Collaborative, an initiative backed by the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.\n\nFor Michel, transcranial focused ultrasound represents a promising direction for the field.\n\n\"It's a new tool, so we don't really know to what extent it's going to work,\" he says. \"But I feel there's low risk and high reward. Why wouldn't you take this path?\"\n\nThe research described in the paper was supported by the U.S. Department of the Air Force.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long struggled to understand how the brain produces thoughts, feelings, and awareness. Most brain research methods can only observe brain activity but cannot safely stimulate deep brain areas in healthy people to study cause and effect.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at MIT introduced a new tool called transcranial focused ultrasound. This technology uses sound waves to target and stimulate precise deep parts of the brain without surgery. In a recent paper, MIT scientists explained how this tool can be used to study consciousness by actively changing brain activity, not just watching it.\n\n**Impact** – This method is unique because it can reach brain regions that were previously unreachable without invasive surgery. It allows scientists to test which brain areas actually produce conscious experiences, like pain or vision, rather than just being linked to them. This could clarify how different parts of the brain work together to create awareness and thoughts.\n\n**What's next step** – The MIT team is planning experiments starting with the visual part of the brain and moving to more complex regions involved in thinking. They will test different ideas about how consciousness works by stimulating brain areas and observing changes in experience.

      "title": "The genetic turning point that made backbones possible",
      "summary": "Scientists have uncovered a surprising genetic shift that may explain how animals with backbones—from fish and frogs to humans—became so complex. By comparing sea squirts, lampreys, and frogs, researchers found that key genes controlling cell communication began producing many more protein variations right at the moment vertebrates emerged. This genetic flexibility likely helped cells specialize in new ways, shaping the development of diverse tissues and organs.",
      "content": "Scientists at the University of St Andrews have identified an important missing piece in understanding how animals with backbones first evolved. This includes mammals, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. The findings help explain how vertebrates emerged and diversified from simpler animal ancestors.\n\nThe research was published February 2 in the journal BMC Biology. In the study, researchers uncovered an unusual pattern in the way certain genes evolved, suggesting these changes played a key role in the early development and expansion of vertebrate life.\n\nHow Cells Communicate During Development\n\nAll animals rely on complex signaling pathways that allow cells to communicate with one another. These pathways guide critical processes such as embryo formation and organ development. They are essential to normal growth and are also closely linked to disease when mutations occur, which is why they are frequent targets in drug development.\n\nAt the core of these pathways are specialized proteins that determine how signals are interpreted inside cells. These proteins act as control points, steering cells toward specific behaviors and patterns of gene activity.\n\nComparing Sea Squirts, Lampreys, and Frogs\n\nTo better understand how these systems evolved, the researchers generated new genetic data from sea squirts, a lamprey, and a species of frog. Sea squirts are invertebrates, making them useful for identifying differences between animals without backbones and those with them. Lampreys represent one of the earliest branches of vertebrates, helping researchers pinpoint when key genetic changes first appeared.\n\nThe team found that genes responsible for producing signaling output proteins evolved in a distinctive way during the shift from invertebrates to vertebrates.\n\nA First Look Using Long-Molecule DNA Sequencing\n\nThe study relied on long-molecule DNA sequencing, a technique that makes it possible to separate and identify different transcripts produced by a single gene. This approach had never before been applied to the genes expressed in these particular animals.\n\nAs a result, researchers were able to map the full range of transcripts and proteins generated by these genes during vertebrate development for the first time.\n\nA Surge in Protein Diversity\n\nUnlike the sea squirt, both the lamprey and the frog produced many more versions of proteins from individual signaling output genes. This increase was far greater than what was seen for most other gene types.\n\nThe scale of this shift stood out clearly. Because these signaling pathways influence how cells become different tissues and organs, the researchers believe the expanded protein diversity likely contributed to the increased complexity seen in vertebrates (animals with backbones) compared with invertebrates.\n\nWhy These Findings Matter\n\nLead author Professor David Ferrier from the School of Biology said: \"It was very surprising to us to see how this small selection of very particular genes stands out in the way that they are behaving compared to any other sort of gene we looked at.It will be exciting to determine how these various different protein forms work in distinct ways to generate the diversity of cell types we now see in vertebrates.\"\n\nBeyond offering insight into how vertebrates evolved, these protein variations could also prove valuable for future research. Understanding how these pathways function and can be adjusted may eventually help scientists develop new approaches for managing disease.",

      "content": "An antibody that has the power to neutralise any influenza strain could be widely administered in the form of a nasal spray if a flu pandemic emerges\n\nNasal sprays target flu viruses at their main point of entry into the body Tatiana Maksimova/Getty Images\n\nAn antibody nasal spray has shown promise for protecting against flu in preliminary human trials, after first being validated in mice and monkeys. It may be useful for combatting future flu pandemics because it seems to neutralise any kind of influenza virus, including ones that spill over from non-human animals.\n\nThe main tool we have for stopping the spread of flu is the annual vaccine, which stimulates our immune system to make antibodies against recently circulating strains of influenza virus. However, because influenza strains are constantly morphing, vaccines are only moderately effective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo address this, pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson developed a special antibody called CR9114 that can neutralise any of these strains. It does this by recognising and binding to a part of the virus that always stays the same, regardless of how other parts of it are changing.\n\nWhen CR9114 was initially injected into animals’ bloodstreams, it failed to provide robust protection against flu. This was because only a small proportion reached the nose, the main point of entry for influenza viruses. In 2022, the firm Leyden Labs licensed CR9114 and developed a formulation that could be sprayed up the nose instead.\n\nSince then, the company has shown that spraying CR9114 up the noses of mice and macaques stops them from getting sick when they are exposed to various strains of influenza A and B, including one collected from a scientist’s throat during a bad flu season in 1933.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nPreliminary tests were also conducted in 143 people aged 18 to 55. Researchers found that administering the spray twice a day maintained steady levels of the antibody inside participants’ noses and didn’t cause any major side-effects. Samples of their nasal mucus collected afterwards also neutralised a range of influenza strains, including a bird flu strain that crossed into people in China in 2013.\n\nThe next step will be to directly expose people who have used the spray to a range of influenza viruses to confirm that it actually stops them from getting sick.\n\nThe spray may not be 100 per cent effective because the virus can enter the body via routes other than the nose, like the mouth, says Linda Wakim at the University of Melbourne, Australia. “But nonetheless, blocking nasal entry would still intercept the virus at a major access point for infection.”\n\nIt will probably also be less convenient than the flu vaccine because it requires twice-daily administration rather than a single jab, says Wakim. “However, it could be a game changer for specific high-risk groups, such as immunocompromised individuals, frontline healthcare workers, or during a pandemic situation where rapid, short-term population protection is needed while vaccines are being developed or rolled out.”",
