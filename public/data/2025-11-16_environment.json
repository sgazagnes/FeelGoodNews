      "title": "Floating device turns raindrops into electricity",
      "summary": "A new floating droplet electricity generator is redefining how rain can be harvested as a clean power source by using water itself as both structural support and an electrode. This nature-integrated design dramatically reduces weight and cost compared to traditional solid-based generators while still producing high-voltage outputs from each falling drop. It remains stable in harsh natural conditions, scales to large functional devices, and has the potential to power sensors, off-grid electronics, and distributed energy systems on lakes and coastal waters.",
      "content": "Raindrops are more than a source of fresh water. They also carry mechanical energy that reaches the ground for free, and scientists have been exploring how to turn that energy into electricity for years. Traditional droplet electricity generators, however, often struggle with low efficiency, heavy components, and limited potential for scaling up. A research team from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics has now developed a new solution: a floating droplet electricity generator that uses natural water as part of its structure. The result is a lighter, more affordable, and more sustainable way to collect clean energy. The work is described in National Science Review.\n\nMost droplet electricity generators use a solid platform and a metal bottom electrode. When a raindrop hits the dielectric film on top, the impact produces an electrical signal. Although this approach can generate hundreds of volts, it relies on rigid, costly materials that limit widespread deployment. The new design takes a different approach by allowing the device to float on a water surface. In this setup, the water itself acts as the supporting base and also serves as the conductive electrode. This nature-integrated configuration cuts the device's weight by about 80 percent and lowers cost by about 50 percent while maintaining similar electrical output compared to conventional systems.\n\nHow Water Improves Energy Generation\n\nWhen a raindrop lands on the floating dielectric film, the water beneath it provides the strength needed to absorb the impact because of its incompressibility and surface tension. This lets the droplet spread more effectively across the surface. At the same time, ions in the water act as charge carriers, allowing the water layer to operate as a dependable electrode. These combined effects enable the floating generator to deliver high peak voltages of around 250 volts per droplet, a performance level comparable to devices that rely on metal components and solid substrates.\n\nDurability is a major advantage of the new system. Tests showed that the W-DEG continued to function under a wide range of temperatures and salt levels, and even when exposed to natural lake water containing biofouling. Many energy-harvesting devices degrade in such environments, but this generator remained stable because its dielectric layer is chemically inert and its water-based structure is naturally resilient. To improve reliability further, the team used water's strong surface tension to design drainage holes that let water move downward but not upward. This creates a self-regulating way to remove excess droplets and helps prevent water buildup that could interfere with performance.\n\nScalable Design for Large-Area Energy Collection\n\nScalability is a promising aspect of this technology. The researchers created an integrated device measuring 0.3 square meters, which is much larger than most previous droplet generators, and demonstrated that it could power 50 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at the same time. The system also charged capacitors to useful voltages within minutes, showing its potential for powering small electronics and wireless sensors. With continued development, similar systems could be deployed on lakes, reservoirs, or coastal waters, providing renewable electricity without using any land-based space.\n\n\"By letting water itself play both structural and electrical roles, we've unlocked a new strategy for droplet electricity generation that is lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable,\" said Prof. Wanlin Guo, a corresponding author of the study. \"This opens the door to land-free hydrovoltaic systems that can complement other renewable technologies like solar and wind.\"\n\nBroader Applications and Future Possibilities\n\nThe impact of this research goes beyond capturing energy from rainfall. Because the generator floats naturally on water, it could support environmental monitoring systems in diverse aquatic settings, including sensors for water quality, salinity, or pollution. In areas with frequent rain, the technology could offer a distributed source of clean power for local grids or act as a resource for off-grid needs. The \"nature-integrated design\" approach, which uses abundant natural materials like water as essential working components, may also inspire future advances in sustainable technology.\n\nAlthough the laboratory results are encouraging, the researchers emphasize that additional work is necessary before the technology can be deployed at large scales. Real raindrops vary in both size and speed, and these differences could influence power generation. Maintaining the durability of large dielectric films in dynamic outdoor conditions will also require further engineering. Even so, the successful demonstration of a stable, efficient, and scalable prototype represents an important step toward practical applications.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long tried to capture the energy from raindrops to create electricity, but existing devices are often heavy, costly, and hard to scale up. Traditional generators use solid materials that limit their size and use.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Nanjing University developed a new floating droplet electricity generator that uses natural water as both its support and electrode. This device floats on water surfaces like lakes and uses water’s properties to generate about 250 volts each time a raindrop hits it. It weighs 80% less and costs 50% less than older models but still produces similar electric power. The team also built a larger version that powered 50 small lights, showing it can work on a bigger scale.\n\n**Impact** – This floating design is unique because it uses water itself to help make electricity, making the device lighter, cheaper, and more durable. It works well even in salty or natural lake water and resists damage from dirt and temperature changes. This means it could be placed on lakes or coastal waters without taking up land space, and could power small electronics or sensors in remote areas.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers plan to improve the device’s durability and test it with real rain, which varies in drop size and speed. They also want to make larger versions for practical use.

      "title": "Couple among first to use data centre to heat home say bills dropped to £40",
      "summary": "\"It's fantastic because it's eco-friendly...We're not burning any gases,\" says Terrence Bridges.",
      "content": "Couple among first to use data centre to heat home say bills dropped to £40\n\n1 hour ago Share Save Ben Schofield BBC East, political correspondent Share Save\n\nBen Schofield/BBC Terrence Bridges says he \"can't fault the heating system\", which captures heat from more than 500 mini-computers processing data\n\nAn Essex couple have become the first people in the country to trial a scheme that sees them heat their home using a data centre in their garden shed. Terrence and Lesley Bridges have seen their energy bills drop dramatically, from £375 a month down to as low as £40, since they swapped their gas boiler for a HeatHub – a small data centre containing more than 500 computers. Data centres are banks of computers which carry out digital tasks. As the computers process data, they generate lots of heat, which is captured by oil and then transferred into the Bridges' hot water system. Mr Bridges, 76, says keeping his two-bed bungalow near Braintree warm was a necessity as his wife has spinal stenosis and is in \"a lot of pain\" when it gets colder. \"It truly is brilliant,\" Mr Bridges continues. \"I'm over the moon that we got picked to trial this out. You can't fault the heating system – it is a 100% improvement on what we had before.\" \"You don't need to go to a sauna after coming here,\" Mrs Bridges, 75, adds. The HeatHub was developed by Thermify and is part of UK Power Networks' SHIELD project, which aims to come up with innovative ways for low-income households to transition to net zero. Through SHIELD, the Bridges also had solar panels and a battery put in, which have contributed to their savings.\n\nBen Schofield/BBC Terrence and his wife Lesley have lived in their house for three years\n\nMr Bridges, a retired RAF sergeant, says despite putting \"the heating up fairly high to keep it nice and warm\", his bill has fallen to between £40 and £60 each month. \"I think it's fantastic because it's eco-friendly,\" he continues, \"we're not burning any gases, so it's green – it's environmentally friendly.\"\n\nBen Schofield/BBC The Bridges' shed also contains an inverter for solar panels, a battery to store electricity and a heat battery connected to the Thermify HeatHub\n\nThermify co-founder and CEO Travis Theune says the Bridges' HeatHub will eventually be part of a \"remote and distributed\" data centre, involving many units processing data for customers. While not designed for the heavy processing needed for artificial intelligence, Mr Theune says the system could run things like apps or analyse large volumes of data. He says the company wanted to design a system to provide both \"clean\" and \"affordable\" energy because \"finding a way to do both was a hard problem\". The project is still in the pilot phase, but in the future, clients will pay Thermify to process their data using the HeatHubs. Mr Theune adds the system provides \"clean, green heat at a low-to-no price point\" because \"the electricity that's generating that heat is paid for by somebody else\".\n\nBen Schofield/BBC Each module contains up to 56 Raspberry Pi computers, which are each about the size of a matchbox, says Thermify CEO Travis Theune\n\nThe Bridges' landlord, social housing provider Eastlight Community Homes, is also part of SHIELD. Daniel Greenwood, Eastlight's head of asset management, says he hopes the next phase of the project will see 50 homes get HeatHubs, and adds: \"We've seen great results for the current installation, and although this is the first of its kind, we're looking to roll that out more broadly.\" Jack McKellar, UK Power Networks’ innovation programme manager, says: \"We don't want anyone to miss out on the benefits of new and emerging technologies, as the UK moves towards a greener future.\"\n\nBen Schofield/BBC Daniel Greenwood from Eastlight Community Homes hopes 50 HeatHubs will be installed in 50 homes\n\nData centres help run the modern world. It is estimated they consume about 2.5% of the UK's electricity, and as more are built, their power demand could rise fourfold by 2030. Thermify is not alone in trying to capture and use the heat generated by data centres. A swimming pool in Devon is being warmed by a washing machine-sized \"digital boiler\". The company behind that scheme is also involved in a proposal to build the Melbourn Energy Superloop – a combined solar-powered data centre and district heat network in south Cambridgeshire. Milton Keynes University Hospital was also hoping to be the first place in the city to benefit from £95m plans to share heat from a new data centre.\n\nBen Schofield/BBC Mike Richardson says relying on \"nature\" to help run his data centre involved \"challenges\"\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, data centres use up to 30% of their electricity consumption on cooling. Mike Richardson, the 66-year-old founder and owner of DSM, says he had tried to incorporate \"nature\" as much as possible into his data centre at a former RAF base just off the A1 near Peterborough. A 200kW array of solar panels helps power it, and a 500 cubic-metre artificial lake cools it down. The lake is filled with water collected from the roof of an old aircraft hangar and pumped from two boreholes. Four heat exchangers are submerged in the 1.7 metre deep water, which is also home to dozens of koi carp and tench – fish that have their own role in the operation. \"We need to keep the pipes clean, and they eat the algae,\" Mr Richardson tells the BBC. With a 400kW capacity, the data centre is relatively small – or \"boutique\", according to Mr Richardson.\n\nBen Schofield/BBC The blue pipe brings chilled water into the data racks from the heat exchangers outside in the lake, while the red pipe takes water warmed by the computer servers back out\n\nWarm water is pumped from data racks to heat exchangers in the lake, then the cooled water is sent back inside, in a closed loop. Traditional cooling systems often rely on compressing a chemical coolant, which can be toxic. \"Keeping away from chemicals is an important thing for us,\" Mr Richardson says. He adds that because there was no need for compression, the setup used much less electricity for cooling.\n\nBen Schofield/BBC Thermometers show the temperature of the water going into the data centre (top left) and coming back out (top right), before it heads to the heat exchange in the lake\n\nDoes it work? \"Yes, it works – it most definitely works,\" Mr Richardson says. But adds that relying on nature comes with \"challenges\" because \"nature by default is not something which is, you know, stable\". \"It takes a bit of management, but it's all doable,\" he continues. The system, while small-scale, can be scaled up with a larger body of water, he explains. \"Water is one of the best mediums for heat transfer,\" he says.",

      "summary": "Scientists uncovered Australia’s oldest known crocodile eggshells, revealing the secret lives of ancient mekosuchine crocodiles that once dominated inland ecosystems. These crocs filled surprising niches, including terrestrial stalking and possibly tree-dropping ambushes.",
      "content": "The oldest known crocodile eggshells ever identified in Australia are giving UNSW researchers fresh insight into long vanished animals and the environments they depended on. These remains come from creatures that lived millions of years before the continent separated from the landmasses that became Antarctica and South America.\n\nIn the small southeast QLD town of Murgon, scientists have spent decades excavating what appears to be an ordinary clay pit in a local grazier's backyard. Beneath the surface sits one of Australia's earliest fossil-bearing locations, a site that provides a rare look into a time when the continent was still part of a much larger supercontinent.\n\nAn international research group led by the Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont (ICP), working with UNSW Sydney, has now identified these ancient crocodilian eggshells. The team confirmed they are the oldest ever recovered in Australia.\n\nThe fragments have been formally named Wakkaoolithus godthelpi. They once came from mekosuchine crocodiles, an extinct group that dominated waterways about 55 million years ago. Australia's modern freshwater and saltwater crocodiles only appeared far later, roughly 3.8 million years ago.\n\n\"These eggshells have given us a glimpse of the intimate life history of mekosuchines,\" says the study's, opens in a new window lead author Xavier Panadès i Blas. \"We can now investigate not only the strange anatomy of these crocs, but also how they reproduced and adapted to changing environments.\"\n\nUnusual Behaviors in Ancient Mekosuchine Crocodiles\n\nUnlike today's crocodiles, mekosuchines occupied a surprising range of ecological roles.\n\n\"It's a bizarre idea,\" says UNSW paleontologist Professor Michael Archer. \"But some of them appear to have been terrestrial hunters in the forests.\"\n\nEvidence from younger mekosuchine fossils supports this interpretation. These fossils were found in 25-million-year-old deposits at the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in Boodjamulla National Park on Waanyi country in northwestern QLD.\n\nSome river-dwelling species at Riversleigh reached lengths of at least five meters. Prof. Archer says some were likely semi-arboreal as well.\n\n\"Some were also apparently at least partly semi-arboreal 'drop crocs',\" he says. \"They were perhaps hunting like leopards -- dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner.\"\n\nEggshells as a Tool for Reconstructing Ancient Environments\n\nPanadès i Blas highlights the scientific value of eggshells in reconstructing ancient life.\n\n\"They preserve microstructural and geochemical signals that tell us not only what kinds of animals laid them, but also where they nested and how they bred,\" he says. \"Our study shows just how powerful these fragments can be. Eggshells should be a routine, standard component of paleontological research -- collected, curated and analyzed alongside bones and teeth.\"\n\nThe Murgon samples were studied using both optical and electron microscopes. The eggshell microstructure indicates that these crocodiles likely nested along the edges of a lake and adjusted their reproductive strategies as conditions shifted over time.\n\nCoauthor Dr. Michael Stein suggests that mekosuchines may have lost much of their inland habitat as the region dried. They would have been pushed into smaller waterways, where they had to compete with newly arrived crocodiles as well as cope with shrinking populations of their megafaunal prey.\n\nDr. Stein adds that the lake at Murgon was surrounded by dense forest.\n\n\"This forest was also home to the world's oldest-known songbirds, Australia's earliest frogs and snakes, a wide range of small mammals with South American links, as well as one of the world's oldest known bats,\" he says.\n\nA Fossil Site That Continues to Reshape Australia's Early History\n\nProf. Archer describes the Tingamarra deposit at Murgon as part of a far larger scientific story, revealing details about life before Australia became isolated.\n\nHe recalls uncovering an unusual crocodilian jaw fragment in 1975 in the Texas Caves of southeastern Queensland. Although it is now known to belong to a mekosuchine crocodile, the specimen initially confused him.\n\nThe jawbone looked reptilian but had teeth resembling those of dinosaurs. Seeking clarity, he brought the fossil to Professor Max Hecht, a reptile expert at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\n\"When he saw it, Max nearly dropped his coffee cup,\" Prof. Archer says. \"It closely resembled another kind of extinct croc with dinosaur-type teeth that had been found in South America. That was the first realization that crocodiles with teeth like this were also part of the older record in Australia.\"\n\nProf. Archer notes that he and his team have been working in Murgon since 1983, often literally digging in the backyard of enthusiastic residents.\n\n\"That year, UNSW colleague Henk Godhelp and I drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard,\" he says.\n\nAfter explaining the potential prehistoric material beneath the sheep paddock and mentioning that fossil turtle shells had already been found nearby, the property owners eagerly agreed.\n\n\"From subsequent excavations, that's where the eggshell pieces came from. And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we've already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come.\"\n\nHow Fossils Help Guide Modern Conservation\n\nFor Prof. Archer, these discoveries serve a dual purpose. They illuminate Australia's ancient past -- and they can also inform strategies to protect vulnerable species facing rapid environmental change today.\n\nHe has been part of a multi-institutional effort known as the 'Burramys Project', which aims to rescue the Mountain Pygmy-possum (Burramys parvus) from the brink of extinction.\n\nThis alpine species is under severe pressure from climate change. The team found that its ancient relatives thrived for nearly 25 million years in lowland temperate rainforests, including those that once covered the Riversleigh region between 25 and 12 million years ago.\n\nFrom this evidence, researchers concluded that the ancestors of modern Mountain Pygmy-possums probably followed rainforest habitats uphill during a warm and wet phase in the Pleistocene Epoch. When the alpine climate eventually cooled, the species developed survival strategies such as hibernation.\n\nA few years ago, Prof. Archer's group collaborated with Trevor Evans of Secret Creek Sanctuary and received support from multiple organizations, including the Prague Zoo in the Czech Republic, to establish a breeding program in non-alpine rainforest near Lithgow.\n\nToday, the Mountain Pygmy-possum population is thriving in that environment -- consistent with predictions drawn from the fossil record.\n\nAs climate change threatens more species, Prof. Archer says these findings show that not every story ends in decline.\n\n\"The Burramys Project is a demonstration that, at least in some cases, we can develop strategies to save endangered species,\" he says. \"Clues from fossil records matter,\" he says. \"Not just to understand the past, but also to help secure the future.\"\n\nThe newly named croc species, Wakkaoolithus godthelpi, honors the Wakka Wakka First Nations people whose Country includes the fossil site. The name also recognizes Henk Godthelp, a longtime member of the UNSW paleontology team alongside Prof. Archer, Professor Sue Hand and many other researchers and students.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have found Australia’s oldest crocodile eggshells in a small town called Murgon, Queensland. These fossils come from a time 55 million years ago, when Australia was still connected to Antarctica and South America as part of a supercontinent.\n\n**What happened** – A team from UNSW Sydney and the Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont studied tiny eggshell fragments named Wakkaoolithus godthelpi. These belonged to mekosuchine crocodiles, an extinct group that lived long before today’s crocodiles appeared. The fossils show that some of these ancient crocs were unusual hunters, possibly stalking on land or even dropping from trees to catch prey.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery changes what we know about crocodile behavior and ancient ecosystems. Unlike modern crocodiles that mostly live in water, mekosuchines filled different roles, including living in forests and hunting on land or from trees. The eggshells also help scientists learn where these crocs nested and how they adapted to changing environments millions of years ago.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers plan to keep digging at Murgon, expecting to find more fossils that will reveal further details about Australia’s ancient animals and climate.

      "content": "Set to launch no earlier than Nov. 16, Sentinel-6B will continue the data record now being collected by its twin satellite Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, which lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in November 2020 aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket shown here. SpaceX\n\nSet to track sea levels across more than 90% of Earth’s ocean, the mission must first get into orbit. Here’s what to expect.\n\nSentinel-6B, an ocean-tracking satellite jointly developed by NASA and ESA (European Space Agency), is ready to roll out to the launch pad, packed into the payload fairing of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nLaunch is targeted at 12:21 a.m. EST, Monday, Nov. 17 (9:21 p.m. PST, Sunday, Nov. 16). Once it lifts off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, the satellite will ride out a 57-minute sequence of events ending in spacecraft separation, when the satellite detaches from the rocket.\n\nThen Sentinel-6B’s real work begins. Orbiting Earth every 112 minutes at 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) per second, the satellite will eventually take over for its twin, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched five years ago, to continue a multidecade dataset for sea level measurements from space. Those measurements, along with atmospheric data the mission gathers, will help improve public safety and city planning while protecting coastal infrastructure, including power plants and defense interests. NASA will also use the data to refine atmospheric models that support the safe re-entry of Artemis astronauts.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what lies ahead for the satellite in the coming days.\n\nLaunch timeline\n\nMeasuring 19.1 feet (5.82 meters) long and 7.74 feet (2.36 meters) high (including the communications antennas), the satellite weighs in at around 2,600 pounds (1,200 kilograms) when loaded with propellant at launch.\n\nThe satellite will lift off from Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg. If needed, backup launch opportunities are available on subsequent days, with the 20-second launch window occurring about 12 to 13 minutes earlier each day.\n\nA little more than two minutes after the Falcon 9 rocket lifts off, the main engine cuts off. Shortly after, the rocket’s first and second stages separate, followed by second-stage engine start. The reusable Falcon 9 first stage then begins its automated boost-back burn to the launch site for a powered landing. About three minutes after launch, the two halves of the payload fairing, which protected the satellite as it traveled through the atmosphere, separate and fall safely back to Earth.\n\nThe first cutoff of the second stage engine takes place approximately eight minutes after liftoff, at which point the launch vehicle and the spacecraft will be in a temporary “parking” orbit. The second stage engine fires a second time about 44 minutes later, and about 57 minutes after liftoff, the rocket and the spacecraft separate. Roughly seven minutes after that, the satellite’s solar panels deploy. Sentinel-6B is expected to make first contact with ground controllers about 35 minutes after separation (roughly an hour and a half after liftoff) — a major milestone indicating that the spacecraft is healthy.\n\nScience mission\n\nFollowing launch operations, the team will focus on its next challenge: getting the spacecraft ready for science operations. Once in orbit, Sentinel-6B will fly about 30 seconds behind its twin, the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite. When scientists and engineers have completed cross-calibrating the data collected by the two spacecraft, Sentinel-6B will take over the role of providing primary sea level measurements while Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich will move into a different orbit. From there, researchers plan to use measurements from Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich for different purposes, including helping to map seafloor features (variations in sea surface height can reveal variations in ocean floor features, such as seamounts).\n\nSentinel-6B is part of a U.S.-European mission that will continue 30-year-plus record of sea-level measurements. Its observations will help build an accurate picture of local and global sea surface heights to support storm forecasting, secure coastal infrastructure, and help optimize commercial activities, such as shipping.\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nWhere to find launch coverage\n\nLaunch day coverage of the mission will be available on the agency’s website, including links to live streaming and blog updates beginning no earlier than 11 p.m. EST, Nov. 16, as the countdown milestones occur. Streaming video and photos of the launch will be accessible on demand shortly after liftoff. Follow countdown coverage on NASA’s Sentinel-6B blog.\n\nFor more information about NASA’s live programming schedule, visit\n\nplus.nasa.gov/scheduled-events.\n\nMore about Sentinel-6B\n\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS (Continuity of Service) mission is a collaboration between NASA, ESA, EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The European Commission contributed funding support while France’s space agency CNES (Centre National d’Études Spatiales) provided technical expertise. The mission also marks the first international involvement in Copernicus, the European Union’s Earth Observation Programme.\n\nA division of Caltech in Pasadena, JPL built three science instruments for each Sentinel-6 satellite: the Advanced Microwave Radiometer, the Global Navigation Satellite System – Radio Occultation, and the Laser Retroreflector Array. NASA is also contributing launch services, ground systems supporting operation of the NASA science instruments, the science data processors for two of these instruments, and support for the U.S. members of the international Ocean Surface Topography and Sentinel-6 science teams. The launch service is managed by NASA’s Launch Services Program, based at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nNews Media Contacts\n\nElizabeth Vlock\n\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n\n202-358-1600\n\nelizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov\n\nAndrew Wang / Andrew Good\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n\n626-379-6874 / 626-840-4291\n\nandrew.wang@jpl.nasa.gov / andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\n\n2025-125",
