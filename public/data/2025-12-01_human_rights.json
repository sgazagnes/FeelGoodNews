      "summary": "A woman living with disabilities in a camp for displaced people in Nigeria is demonstrating why it is essential that people like her are included in society and how dignity can be protected even in the harshest places.",
      "content": "“Sometimes, it feels like the world isn’t made for people like me,” said Shiminenge, her voice steady despite the weight of the words. In Gbajimba, north-central Nigeria, the 32-year-old navigates daily life in a camp for displaced people that offers little space, safety, or accessibility for people living with disabilities.\n\nAround her, tents stretch across dry, uneven ground. Paths turn muddy and difficult when it rains. Toilets and water points sit farther than she can reach without help. Yet every morning, she pushes through the same obstacles, determined not to disappear in a place that was never designed for her.\n\nShiminenge is one of more than 480,000 people displaced by intercommunal conflict in Benue State.\n\nShe fled her village in Guma in 2018 and has since lived in a camp for internally displaced persons in Gbajimba. Like many others, she left with little more than the hope of finding safety.\n\nBut her journey began long before displacement.\n\n© IOM/Elijah Elaigwu Shiminenge (right) has received support from the IOM and other humanitarian agencies.\n\nAt just nine months old, her parents were told she would never be able to walk after a diagnosis that shaped the course of her life. Growing up with a mobility impairment meant constant adjustments and an early understanding of what it means to move through the world without accessible support.\n\nToday, life in the camp has added another layer of daily challenge: poor shelter conditions, no accessible sanitation, and a landscape that is nearly impossible to navigate.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities marked annually on 3 December, she said: “In the camp, every step outside my tent was a struggle.” It’s not just the physical obstacles; it’s the feeling of being invisible, of being forgotten in a place where survival is already so hard.”\n\nBarriers to services and dignity\n\nThe sense of invisibility that Shiminenge describes is shared by many people with disabilities in displacement settings. They are often among the most marginalized within internally displaced populations, facing unique barriers to shelter, healthcare, sanitation, and essential services.\n\nIn these environments, inaccessible infrastructure and limited targeted support can heighten risks of neglect, exclusion, and abuse. As these barriers add up, they make displacement even more difficult and put the rights and dignity of people with disabilities at greater risk.\n\nDespite these limitations, Shiminenge refused to give up. Resourceful and determined, she began selling mosquito repellent in the camp, earning a small income while also helping protect other camp residents from malaria.\n\nHer resilience soon grew into advocacy. She helped form a disability association in Gbajimba, bringing together 18 other people living with disabilities to push for mobility aids, fair access to resources, and more inclusive facilities.\n\nCamp upgrade\n\nIn August 2024, a team with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) visited the camp to assess the living conditions of displaced persons. After years of feeling unseen in a crowded place, the visit felt different. “For the first time here, I felt someone was listening,” she said.\n\nResponding to the association’s requests, IOM with the support of the Benue State Emergency Management Agency, led a total camp redesign to ensure that the specific needs of people living with disabilities were addressed with dignity and respect.\n\nAs part of this redesign, nearly 4,000 upgraded emergency shelters were constructed in Gbajimba, each built to withstand the region’s seasonal rains and offer safer living conditions for displaced families.\n\nThe redesign also introduced a dedicated section for people living with disabilities, offering disability-friendly toilets, accessible water points, and kitchens designed for ease of use.\n\nThroughout the area, gently sloped ramps and communal social spaces were added, allowing residents to move independently and participate more fully in daily camp life.\n\n“These changes mean more than convenience; they give us a sense of dignity and belonging,” she said.",

      "summary": "We are learning a little more about how Pope Leo intends to carry out his duties, writes Religion Editor Aleem Maqbool.",
      "content": "Pope Leo finds his voice on first foreign trip\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Aleem Maqbool Religion Editor, Travelling with the Pope, Beirut Share Save\n\nGetty Images The Pope arrived in Beirut on Sunday\n\nPope Leo XIV has arrived in the Lebanese capital Beirut a week after Israeli air strikes hit the Lebanese capital. For a man known for being measured and careful in what he does, it seems quite the statement to land in a country so affected by conflict in what is his first foreign trip. The Pope has already spent three days in Turkey and, watching his diplomacy at close quarters, we are learning a little more about how he intends to carry out his duties as both spiritual leader and head of state of Vatican City. Pope Leo's interactions with journalists are gentle and softly spoken, and his words always appear thought out and deliberate.\n\nHis predecessor, Pope Francis, often spoke at length to reporters, sometimes very passionately and from the heart. But sometimes that meant his aides had the job of risk management, having to explain statements that appeared to be a departure from what the Pope had previously said or a diplomatic faux pas.\n\nReuters At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul\n\nPope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church. Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself. At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears. In a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith. As a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements. Standing next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\". At an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\" On the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state. \"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.\n\nGetty Images People of all major faiths turned out in southern Beirut with papal flags\n\nPope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people. The Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\". There is no question that in Lebanon in particular there has been a great deal of anticipation. \"It means a lot to me. He could have visited other countries, but he gave priority to Lebanon while it is still at war,\" Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, leader of the Maronite Catholic Church (to which most Lebanese Christians belong) told the BBC. \"He brings hope when the Lebanese feel abandoned and we feel uplifted,\" he says. The Pope's visit here provides a boost to the third of the country that is estimated to be Christian, but all Lebanese have been granted a two-day national holiday and those from all major faiths have welcomed him. Even Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim political party and militia considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and US, conveyed its greetings. In an open letter, the group talked of a \"full welcome\" and \"deep appreciation\" for the Pope's \"honourable presence\". Among the Lebanese and Vatican flags being waved as his motorcade drove from Beirut's airport, there were Hezbollah flags too. While in Lebanon, Pope Leo will meet Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, but also other local Christian, Muslim and Druze leaders. He has certainly cast himself as a bridge-builder; between peoples, faiths, Christian denominations and even closer to home, becoming pope as he did at a time when divisions between progressive and traditionalist Catholics appeared to be growing.\n\nGetty Images With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara",

      "summary": "“For decades, Nigerians have lived side by side in peace. Our unity is our strength, allowing foreign interests to divide us would be the greatest tragedy of all.”",
      "content": "This article by Mohammed Ibrahim was originally published by Peace News Network on November 17, 2025. An edited version is republished on Global Voices as part of a media partnership agreement.\n\nAmid renewed discussions about Nigeria’s security challenges, particularly its recent designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) by the United States, key Nigerian groups and peace advocates are calling for unity, caution, and locally driven reforms to address the ongoing violence by the Boko Haram and other militant organizations affecting communities across the country.\n\nTheir message is clear: The Boko Haram insurgency and the insecurity bedeviling the nation remain a national tragedy affecting both Christians and Muslims, and the priority should be building internal harmony and strengthening homegrown solutions to restore peace.\n\nFor over a decade, Boko Haram, formally known as Jama’atu Ahlis-Sunnah lid Da’awati wal-Jihad, has waged a brutal insurgency across Nigeria’s northeast and the wider Lake Chad region.\n\nFounded in 2002, the insurgent group began to launch violent attacks in the region in 2009. Boko Haram leaders oppose Western-style education and seek to impose strict Islamic law, though only about half of the country’s population identifies as Muslim. Its atrocities have included bombings of churches and mosques, large-scale kidnappings such as the 2014 abduction of 276 Chibok schoolgirls, and attacks on markets, bus stations, and military facilities.\n\nThe humanitarian consequences have been devastating, with reports of around 35,000 civilian deaths and over 2 million displacements due to the conflict.\n\nDespite frequent assumptions that Boko Haram primarily targets Christians, the group’s victims span religious lines. Former President Muhammadu Buhari once highlighted this reality, stating in 2020 that “some 90 percent of all Boko Haram’s victims have been Muslims,” emphasizing that the insurgency has shattered communities regardless of faith.\n\nThe designation led to debates among Muslims and Christians within Nigeria, especially on social media, each claiming to be the most affected by the decades of violence.\n\nIn the midst of these debates, several peace advocates, including both Muslim and Christian leaders, are calling for restraint, unity, and dialogue. They are urging Nigerians to implement locally driven reforms to address the ongoing violence and build long-term peace.\n\nThe Nigerian government’s response\n\nThe Nigerian government has recently intensified efforts to combat Boko Haram and related insurgent groups through a combination of military, financial, security, and rehabilitation measures. The government increased military firepower and successfully reclaimed territories previously occupied by insurgents.\n\nSecurity funding has been boosted, with additional equipment supplied to security agencies, and greater recognition given to local vigilante and hunter groups. Discussions on strengthening state policing have also been revived.\n\nThe military and other security forces have made efforts to trace and block Boko Haram’s funding channels, including kidnapping for ransom, illegal levies, and external financial support. International partners such as the United Nations (UN) and European Union (EU) are being engaged to assist in these efforts.\n\nGiven the cross-border nature of the insurgency, a new strategy was introduced involving the deployment of forest guards across more than 1,100 forests used as insurgent hideouts, enhancing security in the areas. State governments have also invested significantly in rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for repentant fighters to reduce active militant numbers.\n\n“Our unity is our strength”\n\nThe Northern Consensus Movement for Peace, Unity, Empowerment and Development Initiative (NSNCM) added its voice, warning against what it described as foreign-driven narratives that risk inflaming religious division. Awwal Abdullahi Aliyu, the organization’s National President, noted:\n\n“For decades, Nigerians have lived side by side in peace. Our unity is our strength. Allowing foreign interests to divide us would be the greatest tragedy of all.”\n\nHe dismissed claims of a government-sponsored campaign against Christians, and noted that “the killings and kidnappings across Nigeria affect both Christians and Muslims.” Labeling the situation as “Christian genocide,” he added, “is inaccurate and misleading.”\n\nAliyu also warned that foreign intervention disguised as humanitarian concern could worsen instability, noting that US military interventions in other countries have left behind “broken nations and shattered economies.”\n\nThe root causes of the violence, and calls for dialogue and justice\n\nSimilarly, the Kaduna chapter of the Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria (SCSN) rejected the US classification. The Council Secretary, engineer Hassan Abdul Rahman, said the decision reflects “a one-sided narrative that ignores the complex realities driving violence across Nigeria.”\n\nHe argued that Nigeria’s insecurity stems from “a complex web of ethnic, political, and economic challenges,” not a religiously motivated war.\n\nThe allegations of Christian genocide, he said, are false and threaten national unity. He urged Nigerians to avoid falling into sectarian traps encouraged by external forces. He said:\n\nThrough understanding, dialogue, and cooperation, Nigeria can overcome its challenges and build a peaceful future for all.\n\nPastor Yohanna Buru, founder of the Peace Revival and Reconciliation Foundation, pointed to the ongoing regrouping by Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) as core drivers of insecurity, rather than a campaign targeting Christians. He emphasized that the crisis is more complex than the narratives given, listing political issues, religious-heterogeneous differences, and extremism as factors.\n\nHe also said that “people who caused the real problem” were some Nigerian political actors who amplified internal grievances in ways that led to a misunderstanding of the country’s situation.\n\nPastor Buru outlined a broad list of peace-building strategies. “Let there be justice, equity to all, dialogue with all sundry, provide job opportunities for our teeming and jobless youth,” he said, calling to ensure “inclusiveness in leadership at all levels.”\n\nHe warned against politicizing security and stressed the need to “end corruption at all levels.” Religious leaders who preach hatred, he argued, must be banned or punished decisively. He called for strong interfaith engagement between Muslims and Christians.\n\nConcerned Nigerian elders: Reject rumours, resist division\n\nFormer Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme and peace advocate Usman Yusuf, a professor of haematology-oncology from Ahmadu Bello University, similarly urged calm, saying Nigerians must not allow rumors or misleading narratives to fracture interfaith relations. He warned:\n\nAmong Christians and Muslims there is a strong bond, and we have lived together peacefully. What some people want to bring among us is division. We will not sit with our arms folded and just watch.\n\nProfessor Yusuf said he and other elders, under the banner of Concerned Nigerian Citizens, are engaging traditional rulers, Islamic scholars, Christian leaders, and government officials to prevent conflict. He insisted:\n\nRumors should not be allowed to create conflict between Muslims and Christians. Whatever has been said about the alleged killing of Christians is not true. And anyone who loves peace in Nigeria knows it is not true.\n\nAccording to him, every single life, regardless of faith, matters and should be protected by authorities.\n\nNCYP: Strengthen local security, maintain sovereignty\n\nThe coalition group Northern Christian Youth Professionals (NCYP) commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for recent reforms in the security sector. The group expressed particular support for the newly approved Armed Forest Guard and renewed calls for State Police.\n\nNCYP reminded the government that although President Tinubu approved the Forest Guard initiative on May 14, 2025, “its implementation has had limited impact due to the alienation of forest communities from the initiative.”\n\nThey insisted that local communities and traditional rulers must guide recruitment, saying these communities “are naturally more motivated and committed to ending the menace.” They further encouraged the US and international partners, rather than sending troops, to offer technical assistance and training that strengthens Nigeria’s sovereignty while supporting efforts toward national peace and stability.",

Ils ont demandé des solutions locales pour lutter contre la violence et ont souligné que le conflit n’est pas une guerre religieuse mais un problème complexe lié à la politique, à l’économie et aux questions ethniques.\n\n**Impact**  \nCe message commun des leaders religieux est important car il remet en question les fausses idées selon lesquelles la violence viserait une seule religion. Il montre que les communautés musulmanes et chrétiennes souffrent toutes deux et souhaitent travailler ensemble pour la paix. Leur unité aide à empêcher les influences extérieures de provoquer plus de divisions et soutient les efforts pour reconstruire la confiance au Nigeria.\n\n**Prochaine étape**  \nLe gouvernement nigérian renforce les efforts de sécurité en augmentant les forces militaires, en soutenant les gardes communautaires locaux et en collaborant avec des partenaires internationaux. Les défenseurs de la paix souhaitent que ces programmes impliquent directement les populations locales et se concentrent sur l’équité, la création d’emplois pour les jeunes et la lutte contre la corruption. Les leaders religieux sont également encouragés à promouvoir le respect et le dialogue.\n\n**Phrase clé**  \nLes leaders musulmans et chrétiens du Nigeria unissent leurs forces pour promouvoir la paix et des solutions locales face à une violence qui affecte toutes les communautés.\n\n",

      "content": "Ukraine talks 'productive' but more work needed, Rubio says\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Patrick Jackson Share Save\n\nReuters Marco Rubio (left) with Rustem Umerov in Florida\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio says talks with Ukraine over a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war were productive, but there's \"more work to be done\". The talks, held in Florida, were attended by a Ukrainian delegation led by national security council secretary Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's new chief negotiator. Also at the meeting were President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Witkoff is due to visit Moscow for talks next week. Umerov was brought in to replace the Ukrainian president's top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, after he quit following an anti-corruption raid on his home. Sunday's meeting is the latest step in two weeks of intense diplomatic activity.\n\nIt was sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan which shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago. \"It's not just about the terms that ends fighting,\" Rubio said at the meeting in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity... I think we built on that today, but there's more work to be done.\" He also told the Ukrainian delegation that the aim of peace talks with Russia is to leave Ukraine \"sovereign, independent and prosperous\".\n\nWatch: Rubio says 'more needs to be done' after 'productive' Ukraine talks\n\nAs Sunday's talks began, Umerov said: \"We are discussing about the future of Ukraine, about the security of Ukraine, about no repetition of aggression of Ukraine, about prosperity of Ukraine, about how to rebuild Ukraine\". \"US is hearing us,\" he said, speaking in English. \"US is supporting us. US is working beside us.\" He later described the talks as \"productive and successful\" while Rubio said they had been \"very productive and useful\". Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said the talks were \"going along well\", and there was a good chance of a deal being made to end the conflict. Trump said earlier he would send Witkoff and possibly also Kushner to Moscow this week to meet President Vladimir Putin to discuss the peace plan which has been much revised. In a post on social media, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \"It is important that the talks have a constructive dynamic and that all issues were discussed openly and with a clear focus on ensuring Ukraine's sovereignty and national interests.\" He added he was grateful to the US and Trump for their efforts to try and end the war.",
