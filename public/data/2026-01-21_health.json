This advance could lead to ready-made cell therapies that are cheaper, faster, and easier to access.",
      "content": "For the first time, researchers at the University of British Columbia have shown how to consistently produce a crucial type of human immune cell, known as helper T cells, from stem cells in a controlled lab setting.\n\nThe research, published on January 7 in Cell Stem Cell, removes a major barrier that has slowed the development, affordability, and large-scale production of cell therapies. By solving this problem, the work could help make off-the-shelf treatments more accessible and effective for conditions such as cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and more.\n\n\"Engineered cell therapies are transforming modern medicine,\" said co-senior author Dr. Peter Zandstra, professor and director of the UBC School of Biomedical Engineering. \"This study addresses one of the biggest challenges in making these lifesaving treatments accessible to more people, showing for the first time a reliable and scalable way to grow multiple immune cell types.\"\n\nThe Promise and Limits of Living Drugs\n\nOver the past several years, engineered cell therapies such as CAR-T treatments have produced dramatic, sometimes lifesaving results for people with cancers that were once considered untreatable. These therapies work by reprogramming a patient's immune cells to recognize and destroy disease, effectively turning those cells into 'living drugs'.\n\nEven with their success, cell therapies remain costly, complex to manufacture, and out of reach for many patients around the world. One key reason is that most existing treatments rely on a patient's own immune cells, which must be collected and specially prepared over several weeks for each individual.\n\n\"The long-term goal is to have off-the-shelf cell therapies that are manufactured ahead of time and on a larger scale from a renewable source like stem cells,\" said co-senior author Dr. Megan Levings, a professor of surgery and biomedical engineering at UBC. \"This would make treatments much more cost-effective and ready when patients need them.\"\n\nCancer cell therapies are most effective when two types of immune cells work together. Killer T cells directly attack infected or cancerous cells. Helper T cells, which act as the immune system's conductors -- detecting health threats, activating other immune cells and sustaining the immune responses over time -- play a central coordinating role.\n\nWhile scientists have made progress using stem cells to create killer T cells in the lab, they have not been able to reliably generate helper T cells until now.\n\n\"Helper T cells are essential for a strong and lasting immune response,\" said Dr. Levings. \"It's critical that we have both to maximize the efficacy and flexibility of off-the-shelf therapies.\"\n\nA Key Advance Toward Stem Cell Based Immune Therapies\n\nIn the new study, the UBC research team addressed this long-standing challenge by carefully adjusting biological signals that guide how stem cells develop. This approach allowed them to precisely control whether stem cells became helper T cells or killer T cells.\n\nThe scientists found that a developmental signal known as Notch plays an important but time-sensitive role in immune cell formation. Notch is necessary early in development, but if the signal stays active for too long, it blocks the formation of helper T cells.\n\n\"By precisely tuning when and how much this signal is reduced, we were able to direct stem cells to become either helper or killer T cells,\" said co-first author Dr. Ross Jones, a research associate in the Zandstra Lab. \"We were able to do this in controlled laboratory conditions that are directly applicable in real-world biomanufacturing, which is an essential step toward turning this discovery into a viable therapy.\"\n\nThe team also confirmed that the lab-grown helper T cells functioned like real immune cells, not just in appearance but in behavior. The cells showed signs of full maturity, carried a wide variety of immune receptors, and were able to develop into specialized subtypes with distinct immune roles.\n\n\"These cells look and act like genuine human helper T cells,\" said co-first author Kevin Salim, a UBC PhD student in the Levings Lab. \"That's critical for future therapeutic potential.\"\n\nResearchers say the ability to generate both helper and killer T cells, and to carefully control their balance, could greatly improve the effectiveness of stem cell-derived immune therapies.\n\n\"This is a major step forward in our ability to develop scalable and affordable immune cell therapies,\" said Dr. Zandstra. \"This technology now forms the foundation for testing the role of helper T cells in supporting the elimination of cancer cells and generating new types of helper T cell-derived cells, such as regulatory T cells, for clinical applications.\"",

      "content": "Finger-prick blood test could be early warning for children with type 1 diabetes\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Michelle Roberts Digital health editor Share Save\n\nDiabetes UK Thanks to the study, Imogen, who is 12, is now receiving medication to help delay her diabetes\n\nAll UK children could be offered screening for type 1 diabetes using a simple finger-prick blood test, say researchers who have been running a large study. Currently, many young people go undiagnosed and risk developing a life-threatening complication called diabetic ketoacidosis that needs urgent hospital treatment. Identifying diabetes earlier could help avoid this and mean treatments to control problematic blood sugar levels can be given sooner. Some 17,000 children aged three to 13 have already been checked as part of the ELSA (Early Surveillance for Autoimmune diabetes) study, funded by diabetes charities.\n\nDiabetes UK Doctors hope the immunotherapy drug will delay Imogen's diabetes\n\nImogen, who is 12 and from the West Midlands, is one of those found to have diabetes thanks to the screening. Her mum Amy says knowing what's coming, rather than being taken by surprise, has made a massive difference to their confidence and peace of mind. \"Imogen took part in the study to further research and help others, but it has helped her too – being forewarned is being forearmed. \"She was always going to develop type 1 diabetes, but through ELSA we've been able to slow down the process and prepare. We know what's coming, but we're not scared.\" Imogen is being given ongoing support to prepare her for what is to come. Amy, who is 44 and has type 1 diabetes herself, is aware of the risks with the disease. She was diagnosed aged 13 after developing diabetic ketoacidosis. \"When I was diagnosed, I had no warning and ended up quite poorly in hospital,\" she recalls. Imogen is now trying a new type of drug designed to delay her diabetes. It's an immunotherapy called teplizumab that helps calm her immune system to slow its attack of her pancreas. In trials, the drug has been shown to delay the onset of diabetes by about three years, on average. It is not yet widely available on the NHS. Imogen is only the second child in the UK to get it.\n\nHow the diabetes screening test works\n\nThe finger-prick blood test checks for autoantibodies - proteins that the immune system makes which can attack the body's own tissues. In diabetes, these autoantibodies attack the pancreas - the organ which has the job of making insulin to control blood sugar. Family history can increase your risk of type 1 diabetes and scientists believe some things in the environment, like viruses, play a role in triggering it. Preliminary findings from ELSA in the 17,283 children, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal and funded by Diabetes UK and Breakthrough T1D, show: 75 children had one autoantibody, signalling increased future risk of type 1 diabetes\n\n160 had two or more autoantibodies but did not yet require insulin therapy, indicating early-stage type 1 diabetes\n\n7 were found to have undiagnosed type 1 diabetes, with all needing to start insulin immediately Children without autoantibodies are unlikely to develop type 1 diabetes.\n\nDr Elizabeth Robertson from Diabetes UK said: \"For too many families, a child's type 1 diabetes diagnosis still comes as a frightening emergency. But that doesn't have to be the case. \"Thanks to scientific breakthroughs, we now have the tools to identify children in the very earliest stages of type 1 diabetes - giving families precious time to prepare, avoid emergency hospital admissions, and access treatments that can delay the need for insulin for years.\" Rachel Connor, from Breakthrough T1D, added: \"The findings from ELSA's first phase signal a major step towards a future in which type 1 diabetes can be detected early, managed proactively, and potentially delayed through immunotherapy.\" The next phase of the study - called ELSA 2 - will now expand the screening offer to children aged 2 to 17. The finger-prick test can be done at home, in school or at a GP surgery. Several other countries are also exploring whether to introduce diabetes screening for children. Italy already has for those aged 1 to 17. It would be up to UK ministers, advised by the National Screening Committee and studies like ELSA, whether to do the same.\n\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes",

The findings point toward a new generation of Parkinson’s therapies aimed at the root cause, not just the symptoms.",
      "content": "About 1 million people in the United States are living with Parkinson's disease, and nearly 90,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the Parkinson's Foundation. The condition is a long-term, progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys dopamine-producing nerve cells, which are critical for controlled, fluid movement.\n\nMost available treatments focus on easing symptoms, but their benefits often fade over time. Now, researchers at Case Western Reserve University have identified a specific biological pathway that contributes to the underlying damage caused by the disease.\n\nA Harmful Protein Chain Reaction\n\nThe study, recently published in Molecular Neurodegeneration, explains how the buildup of toxic proteins inside brain cells leads to the death of neurons responsible for movement, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease.\n\n\"We've uncovered a harmful interaction between proteins that damages the brain's cellular powerhouses, called mitochondria,\" said Xin Qi, the study's senior author and Jeanette M. and Joseph S. Silber Professor of Brain Sciences at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. \"More importantly, we've developed a targeted approach that can block this interaction and restore healthy brain cell function.\"\n\nAfter three years of investigation, the team discovered that alpha-synuclein, a protein known to accumulate in Parkinson's disease, abnormally binds to an enzyme called ClpP. This enzyme normally helps maintain cellular health, but the interaction disrupts its function.\n\nDamage to the Brain's Energy Supply\n\nWhen alpha-synuclein interferes with ClpP, mitochondria begin to fail. These structures act as the cell's energy generators, and their impairment triggers widespread neurodegeneration and brain cell loss. Experiments across several research models also showed that this molecular interaction speeds up the progression of Parkinson's disease.\n\nTo counter this process, the researchers developed a treatment known as CS2. The compound is designed to block the damaging protein interaction and help mitochondria recover their normal function. CS2 acts as a decoy, drawing alpha-synuclein away from ClpP and preventing it from harming the cell's energy systems.\n\nIn multiple study models, including human brain tissue, patient-derived neurons and mice models, CS2 reduced brain inflammation and led to improvements in movement and cognitive performance.\n\nTargeting the Disease, Not Just Symptoms\n\n\"This represents a fundamentally new approach to treating Parkinson's disease,\" said Di Hu, a research scientist in the School of Medicine's Department of Physiology and Biophysics. \"Instead of just treating the symptoms, we're targeting one of the root causes of the disease itself.\"\n\nThe breakthrough builds on Case Western Reserve's strengths in mitochondrial biology and neurodegenerative disease research, along with its collaborative environment and advanced experimental models. These resources helped translate basic biological insights into a potential therapeutic strategy.\n\nNext Steps Toward Clinical Use\n\nOver the next five years, the team aims to move the discovery closer to human clinical trials. Planned efforts include refining the drug for use in people, expanding safety and effectiveness testing, identifying key molecular biomarkers tied to disease progression, and advancing toward patient-focused treatments.\n\n\"One day,\" Qi said, \"we hope to develop mitochondria-targeted therapies that will enable people to regain normal function and quality of life, transforming Parkinson's from a crippling, progressive condition into a manageable or resolved one.\"",

A common bacterium found in long-lasting wounds does not just resist drugs. It actively releases damaging molecules that overwhelm skin cells and stop them from repairing tissue. Researchers discovered that neutralizing these harmful molecules with antioxidants allows skin cells to recover and restart healing.",
      "content": "An international research team led by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), has identified a promising way to help chronic wounds heal faster, including wounds infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria.\n\nChronic wounds are a growing global health problem. Each year, about 18.6 million people worldwide develop diabetic foot ulcers.[1] Over a lifetime, as many as one in three people with diabetes may experience a foot ulcer.\n\nThese long lasting wounds are a leading cause of lower limb amputations. Ongoing infections often make healing even harder, trapping patients in a cycle of repeated complications.\n\nIn Singapore, chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure injuries and venous leg ulcers are becoming more common. More than 16,000 cases are reported each year, particularly among older adults and people living with diabetes.[2]\n\nHow a Common Bacterium Blocks Healing\n\nThe findings were published in Science Advances in collaboration with researchers from the University of Geneva, Switzerland. The study reveals how a widespread bacterium, Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), can actively interfere with the body's ability to heal wounds. The team also showed that blocking this process allows skin cells to recover and close wounds.\n\nE. faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen often found in chronic infections such as diabetic foot ulcers. These wounds are notoriously difficult to treat and frequently fail to heal, raising the risk of serious complications and amputation.\n\nAntibiotic resistance adds another layer of difficulty. Some strains of E. faecalis no longer respond to several commonly used antibiotics, making infections increasingly challenging to control.\n\nWhile doctors have long known that infections can slow wound healing, the exact biological reason for this effect has remained unclear.\n\nThe study was jointly led by NTU Associate Professor Guillaume Thibault from the School of Biological Sciences and Professor Kimberly Kline from the University of Geneva, who is also a visiting professor at SCELSE -- Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences and Engineering, at NTU.\n\nThe Role of Bacterial Metabolism and Cell Stress\n\nThe researchers found that E. faecalis behaves differently from many other bacteria that infect wounds. Instead of relying mainly on toxins, it releases reactive oxygen species (ROS), a metabolic byproduct that disrupts the normal healing function of human skin cells.\n\nFirst author NTU Research Fellow Dr Aaron Tan discovered that E. faecalis uses a metabolic process called extracellular electron transport (EET). This process continuously produces hydrogen peroxide, a highly reactive oxygen species capable of damaging living tissue.\n\nWhen E. faecalis is present in a wound, the hydrogen peroxide it produces causes oxidative stress in nearby human skin cells.\n\nLaboratory experiments showed that this oxidative stress activates a protective response in keratinocytes, the skin cells responsible for repairing wounds. This response is known as the \"unfolded protein response.\"\n\nUnder normal conditions, the unfolded protein response helps cells survive damage by slowing protein production and other essential activities, giving them time to recover.\n\nHowever, once triggered in this context, the response effectively paralyzes the cells. It prevents them from moving into the wound area to seal the damaged tissue, a process known as migration.\n\nTo confirm the importance of this pathway, the researchers tested a genetically modified strain of E. faecalis that lacked the EET pathway. These altered bacteria produced much less hydrogen peroxide and were no longer able to block wound healing.\n\nThis result confirmed that the metabolic pathway plays a central role in how E. faecalis disrupts skin repair. The team then investigated whether neutralizing hydrogen peroxide could reverse the damage.\n\nA Potential Treatment Beyond Antibiotics\n\nWhen the researchers treated stressed skin cells with catalase, a naturally occurring antioxidant enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide, cellular stress levels dropped. As a result, the cells regained their ability to migrate and heal the wound.\n\nThis approach offers an alternative way to address infections caused by antibiotic resistant E. faecalis. Instead of trying to kill the bacteria with antibiotics, the strategy focuses on neutralizing the harmful substances the bacteria produce.\n\n\"Our findings show that the bacteria's metabolism itself is the weapon, which was a surprise finding previously unknown to scientists,\" said Assoc Prof Thibault, who is also the Assistant Dean (International Engagement) at the College of Science.\n\n\"Instead of focusing on killing the bacteria with antibiotics, which is becoming increasingly difficult and leads to future antibiotic resistance, we can now neutralize it by blocking the harmful products it generates and restoring wound healing. Instead of targeting the source, we neutralize the actual cause of the chronic wounds -- the reactive oxygen species.\"\n\nThe study directly links bacterial metabolism to dysfunction in human cells, pointing to a new therapeutic strategy for chronic wounds.\n\nThe researchers suggest that future wound dressings infused with antioxidants such as catalase could help promote healing.\n\nBecause antioxidants like catalase are already widely used and well understood, the team believes this approach could move from laboratory research to clinical use faster than developing an entirely new drug.\n\nSince the mechanism was demonstrated using human skin cells, the findings are directly relevant to human physiology and may lead to new treatments for people with non healing wounds.\n\nNext, the researchers plan to move toward human clinical trials after identifying the most effective way to deliver antioxidants through ongoing studies in animal models.",
