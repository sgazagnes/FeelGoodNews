      "title": "Earth has been feeding the moon for billions of years",
      "summary": "Tiny bits of Earth’s atmosphere have been drifting to the moon for billions of years, guided by Earth’s magnetic field. Rather than blocking particles, the magnetic field can funnel them along invisible lines that sometimes stretch all the way to the moon. This explains mysterious gases found in Apollo samples and suggests lunar soil may hold a long-term archive of Earth’s history. It could also become a valuable resource for future lunar explorers.",
      "content": "New findings suggest that Earth's magnetic field has played a surprising role in transporting particles from our atmosphere to the moon over vast stretches of time.\n\nAt first glance, the moon appears lifeless and inert. But its surface may tell a more complex story. For billions of years, tiny fragments of Earth's atmosphere have likely been arriving on the moon and becoming embedded in its soil. These materials may include substances that could one day help support human activity on the lunar surface. Until recently, however, scientists were unsure how these particles could travel such enormous distances or how long the process had been underway.\n\nResearchers at the University of Rochester now report that Earth's magnetic field may assist rather than prevent this transfer. Their study, published in Nature Communications Earth and Environment, shows that atmospheric particles lifted by the solar wind can be guided outward along Earth's magnetic field. Since this magnetic shield has existed for billions of years, it could have enabled a slow but continuous movement of material from Earth to the moon across deep time.\n\n\"By combining data from particles preserved in lunar soil with computational modeling of how solar wind interacts with Earth's atmosphere, we can trace the history of Earth's atmosphere and its magnetic field,\" says Eric Blackman, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and a distinguished scientist at URochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE).\n\nThese results suggest that lunar soil may preserve a long-running archive of Earth's atmosphere. They also raise the possibility that the moon contains resources that could prove valuable for astronauts living and working there in the future.\n\nWhat Apollo Samples Revealed\n\nMoon rocks and soil collected during the Apollo missions in the 1970s have been central to this research. Analyses of these samples show that the moon's surface layer, known as regolith, contains volatile substances such as water, carbon dioxide, helium, argon, and nitrogen. Some of these materials clearly come from the solar wind, the steady flow of charged particles streaming from the sun. However, the quantities found, particularly nitrogen, are too large to be explained by solar wind alone.\n\nIn 2005, scientists from the University of Tokyo proposed that part of these volatiles originated in Earth's atmosphere. They argued that this transfer could only have occurred early in Earth's history, before the planet developed a magnetic field. Their assumption was that once the magnetic field formed, it would block atmospheric particles from escaping into space.\n\nThe Rochester team reached a different conclusion.\n\nSimulating the Journey From Earth to the Moon\n\nTo better understand how atmospheric particles might reach the moon, the researchers used advanced computer simulations. The team included Shubhonkar Paramanick, a graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and a Horton Fellow at the LLE; John Tarduno, the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences; and Jonathan Carroll-Nellenback, a computational scientist at the Center for Integrated Research Computing and an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.\n\nTheir simulations tested two conditions. One represented an early version of Earth with no magnetic field and a stronger solar wind. The other modeled present-day Earth, complete with a strong magnetic field and a weaker solar wind. The results showed that particle transfer to the moon was far more effective in the modern Earth scenario.\n\nIn this case, the solar wind can knock charged particles loose from Earth's upper atmosphere. These particles then follow Earth's magnetic field lines, some of which extend far enough into space to intersect the moon's orbit. Over billions of years, this process acts like a slow funnel, allowing small amounts of Earth's atmosphere to settle onto the lunar surface.\n\nA Record of Earth's Past and a Resource for the Future\n\nBecause this exchange has occurred over such long timescales, the moon may hold a chemical record of Earth's atmospheric history. Studying lunar soil could offer scientists new insights into how Earth's climate, oceans, and even life itself evolved over billions of years.\n\nThe steady delivery of particles also suggests the moon may contain more useful materials than previously assumed. Volatile elements such as water and nitrogen could help sustain long-term human activity on the moon, reducing the need to ship supplies from Earth and making future exploration more practical.\n\n\"Our study may also have broader implications for understanding early atmospheric escape on planets like Mars, which lacks a global magnetic field today but had one similar to Earth in the past, along with a likely thicker atmosphere,\" Paramanick says. \"By examining planetary evolution alongside atmospheric escape across different epochs, we can gain insight into how these processes shape planetary habitability.\"\n\nThe research was supported in part by funding from NASA and the National Science Foundation.",

      "content": "A team using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has uncovered a new type of astronomical object — a starless, gas-rich, dark-matter cloud considered a “relic” or remnant of early galaxy formation. Nicknamed “Cloud-9,” this is the first confirmed detection of such an object in the universe — a finding that furthers the understanding of galaxy formation, the early universe, and the nature of dark matter itself.\n\n“This is a tale of a failed galaxy,” said the program’s principal investigator, Alejandro Benitez-Llambay of the Milano-Bicocca University in Milan, Italy. “In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes. In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.”\n\nThe results, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, were presented at a press conference Monday at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix.\n\n“This cloud is a window into the dark universe,” said team member Andrew Fox of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy/Space Telescope Science Institute (AURA/STScI) for the European Space Agency. “We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it’s difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn’t emit light. Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.”\n\nThis image shows the location of Cloud-9, which is 14 million light-years from Earth. The diffuse magenta is radio data from the ground-based Very Large Array (VLA) showing the presence of the cloud. The dashed circle marks the peak of radio emission, which is where researchers focused their search for stars. Follow-up observations by the Hubble Space Telescope’s Advanced Camera for Surveys found no stars within the cloud. The few objects that appear within its boundaries are background galaxies. Before the Hubble observations, scientists could argue that Cloud-9 is a faint dwarf galaxy whose stars could not be seen with ground-based telescopes due to the lack of sensitivity. Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys shows that, in reality, the failed galaxy contains no stars. Science: NASA, ESA, VLA, Gagandeep Anand (STScI), Alejandro Benitez-Llambay (University of Milano-Bicocca); Image Processing: Joseph DePasquale (STScI)\n\nThe object is called a Reionization-Limited H I Cloud, or \"RELHIC.” The term “H I” refers to neutral hydrogen, and “RELHIC” describes a natal hydrogen cloud from the universe’s early days, a fossil leftover that has not formed stars. For years, scientists have looked for evidence of such a theoretical phantom object. It wasn’t until they turned Hubble toward the cloud, confirming that it is indeed starless, that they found support for the theory.\n\n“Before we used Hubble, you could argue that this is a faint dwarf galaxy that we could not see with ground-based telescopes. They just didn't go deep enough in sensitivity to uncover stars,” said lead author Gagandeep Anand of STScI. “But with Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys, we're able to nail down that there's nothing there.”\n\nThe discovery of this relic cloud was a surprise. “Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,” said STScI’s Rachael Beaton, who is also on the research team.\n\nAstronomers think RELHICs are dark matter clouds that couldn’t accumulate enough gas to form stars. They represent a window into the early stages of galaxy formation. Cloud-9 suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe — other failed galaxies. This discovery provides new insights into the dark components of the universe that are difficult to study through traditional observations, which focus on bright objects like stars and galaxies.\n\nScientists have studied hydrogen clouds near the Milky Way for many years, but these clouds tend to be much bigger and more irregular than Cloud-9. Compared with other observed hydrogen clouds, Cloud-9 is smaller, more compact, and highly spherical, making it look very different from the others.\n\nThe core of this object is composed of neutral hydrogen and is about 4,900 light-years in diameter. Researchers measured the hydrogen gas in Cloud-9 by the radio waves it emits, measuring it to be approximately one million times the mass of the Sun. Assuming that the gas pressure is balancing the dark matter cloud’s gravity, which appears to be the case, researchers calculated Cloud-9’s dark matter must be about five billion solar masses.\n\nCloud-9 is an example of structures and mysteries that don't involve stars. Just looking at stars doesn’t give the full picture. Studying the gas and dark matter helps provide a more complete understanding of what's going on in these systems that would otherwise be unknown.\n\nObservationally, identifying these failed galaxies is challenging because nearby objects outshine them. Such systems are also vulnerable to environmental effects like ram-pressure stripping, which can remove gas as the cloud moves through intergalactic space. These factors further reduce their expected numbers.\n\nThe starless relic was discovered three years ago as part of a radio survey by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in Guizhou, China, a finding later confirmed by the Green Bank Telescope and the Very Large Array facilities in the United States. But only with Hubble could researchers definitively determine that the failed galaxy contains no stars.\n\nCloud-9 was simply named sequentially, having been the ninth gas cloud identified on the outskirts of a nearby spiral galaxy, Messier 94 (M94). The cloud is close to M94 and appears to have a physical association with the galaxy. High-resolution radio data shows slight gas distortions, possibly indicating interaction between the cloud and galaxy.\n\nThe cloud may eventually form a galaxy in the future, provided it grows more massive — although how that would occur is under speculation. If it were much bigger, say, more than 5 billion times the mass of our Sun, it would have collapsed, formed stars, and become a galaxy that would be no different than any other galaxy we see. If it were much smaller than that, the gas could have been dispersed and ionized and there wouldn't be much left. But it’s in a sweet spot where it could remain as a RELHIC.\n\nThe lack of stars in this object provides a unique window into the intrinsic properties of dark matter clouds. The rarity of such objects and the potential for future surveys is expected to enhance the discovery of more of these “failed galaxies” or “relics,” resulting in insights into the early universe and the physics of dark matter.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope has been operating for more than three decades and continues to make ground-breaking discoveries that shape our fundamental understanding of the universe. Hubble is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the telescope and mission operations. Lockheed Martin Space, based in Denver, also supports mission operations at Goddard. The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, conducts Hubble science operations for NASA.",
