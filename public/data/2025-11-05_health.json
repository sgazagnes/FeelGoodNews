      "summary": "A new compound called CMX410 may change the fight against tuberculosis. It targets a weak point in the bacteria’s defenses, even in drug-resistant forms of the disease. Created using a cutting-edge chemistry method, the drug shows promise for being both powerful and safe. Scientists believe it could lead to shorter, more effective treatments for millions of people.",
      "content": "Scientists have created a promising new compound that could mark a major step forward in the global effort to control tuberculosis, the world's deadliest infectious disease.\n\nA new study in Nature highlights the potential of this compound, called CMX410, which targets a key enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The compound has shown success even against drug-resistant strains, a growing global problem that makes treatment more difficult and less effective.\n\nThe research was led by James Sacchettini, Ph.D., the Rodger J. Wolfe-Welch Foundation Chair in Science and professor at Texas A&M University, along with Case McNamara, Ph.D., senior director of infectious disease at the Calibr-Skaggs Institute for Innovative Medicines, a division of Scripps Research that develops next-generation therapies.\n\nThis discovery emerged from collaborations within the TB Drug Accelerator program, a Gates Foundation-funded initiative that brings together researchers to advance the most promising tuberculosis treatments.\n\n\"A lot of people think of tuberculosis as a disease of the past,\" Sacchettini said. \"But in reality, it remains a major public health issue requiring significant attention, collaboration and innovation to overcome.\"\n\nA new approach to an old enemy\n\nThe newly identified compound from AgriLife Research and Calibr-Skaggs works by shutting down a vital enzyme, polyketide synthase 13 (Pks13), which the bacterium needs to build its protective cell wall. Without this structure, M. tuberculosis cannot survive or infect the body.\n\nScientists have long known that Pks13 is an important target for TB drugs, but developing a safe and effective inhibitor has proven difficult. CMX410 succeeds where earlier attempts fell short. Its design makes it extremely specific to its target, resulting in fewer unwanted effects. The compound forms an irreversible bond with a critical site on Pks13, which prevents resistance from developing and keeps the drug focused on its intended target.\n\nTo achieve this, researchers used a technique known as click chemistry -- a method that links molecules together like puzzle pieces. The approach was pioneered by co-author Barry Sharpless, Ph.D., W.M. Keck Professor of Chemistry at Scripps Research and a two-time Nobel Laureate. His work has opened the door to vast libraries of chemical compounds that can be rapidly tested and refined.\n\n\"This technique represents a new tool for drug design,\" said McNamara. \"We expect to see its uses expand in the coming years to help address public health concerns with a critical need, including tuberculosis.\"\n\nPromising early results\n\nThe team began by screening a collection of compounds from the Sharpless lab to find those capable of slowing M. tuberculosis growth. After months of optimization, led by co-first authors Baiyuan Yang, Ph.D., and Paridhi Sukheja, Ph.D., CMX410 emerged as the most effective and balanced candidate.\n\nYang's team tested more than 300 variations to fine-tune the compound's power, safety, and selectivity. The final version was tested against 66 different TB strains, including multidrug-resistant samples taken from patients, and proved effective in nearly all cases.\n\n\"Identifying this novel target was an exciting moment,\" said Sukheja, who led many early studies showing CMX410 could target a previously unexplored gene. \"It opened up a completely new path forward, especially against strains that have learned to evade existing treatments.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that CMX410 can be used safely alongside existing TB drugs, a crucial advantage since treatment typically involves multiple medications taken for several months. In animal testing, no negative side effects were observed even at the highest doses. Because of its precision, the compound is unlikely to disturb healthy bacteria or cause gut imbalance -- an issue often linked to traditional antibiotics.\n\nMoving closer to better therapies\n\nThe addition of a specialized chemical group that allows CMX410 to permanently attach to its target makes it one of the most selective compounds of its kind. Although more studies are needed before it can be tested in humans, early findings suggest strong potential for future TB treatment.\n\n\"These early results are very encouraging,\" said Inna Krieger, Ph.D., senior research scientist in Sacchettini's lab and co-first author of the paper. \"Cell wall-targeting antibiotics have long been a cornerstone of tuberculosis treatment. However, after decades of widespread use, their effectiveness is waning due to the rise of drug-resistant strains.\n\n\"We are working to discover new drugs that disrupt essential biological processes and identify optimal combinations with existing drugs to enable shorter, safer and more effective treatment regimens. Through these efforts, we hope to help move the world closer to a future free from tuberculosis.\"",

      "summary": "Using powerful 7-Tesla brain imaging, researchers mapped how the brainstem manages pain differently across the body. They discovered that distinct regions activate for facial versus limb pain, showing the brain’s built-in precision pain control system. The findings could lead to targeted, non-opioid treatments that use cannabinoid mechanisms instead of opioids, offering safer pain relief options.",
      "content": "Key Research Findings\n\nScientists have discovered that the human brain has its own built-in pain map, activating different regions when easing pain in the face, arms, or legs.\n\nPlacebo pain relief only works in the exact area where the brain expects it to happen.\n\nUnderstanding this system could lead to safer, more precise treatments that target pain exactly where it occurs.\n\nMapping the Brain's Hidden System for Pain\n\nResearchers at the University of Sydney have revealed a brainstem network that manages pain differently depending on where it occurs in the body. Using placebo pain relief, they discovered a map-like system that fine-tunes pain control for specific regions, such as the face, arms, or legs. The findings could lead to safer and more precise pain therapies that avoid the risks of opioid-based treatments.\n\nThe brainstem functions as the main communication pathway between the brain and spinal cord, directing signals that control thought, sensation, and survival responses. It also produces most of the brain's vital neurochemicals, making it a central hub for regulating both physical and emotional states.\n\nPublished in Science, the study used 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (one of the most advanced brain scanners available, with only two in Australia) to identify how two major regions of the brainstem coordinate pain relief through placebo responses.\n\nDr. Lewis Crawford, lead author and research fellow at the School of Medical Sciences and the Brain and Mind Centre, explained, \"This is the first time we've seen such a precise and detailed pain map in the human brainstem, showing us that it tailors pain relief to the specific part of the body that's experiencing it.\"\n\nThis breakthrough builds on decades of research led by co-author Professor Kevin Keay, Deputy Head of the School of Medical Sciences, who has long studied the brain's role in pain regulation.\n\nHow the Placebo Effect Reveals the Brain's Pain Control\n\nTo explore how the brain organizes pain relief, researchers tested 93 healthy volunteers by applying heat to different parts of their bodies. A placebo cream was used on some areas, but scientists secretly lowered the temperature to convince participants that the cream was reducing pain.\n\nEach participant's heat level was personalized to reach a moderate level of discomfort, based on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable), typically between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius.\n\nWhen the same heat stimulus was later reapplied, participants continued to feel less pain in the areas where the placebo cream had been used, even though the temperature was no longer reduced. About 61 percent reported this effect, a strong indication of genuine placebo-driven pain relief.\n\nDr. Crawford noted, \"We found that upper parts of the brainstem were more active when relieving facial pain, while lower regions were engaged for arm or leg pain.\"\n\nPinpointing the Brain's Pain-Relief Centers\n\nTwo major brainstem regions, the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), were identified as central to this system. Each showed distinct patterns of activity depending on where the pain occurred. Upper sections of the PAG and RVM responded to facial pain, while lower sections activated for pain in the limbs.\n\nAccording to Dr. Crawford, \"The brain's natural pain relief system is more nuanced than we thought. Essentially, it has a built-in system to control pain in specific areas. It's not just turning pain off everywhere; but working in a highly coordinated, anatomically precise system.\"\n\nA Blueprint for Targeted Pain Therapies\n\nUnderstanding which brainstem areas are linked to different parts of the body may open new avenues for developing non-invasive therapies that reduce pain without widespread side effects.\n\n\"We now have a blueprint for how the brain controls pain in a spatially organized way,\" said Professor Luke Henderson, senior author and Professor in the School of Medical Sciences and the Brain and Mind Centre. \"This could help us design more effective and personalized treatments, especially for people with chronic pain in a specific area of their body.\"\n\nThe study also challenges long-held assumptions about how placebo pain relief works. Instead of relying on the brain's opioid system, experts say a different part of the brainstem -- the lateral PAG -- is not only responsible but works without using opioids and could instead be linked to cannabinoid activity.\n\n\"Opioid-based pain relief typically activates central areas of the brain and can affect the whole body, whereas the cannabinoid circuit that we identified appears to operate in more targeted regions of the brainstem,\" said Dr. Crawford. \"This supports the idea that cannabinoids may play a role in localized, non-opioid pain control.\"\n\n\"Knowing exactly where pain relief is happening in the brain means we can target that area or assess whether a drug is working in the right place,\" said Dr. Crawford. \"This could lead to more precise treatments for chronic pain that don't rely on opioids and work exactly where the brain expects pain relief to occur -- a huge step forward for pain management.\"",

      "content": "Adding even a modest number of steps to your daily routine may help delay the advancement of Alzheimer's disease, especially among those most vulnerable to it, according to new research. In a study published in Nature Medicine, scientists from Mass General Brigham found that greater physical activity was linked to slower cognitive decline in older adults who had higher levels of amyloid-beta, a protein strongly tied to Alzheimer's.\n\nOn average, people who walked between 3,000 and 5,000 steps a day experienced about three years of delay in cognitive decline. Those who walked 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day saw that delay extend to around seven years. In contrast, participants who were largely inactive showed faster accumulation of tau proteins in the brain, which is associated with Alzheimer's progression, and more rapid declines in thinking skills and daily functioning.\n\n\"This sheds light on why some people who appear to be on an Alzheimer's disease trajectory don't decline as quickly as others,\" said senior author Jasmeer Chhatwal, MD, PhD, of the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology. \"Lifestyle factors appear to impact the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that lifestyle changes may slow the emergence of cognitive symptoms if we act early.\"\n\nLong-Term Study on Activity and Brain Changes\n\nResearchers examined 296 individuals aged 50 to 90 who showed no cognitive impairment at the start of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants wore waistband pedometers to track physical activity and underwent PET scans to measure amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain. They completed yearly cognitive assessments over a period ranging from two to 14 years (average = 9.3 years), and a subset received additional brain scans to monitor changes in tau over time.\n\nThe results showed that participants with elevated amyloid-beta who took more daily steps experienced slower cognitive decline and a slower buildup of tau proteins. Statistical modeling indicated that the primary benefit of physical activity came from its association with slower tau accumulation. Among participants with low amyloid-beta levels, there was little evidence of either cognitive decline or tau buildup, and no significant link to activity levels.\n\nBuilding Cognitive Resilience Through Movement\n\n\"We are thrilled that data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study has helped the field better understand the importance of physical activity for maintaining brain health,\" said co-author Reisa Sperling, MD, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham and co-principal investigator of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. \"These findings show us that it's possible to build cognitive resilience and resistance to tau pathology in the setting of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This is particularly encouraging for our quest to ultimately prevent Alzheimer's disease dementia, as well as to decrease dementia due to multiple contributing factors.\"\n\nThe team plans to further explore which types of physical activity are most beneficial, including how intensity and long-term exercise patterns might influence brain health. They also aim to uncover the biological mechanisms that connect physical activity, tau buildup, and cognitive function. The researchers believe these insights could inform future clinical trials that test whether exercise-based interventions can slow cognitive decline in older adults, particularly those at elevated risk for Alzheimer's.\n\nEmpowering People to Take Action\n\n\"We want to empower people to protect their brain and cognitive health by keeping physically active,\" said first-author Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, MD, a cognitive neurologist at Mass General Brigham. \"Every step counts -- and even small increases in daily activities can build over time to create sustained changes in habit and health.\"\n\nAuthorship: In addition to Yau, Chhatwal and Sperling, Mass General Brigham authors include Dylan R.

Proteínas como la amiloide beta y la tau se acumulan en el cerebro y dañan las células en esta enfermedad.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigadores de Mass General Brigham estudiaron a casi 300 personas mayores durante unos nueve años. Contaron sus pasos diarios y escanearon sus cerebros para detectar estas proteínas dañinas. Descubrieron que quienes caminaban entre 3,000 y 7,500 pasos al día tenían un retraso en la pérdida de memoria y habilidades de pensamiento. Caminar entre 3,000 y 5,000 pasos retrasó los síntomas unos tres años, y entre 5,000 y 7,500 pasos, unos siete años. Los que caminaban poco tenían más rápida acumulación de la proteína tau y un deterioro cerebral más rápido.\n\n**Impacto** – Este estudio muestra que caminar moderadamente puede frenar los cambios cerebrales que causan los síntomas del Alzheimer. Explica por qué algunas personas con señales tempranas no empeoran tan rápido. Es importante porque caminar es fácil y accesible para ayudar a proteger el cerebro.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos quieren saber qué tipos de ejercicio son mejores y cómo la actividad física afecta las proteínas del cerebro. Planean usar esta información para crear mejores maneras de prevenir o retrasar el Alzheimer, especialmente en personas con riesgo.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Caminar unos pocos miles de pasos al día puede frenar los cambios cerebrales y problemas de pensamiento relacionados con el Alzheimer, ofreciendo una forma sencilla de proteger la memoria y la mente.",

      "title": "Scientists reverse anxiety by rebalancing the brain",
      "summary": "Researchers have discovered a specific set of neurons in the amygdala that can trigger anxiety and social deficits when overactive. By restoring the excitability balance in this brain region, they successfully reversed these symptoms in mice. The results point toward targeted neural therapies for emotional disorders. This finding could reshape how anxiety and depression are treated at the circuit level.",
      "content": "A research team at the Institute for Neurosciences (IN), led by Juan Lerma, has uncovered how a distinct group of neurons in the amygdala -- a region of the brain involved in processing emotions -- contributes to anxiety, depression, and changes in social behavior. The discovery, published in iScience, shows that restoring the balance of neuronal excitability within a precise part of the amygdala can reverse these behavioral changes in mice.\n\nRestoring Brain Balance to Reverse Anxiety\n\n\"We already knew the amygdala was involved in anxiety and fear, but now we've identified a specific population of neurons whose imbalanced activity alone is sufficient to trigger pathological behaviors,\" explains Lerma. His team used a genetically modified mouse model that overexpresses the Grik4 gene, which increases the production of GluK4-type glutamate receptors and heightens neuronal excitability. These mice, developed by the same laboratory in 2015, displayed anxiety and social withdrawal similar to symptoms seen in people with conditions such as autism or schizophrenia.\n\nThe researchers were able to normalize Grik4 expression specifically in neurons located in the basolateral amygdala. This adjustment reestablished normal communication with a group of inhibitory neurons in the centrolateral amygdala known as \"regular firing neurons.\" \"That simple adjustment was enough to reverse anxiety-related and social deficit behaviors, which is remarkable,\" says Álvaro García, the study's first author.\n\nThe team assessed the animals using electrophysiological recordings and behavioral tests designed to measure anxiety, depression, and social interaction. These tests evaluate traits such as the preference for open or enclosed spaces and interest in unfamiliar mice. Using genetic engineering tools and modified viruses, the scientists precisely corrected the dysfunction in the basolateral amygdala and tracked changes in both neuronal activity and overall behavior.\n\nWidespread Effects Beyond Genetic Models\n\nThe researchers then applied the same approach to normal (wild-type) mice that naturally showed higher anxiety levels. The treatment also reduced their anxiety. \"This validates our findings and gives us confidence that the mechanism we identified is not exclusive to a specific genetic model, but may represent a general principle for how these emotions are regulated in the brain,\" Lerma notes.\n\nSome cognitive deficits, such as problems with object recognition memory, were not corrected, suggesting that other regions like the hippocampus may also play a role in these disorders. Even so, the results open promising new avenues for therapy. \"Targeting these specific neural circuits could become an effective and more localized strategy to treat affective disorders,\" Lerma concludes.\n\nThis research was supported by the Spanish State Research Agency (AEI) -- Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the Severo Ochoa Excellence Program for Research Centers at the Institute for Neurosciences CSIC-UMH, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and the Generalitat Valenciana through the PROMETEO and CIPROM programs.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Anxiety and social problems are linked to how certain brain cells work in the amygdala, a part of the brain that helps control emotions. Scientists wanted to understand which cells cause these feelings when they become too active.\n\n**What happened** – A team led by Juan Lerma at the Institute for Neurosciences studied mice with extra active neurons in the amygdala caused by a gene called Grik4. These mice showed anxiety and avoided social contact. The researchers fixed this by restoring balance to these neurons using genetic tools. After the fix, the mice behaved normally again, showing less anxiety and more social interaction.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it shows that anxiety and social problems can be reversed by targeting specific brain cells. The method worked not only in genetically modified mice but also in normal mice with natural anxiety. This suggests the discovery could lead to new treatments for emotional disorders like anxiety and depression by focusing on exact brain circuits.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to explore how this approach might be used in humans and whether other brain areas, like the hippocampus, also need attention. Further research will test if targeting these neurons can create safe and effective therapies for emotional problems.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Researchers found a way to reduce anxiety and improve social behavior in mice by fixing the balance of specific neurons in the brain’s emotion center.\n",
