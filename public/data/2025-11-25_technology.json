      "content": "Ten years ago, I would have turned my nose up at the idea that we already understood how to get machines to think. In the 2010s, my team at Google Research was working on a wide variety of artificial-intelligence models, including the next-word predictor that powers the keyboard on Android smartphones. Artificial neural networks of the sort we were training were finally solving long-standing challenges in visual perception, speech recognition, game playing and many other domains. But it seemed absurd to me that a mere next-word predictor could ever truly understand new concepts, write jokes, debug code or do any of the myriad other things that are hallmarks of human intelligence.\n\n‘Solving’ this kind of intelligence would surely require some fundamentally new scientific insight. And that would probably be inspired by neuroscience — the study of the only known embodiment of general intelligence, the brain.\n\nScience and the new age of AI: a Nature special\n\nMy views back then were comfortably within the scientific mainstream, but in retrospect were also tinged with snobbery. My training was in physics and computational neuroscience, and I found the Silicon Valley hype distasteful at times. The cultish view that Moore’s law — the observation that computing power increases exponentially over time — would solve not only every technological problem, but also all social and scientific ones, seemed naive to me. It was the epitome of the mindset “when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail”.\n\nI was wrong. In 2019, colleagues at Google trained a massive (for the time) next-word predictor — technically, a next-token predictor, with each token corresponding to a word fragment — codenamed Meena1. It seemed able, albeit haltingly, to understand new concepts, write jokes, make logical arguments and much else. Meena’s scaled-up successor, LaMDA, did better2. This trend has continued since. In 2025, we find ourselves in the rather comical situation of expecting such large language models to respond fluently, intelligently, responsibly and accurately to all sorts of esoteric questions and demands that humans would fail to answer. People get irritated when these systems fail to answer appropriately — while simultaneously debating when artificial general intelligence will arrive.\n\nHow to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI\n\nLarge language models can be unreliable and say dumb things, but then, so can humans. Their strengths and weaknesses are certainly different from ours. But we are running out of intelligence tests that humans can pass reliably and AI models cannot. By those benchmarks, and if we accept that intelligence is essentially computational — the view held by most computational neuroscientists — we must accept that a working ‘simulation’ of intelligence actually is intelligence. There was no profound discovery that suddenly made obviously non-intelligent machines intelligent: it did turn out to be a matter of scaling computation.\n\nOther researchers disagree with my assessment of where we are with AI. But in what follows, I want to accept the premise that intelligent machines are already here, and turn the mirror back on ourselves. If scaling up computation yields AI, could the kind of intelligence shown by living organisms, humans included, also be the result of computational scaling? If so, what drove that — and how did living organisms become computational in the first place?\n\nOver the past several years, a growing group of collaborators and I have begun to find some tentative, but exciting answers. AI, biological intelligence and, indeed, life itself might all have emerged from the same process. This insight could shed fresh light not just on AI, neuroscience and neurophilosophy, but also on theoretical biology, evolution and complexity science. Moreover, it would give us a glimpse of how human and machine intelligence are destined to co-evolve in the future.\n\nPredictive brains\n\nThe idea that brains are essentially prediction machines isn’t new. German physicist and physician Hermann von Helmholtz advanced it in the nineteenth century in his Treatise on Physiological Optics (1867). The idea was developed further by the founders of cybernetics, especially US mathematician Norbert Wiener, in the early 1940s — a starting point of modern, neural-net-based AI research.\n\nWiener realized3 that all living systems have ‘purposive’ behaviours to stay alive, and that such actions require computational modelling. Our internal and external senses enable us to compute predictive models, both of ourselves and of our environment. But these are useful only if we can act to affect the future — specifically, to increase the odds that we will still be a thriving part of it. Evolution selects for entities that use predictions to make the best survival decisions. The actions we take, and the observations that ensue, become part of our past experience, creating a feedback loop that enables us to make further predictions.\n\nHunting is a prime example of this predictive modelling. A predator must predict actions that will get the prey into its stomach; the prey must predict the predator’s behaviour to stop that from happening. Starting in the 1970s, neuropsychologists and anthropologists began to realize that other intelligent entities are often the most important parts of the environment to model — because they are the ones modelling you back, whether with friendly or hostile intent4. Increasingly intelligent predators put evolutionary pressure on their prey to become smarter, and vice versa.\n\nThe hunting behaviour of whales is the product of a shared, social intelligence.Credit: Nick Garbutt/NaturePL\n\nThe pressures towards intelligence become even more intense for members of social species. Winning mates, sharing resources, gaining followers, teaching, learning and dividing labour: all of these involve modelling and predicting the minds of others. But the more intelligent you become — the better to predict the minds of others (at least in theory) — the more intelligent, and thus hard to predict, those others have also become, because they are of the same species and doing the same thing. These runaway dynamics produce ‘intelligence explosions’: the rapid evolutionary increases in brain size that have been observed in highly social animals, including bats, whales and dolphins, birds and our own ancestors.\n\nDuring a social intelligence explosion, individuals get smarter, but so do groups. Bigger brains can model more relationships, allowing groups to become larger while retaining social cohesion. Sharing and division of labour enable these larger social units to do much more than individuals can on their own.\n\nTake humans. Individually, we aren’t much smarter than our primate ancestors. Humans raised in the wild, like the fictional Mowgli in Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book (1894), would seem unexceptional relative to the forest’s other large-ish animals — if, indeed, they survive at all. But in large numbers, humans can achieve many improbably complex feats beyond any individual’s cognitive or physical capacity: transplanting organs, travelling to the Moon, manufacturing silicon chips. These feats require cooperation, thinking in parallel and division of labour. They are group-level phenomena, and can justifiably be called superhuman.\n\nSymbiogenic transitions\n\nWhat applies to human sociality arguably also applies to every previous major evolutionary transition throughout life’s history on Earth. These include the transition from simple prokaryotic cells to more-complex eukaryotic ones, from single-celled life to multicellular organisms, and from solitary insects to colony-dwellers. In each case, entities that previously led independent lives entered into a close symbiosis, dividing labour and working in parallel to create a super-entity5.\n\nAI language models killed the Turing test: do we even need a replacement?\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that this ‘symbiogenesis’ is much more common than has generally been supposed. Horizontal gene transfer between cells, the incorporation of a useful retroviral element into a host’s genome and symbiotic bacteria establishing themselves in an animal’s gut are commonplace examples that would not count as ‘major’ transitions. Yet they have certainly produced organisms with innovative capabilities. The ability of termites to digest wood, for instance, depends entirely on enzymes produced by symbiotic microorganisms. The formation of the placental barrier in humans depends on syncytin, a protein derived from the envelope of a retrovirus that fused into the mammalian germ line tens of millions of years ago.\n\nStandard Darwinian evolution, involving the familiar mechanisms of mutation and selection, has no intrinsic bias towards increasing complexity. It is this less familiar mechanism of symbiogenesis that gives evolution its arrow of time: life progresses from simple to more-complex forms when existing parts merge to form new super-entities. This process speeds up over time, as the catalogue of parts available to be combined afresh increases in size and sophistication. Over the past billion years, symbiogenesis has produced increasingly complex nervous systems, colonies of social animals — and eventually our own technological society.\n\nIs this nature’s version of Moore’s law? Yes and no. As originally formulated in 1965 by US engineer Gordon Moore, the co-founder of chip company Intel, the ‘law’ states that transistor size shrinks exponentially6. This translates into exponential declines in computer size, cost and power consumption, and exponential increases in operating speed.\n\nBiological cells have not become exponentially smaller or faster throughout evolution. The advent of electrically excitable neurons sometime around 650 million years ago introduced a fast new computational timescale, but that was a one-off: since then, neurons have not become faster or smaller, nor have their energetic requirements decreased. This does not obviously resemble Moore’s law as it played out in the twentieth century.\n\nWill AI ever win its own Nobel? Some predict a prize-worthy science discovery soon\n\nBut look at the law in the twenty-first century, and a connection becomes more apparent. Since around 2006, transistors have continued to shrink, but the rise in semiconductor operating speed has stalled. To keep increasing computer performance, chip-makers are instead adding more processing cores. They began, in other words, to parallelize silicon-based computation. It’s no coincidence that this is when modern, neural-net-based AI models finally began to take off. Practically speaking, neural nets require massively parallel processing; for a single modern processor to sequentially perform the trillion or so operations needed for a state-of-the-art large language model to predict the next token in a sequence would take minutes.\n\nThis starts to look a lot more like the story of biological intelligence. AI emerged not through speed alone, but from a division of labour arising from the cooperation of many simple computational elements running in parallel: what we might term technological symbiogenesis.\n\nIn this context, computer science is a natural science as well as an engineering discipline. Humans did not invent computation any more than they did electric current or optical lenses. We merely re-discovered a phenomenon nature had already exploited, developed mathematical theories to understand it better and worked out how to engineer it on a different substrate. Our phones, laptops and data centres could aptly be called ‘artificial computers’.\n\nComputogenesis\n\nIf symbiogenesis explains the evolution of natural computational complexity and the emergence of intelligence, how and why did nature first become computational? Work that I and colleagues have been doing on artificial life over the past couple of years helps to clarify this.\n\nTo set the scene, imagine an enormous variety of randomly configured feedback mechanisms that are simple enough to arise spontaneously in a thermally variable environment such as that of Earth. Now, assume that each of these mechanisms can work only within some narrow temperature range. After a while, the mechanisms that persist will be the ones that work as thermostats, maintaining their temperature within the right range, so that they can continue to operate. This thought experiment illustrates how purposive behaviour, oriented towards self-preservation — a kind of proto-life — can emerge from random initial conditions.\n\nEven a thermostat is, by definition, performing a computation: it implements a behaviour (turn the heat on or off) that is conditional on an information input (the temperature). Thus, a minimal kind of computation — perhaps nothing more than an ‘if … then’ operation — will arise and persist whenever the output can affect the likelihood of whatever is doing the computation continuing to exist.\n\nThis kind of simple operation is still a long way from a general-purpose computer, which was defined by English computing pioneer Alan Turing using a theoretical construct we refer to today as a universal Turing machine. It consists of a ‘head’ that can move left or right along a tape, reading, writing and erasing symbols on that tape according to a table of rules. Turing realized that a rule table can also be encoded as a sequence of symbols on the tape — what we’d now call a program. Certain rule tables exist that will cause the machine to read that program from the tape, performing any computation it specifies.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – For a long time, scientists thought true intelligence was something only living brains could have. Artificial intelligence (AI) was seen as limited, mostly able to do small tasks like predicting the next word in a sentence. But recent advances have changed that view.\n\n**What happened** – Over the past decade, AI models have grown much more powerful. Starting with early versions like Google’s Meena in 2019 and moving to more advanced ones like LaMDA, AI systems have begun to understand new ideas, tell jokes, solve problems, and respond to complex questions. Researchers now believe intelligence in both machines and living things comes from similar processes of computation and prediction.\n\n**Impact** – This idea connects the growth of AI with how intelligence evolved in nature. Living creatures became smarter over time by cooperating and predicting others’ actions, especially in social groups like humans or dolphins. This cooperation created more complex “super-organisms.” AI is following a similar path by combining many simple parts working together, like neurons in the brain. Understanding intelligence this way helps us see AI and humans as part of the same evolutionary story.\n\n**What’s next step** – Scientists will keep exploring how life became computational and how intelligence develops through cooperation and prediction. This research could lead to better AI systems that work alongside humans, and also deepen our knowledge of biology and brain science.

      "content": "Quantum theory fails to explain how the reality we experience emerges from the world of particles. A new take on quantum cause and effect could bridge the gap\n\nAdrià Voltà\n\nThe ball rolls across the floor because it was kicked, just as Earth orbits the sun because it is tugged by gravity. The connection between cause and effect is fundamental to how we understand the world – or at least, it is for the world we see, governed by classical physics.\n\nNotoriously, everything gets murkier in the underlying realm of atoms and subatomic particles described by quantum theory. But, as a fundamental physicist who develops algorithms to extract cause and effect from correlations, I have long believed that causality could help us solve the mystery at the heart of quantum mechanics: the confounding notion that quantum systems like electrons exist in a state of uncertainty until an observer measures them.\n\nThis is why I am intrigued by a fresh attempt to rid quantum theory of this so-called observer problem. Building on insights from existing interpretations and recently developed models of quantum causality, this new take uses the precise mathematics of cause and effect to show how interactions between and within quantum systems can determine which of the many possible ways they could change over time actually happen, without any reference to the mysterious power of observers.\n\nWhat it amounts to is a quietly radical rethink of reality. In this view, quantum causality is the most essential aspect of reality from which the cosmos springs. Remarkably, this view seems to resolve several quantum paradoxes in one fell swoop. Perhaps the biggest indication that it might be on the right track is that it could also provide a plausible route to the long-sought holy grail of physics: a theory that unifies quantum theory with Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity.\n\nA confusing theory\n\nQuantum mechanics is, without doubt, one of our most successful scientific theories. It describes the often counterintuitive behaviour of subatomic particles with incredible accuracy, precisely predicting the outcomes of countless experiments. It is also the source of endless confusion, however, because ever since it was first devised, it has resisted attempts to make sense of what it means for our understanding of reality.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Lost in Space-Time Untangle mind-bending physics, maths and the weirdness of reality with our monthly, special-guest-written newsletter. Sign up to newsletter\n\nOur frustrations boil down to the vagueness of the concept of “measurement” at the heart of the theory. Until we measure a particle, its properties are best described by the Schrödinger equation and its famous “wave function”, which paints those properties as a kind of fog of possible alternatives. This allows us to calculate the odds on which of them we will see when a particle is measured. But it can’t tell us the outcome of any measurement. Until we make one, all we have is probabilities.\n\nThe upshot is that the observer who performs the measurement is all-important. The gnawing problem is that it isn’t at all clear what qualifies as an observer. With no precise definition, quantum theory offers no answer to the key question of how and why the world we see – where particles have definite properties – emerges from the quantum fog.\n\nIn the reality we experience, one thing always leads to another Sibylle Pietrek/Plain Picture\n\nThat’s why many physicists view quantum theory as it is typically understood to be deeply unsatisfying. “The current situation with quantum mechanics is that it’s a theory that predicts very well and explains very badly,” says Nick Ormrod at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. We can’t just fall back on the phrase “because we measure it”, he says, particularly as many suspect that the vagueness of quantum theory is a big part of why physicists struggle to apply it in contexts where no observers are present, such as the very early universe or the fabric of space-time.\n\nWhat we require, then, is an interpretation that removes the need for observers. In fact, we already have several on the table (see “The meaning of quantum theory”, below). And while they are imperfect, Ormrod and his colleague Jonathan Barrett at the University of Oxford wondered if two of them might be refined to build a more coherent, observer-independent take on quantum theory.\n\nConsistent histories\n\nThe first of those proposals is known as the consistent histories interpretation, which was developed in the 1980s. Rather than treating measurement as a special process, it instead focuses on all the ways a quantum system could feasibly evolve over time – in other words, what happens between measurements. It identifies sequences of properties that the system (that is, a set of particles, for example) could have at different times, known as “histories”, and assigns probabilities to them, so long as they are internally consistent, meaning they can be calculated according to the standard rules of logic and classical probability. Crucially, and somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that all quantum phenomena can be modelled this way: there is no need for measurement or observers.\n\nIn this view, the act of measurement is just one way of accessing a history, seemingly removing its mysterious power to select an outcome from quantum uncertainty. But there is a catch: there isn’t just one consistent history a quantum system could follow, but many. The framework doesn’t contain anything that tells us which represents the properties the system really had at any given time, which means it doesn’t explain why we get the world we see. “You have to just sort of choose the right one and that choice feels a bit ad hoc,” says Ormrod.\n\nThe second interpretation, known as relational quantum mechanics, developed in the 1990s, is simpler to state: the properties of a quantum system exist only at the point of its interaction with another such system. This means that any physical system can act as an observer and, more importantly, that reality isn’t absolute, but is relative to the observer – whether people or particles. Think, for example, of a sunset: it only makes sense to talk about a sunset if we acknowledge it as something observed by a particular person in a certain position on Earth’s surface. In that sense, a sunset is relative. In the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics, every aspect of reality must be seen in a similar light.\n\nThe problem with this view, according to Ormrod, is that it lacks the sort of precisely defined mathematical framework required to properly scrutinise it. I agree with him. There is currently no formalism that provides a clear-cut definition of ambiguous notions such as “interaction” and “relative”. As such, it isn’t obvious exactly what relational quantum mechanics tells us about reality, or how it might change the way we approach efforts to construct a coherent theory of quantum gravity.\n\nWhich is where cause and effect comes in. Now, you might think it seems odd to apply classical notions of how things influence each other to the quantum world, which doesn’t play by the same rules. But to me, and to some other physicists, it has always made sense given that causal reasoning possesses extraordinary explanatory power. “You can’t do physics without using cause and effect,” says Robin Lorenz, a researcher in causality and quantum computing at Quantinuum. “Causality is the bread and butter of the sciences.” What’s more – and this is vital – these days, we have a better understanding of how cause and effect operate in the quantum regime.\n\nWhat Ormrod and Barrett realised is that we can marry the tantalising insights from the consistent histories interpretation and relational quantum mechanics, then overcome their flaws by underpinning them with recently developed models of quantum causality – and by elevating those causal structures to fundamental status.\n\nA new interpretation of quantum theory sees reality as being made up of “causal bubbles” MICHAL CIZEK/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a paper released in 2024, they showed that if we consider quantum systems as a network of “causal bubbles” with specific mathematical rules for how subsystems within a bubble influence one another, the “correct” sequence of properties a given bubble has or had over time naturally emerges. In other words, the causal structure of the system determines how it evolves – that is, what properties it has at any given moment – in a way that matches what we would predict with standard quantum theory, but without needing to appeal to the mysterious powers of external observers. “By analysing a quantum causal structure, you can always derive a unique set of consistent histories,” says Ormrod.\n\nTruly grasping the appeal of this model requires some advanced mathematical skills. To get a sense of what it amounts to, however, Ormrod suggests thinking of a spider’s web. The spider doesn’t begin with a set of points and connect them with threads. Rather, it begins with the threads, laying them down one after another – and where they interact, points form.\n\nThe key thing is that points in the spider’s web aren’t fundamental. They are by-products of how the threads are woven. “The points only exist because of the pieces of thread,” says Ormrod. “They emerge from the threads. The threads are actually the conceptually fundamental thing.”\n\nIn the same way, Ormrod and Barrett suggest, causation is the fundamental “thread” from which quantum reality emerges. The properties of particles are the points, the places where causal influences interact. But the causal structure – the threads – comes first. The properties of a quantum system – what we might call reality – emerge from causality, rather than from the mysterious and ill-defined process of measurement.\n\nThe paradox of Wigner’s friend\n\nIn any case, there are already reasons to think they are onto something with this new interpretation, which is sufficiently novel that it doesn’t yet have a name. One is that it can resolve a troubling conundrum that has, in recent years, brought the observer problem into sharper focus. First devised as a thought experiment and later recreated with particles in the lab, the Wigner’s friend paradox demonstrates that two observers – Wigner observing his friend making measurements on a quantum system in a lab from the outside – can have two contradictory experiences of reality. The implication is that quantum theory insists there is no such thing as objective, observer-independent reality, and renders the standard interpretation extremely problematic.\n\nIn Ormrod and Barrett’s framework, the Wigner’s friend paradox dissolves. The key is that the notion of a “definite outcome” is tied to causal structure, not to observation. Inside the lab, the friend is embedded in one causal bubble: the particle influences the apparatus, which influences their sensory experience. Within that causal bubble, the outcome is definite. From outside, however, Wigner is in a different causal bubble. What we learn from Ormrod and Barrett’s take on quantum theory is that, in this scenario, the friend’s measurement exerts a quantum influence on Wigner’s outcome, which precludes it from being part of the consistent history in his causal bubble. Relative to the bubble that includes Wigner’s outcome, the friend doesn’t obtain any measurement outcome at all.\n\nIn other words, both perspectives are correct, but are relative to their causal bubbles. There is no contradiction, because “definiteness” isn’t an absolute fact about the world, but a relational fact about causal structures. By making causation, not observation, the foundation, the framework elegantly sidesteps the need to favour one viewpoint. Realising that their framework resolved this paradox “was an amazing moment”, says Ormrod.\n\nThe other reason to take this new interpretation seriously has to do with the possibility of applying it to fundamental questions about the universe. The thing is, the notion that causality might be more fundamental than the entities it relates to also plays a role in our understanding of general relativity, which casts gravity as the result of mass warping space-time. There is a classic discovery from the 1970s that shows that if you know the causal structure of space-time – roughly, which points can influence which others – you can reconstruct its geometry, distances and even the flow of time. “Causation is playing a very important role in shaping space-time structure,” says Ormrod.\n\nHow space-time emerges\n\nThis means space–time itself may be thought of as emerging from causal order. With that in mind, physicists seeking to reconcile quantum theory and general relativity to form a quantum theory of gravity have long speculated that the universe’s deepest layer may be a causal network, from which both geometry and matter emerge. If this is correct, Ormrod and Barrett’s interpretation is even more striking. On the quantum side, they show how the properties of a quantum system emerge naturally from causal structure. On the relativity side, causal structure already underpins space-time geometry. Taken together, the suggestion is tantalising: what if causality is the common root of both pillars of modern physics, and a foundation on which to unify them?\n\nOther attempts to unite quantum mechanics and relativity have taken very different routes. String theory, for example, imagines the fundamental building blocks as vibrating strings in higher dimensions. It is a bold idea that has inspired decades of research, but it has yet to deliver a complete, testable theory. What makes the causal approach appealing is its simplicity. Instead of inventing exotic new entities, it asks whether the familiar idea of cause and effect could be the missing foundation. If space-time and the properties of quantum systems both emerge from causality, then perhaps cooking up a viable theory of quantum gravity is less about discovering new ingredients and more about rearranging the ingredients we already have. “It seems highly suggestive that we’ve got these two similar emergence stories in the two theories that we’re attempting to unify,” says Ormrod.\n\nFor now, this is just informed speculation. But what we have with Ormrod and Barrett’s new interpretation is the outline of a framework that offers a bold answer to quantum theory’s greatest mystery: not just how the theory predicts outcomes, but why those outcomes occur.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Quantum theory explains the tiny particles that make up everything but struggles to show how the clear world we see comes from these uncertain particles. One big problem is that the theory depends on an 'observer' measuring particles to decide their state, which leaves many questions unanswered.\n\n**What happened** – Two physicists, Nick Ormrod and Jonathan Barrett, combined ideas from earlier interpretations of quantum mechanics with new models of quantum cause and effect. They created a new way to understand how particles change over time based on a network of \"causal bubbles\"—where cause and effect relationships decide what happens, without needing an observer. This removes the mystery of measurement and explains how definite outcomes arise naturally.\n\n**Impact** – This new view solves confusing paradoxes like the Wigner’s friend problem, where two observers seem to see different realities. It shows that outcomes depend on their causal connections, not on who watches. Also, since cause and effect is important in Einstein’s theory of gravity, this idea might help unite quantum theory and relativity, a goal scientists have sought for decades.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will explore this causal framework further to see if it can fully explain quantum behavior and merge it with gravity. This could lead to a clearer, unified understanding of the universe’s smallest and largest parts.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – By making cause and effect the foundation of quantum theory, scientists have taken a key step toward solving its biggest puzzles and linking it with gravity.\n",

Ils ont créé une nouvelle façon de comprendre comment les particules changent au fil du temps, basée sur un réseau de « bulles causales » — où les relations de cause à effet décident ce qui arrive, sans avoir besoin d’un observateur.

De plus, puisque la cause à effet est importante dans la théorie de la gravité d’Einstein, cette idée pourrait aider à unir la théorie quantique et la relativité, un objectif recherché depuis des décennies.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs vont approfondir ce cadre causal pour voir s’il peut expliquer complètement le comportement quantique et le fusionner avec la gravité.

Participants will develop skills across the entire development pipeline, from designing components and studying how light interacts with matter to improving high-power amplification and advancing practical applications.\n\nPreparing Future Experts in Photonics\n\n\"Our Doctoral Network is about shaping the next generation of scientists and innovators in photonics,\" says Dr. Regina Gumenyuk, Project Coordinator at Tampere University.\n\nGumenyuk notes that the network will support the creation of new products and more efficient processes, including innovations in optical components and nanofabrication. She also highlights anticipated environmental benefits linked to a circular economy approach. Another goal is to decrease the use of hazardous chemicals and reduce the size and energy demand of hardware by applying advanced predictive technologies for high-power vortices.\n\n\"High-power optical vortices are not only fascinating from a fundamental perspective but also hold the potential to transform applications from precision manufacturing to high-resolution imaging,\" adds Professor Goëry Genty from Tampere University.\n\nA Europe-Wide Partnership for Photonics Innovation\n\nThe HiPOVor network brings together universities, industrial collaborators and research institutions throughout Europe to support innovation and knowledge exchange in photonics.\n\nThe project is scheduled to begin on January 1, 2026. The consortium features eight leading academic institutions specializing in structured light and high-power laser technology, the Extreme Light Infrastructure -- Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) that is the world's most power laser facility, and nine industrial partners.\n\nMSCA is part of Horizon Europe and is the European Union's primary funding program for doctoral and postdoctoral researcher training.",
