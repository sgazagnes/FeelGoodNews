      "content": "Scientists have developed a compact Raman imaging system that can reliably tell cancerous tissue apart from normal tissue. The approach could support earlier cancer detection and help move advanced molecular imaging tools beyond research laboratories and into more practical clinical settings.\n\nThe imaging system is designed to detect extremely weak signals from surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles that are engineered to attach to tumor markers. Once these nanoparticles are applied to a sample or to the area being examined, the system reads their Raman signal and automatically highlights regions that are more likely to contain tumor tissue.\n\n\"Traditional methods for cancer-related diagnosis are time-consuming and labor-intensive because they require staining tissue samples and having a pathologist look for any abnormalities,\" said research team leader Zhen Qiu from the Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering (IQ), Michigan State University. \"While our system would not immediately replace pathology, it could serve as a rapid screening tool to accelerate diagnosis.\"\n\nPublished results show major gains in sensitivity\n\nIn Optica, Optica Publishing Group's journal for high-impact research, Qiu and colleagues report that their system can distinguish cancerous cells from healthy ones while detecting Raman signals that are about four times weaker than those measured by a comparable commercial system. This improved sensitivity comes from combining a swept-source laser -- which changes wavelength during analysis -- with an ultra-sensitive detector called a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD).\n\n\"This technology could eventually enable portable or intraoperative devices that enable clinicians to detect cancers at earlier stages, improve the accuracy of biopsy sampling and monitor disease progression through less invasive testing,\" said Qiu. \"Ultimately, such advances could enhance patient outcomes and reduce diagnostic delays, accelerating the path from detection to treatment.\"\n\nPushing detection limits with superconducting detectors\n\nQiu's lab studies how SNSPDs can be used to enhance a range of imaging technologies. SNSPDs rely on a superconducting wire that can detect individual particles of light, allowing the system to capture extremely weak optical signals at high speed while keeping background noise very low.\n\nFor this project, the researchers aimed to build a platform that could measure Raman signals far fainter than those detected by existing Raman systems. Raman imaging works by mapping a sample's chemical composition through the unique light-scattering fingerprints of its molecules. These signals can be strengthened by using SERS nanoparticles.\n\n\"Combining this advanced detector with a swept-source Raman architecture that replaces a bulky camera and collects light more efficiently resulted in a system with a detection limit well beyond that of comparable commercial systems,\" said Qiu. \"Also, the fiber coupling configuration and compact design facilitate system miniaturization and future clinical translation.\"\n\nStrong tumor contrast across multiple sample types\n\nTo test the system, the team used SERS nanoparticles coated with hyaluronan acid, which enables the particles to bind to CD44, a surface protein found on many tumor cells. Initial experiments with simple nanoparticle solutions showed that the system could reach femtomolar sensitivity. The researchers then applied the imaging platform to cultured breast cancer cells, mouse tumors, and healthy tissue samples.\n\n\"The SERS signals were strongly concentrated in tumor samples, with only minimal background detected in healthy tissue,\" said Qiu. \"This demonstrates both the system's exceptional sensitivity and its ability to provide reliable tumor-versus-healthy contrast. Moreover, by adjusting or substituting the targeting molecule, this method could be adapted for other cancer types.\"\n\nNext steps toward clinical use\n\nAccording to the researchers, additional work is needed before the system can be used in clinical settings. Future improvements will focus on increasing readout speed and expanding validation studies. The team is exploring faster laser sources, including VCSELs, and testing whether narrowing the sweep range can further improve performance. They also plan multiplexing experiments that use different nanoparticles to target multiple biomarkers at the same time.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge industry collaborator Quantum Opus, which provided the SNSPD devices used in this work.",

      "summary": "A deadly hospital fungus that resists nearly every antifungal drug may have an unexpected weakness. Researchers discovered that Candida auris activates specific genes during infection to hunt for nutrients it needs to survive. This insight came from a new living-host model that allowed scientists to watch the fungus in action. The findings could eventually lead to new treatments or allow current drugs to be repurposed.",
      "content": "Scientists have identified a genetic mechanism that could point to new ways of treating a rare but deadly fungal infection that has forced multiple hospital intensive care units to shut down. The finding offers early hope against a pathogen that has been difficult to control and nearly impossible to treat once it spreads.\n\nCandida auris is especially dangerous for people who are already critically ill, leaving hospitals highly exposed to outbreaks. Although the fungus can exist on the skin without causing symptoms, patients who depend on ventilators face a much greater risk. Once infection occurs, about 45 percent of patients die, and the fungus is resistant to all major types of antifungal drugs. This resistance makes treatment extremely challenging and allows the pathogen to persist in hospital wards.\n\nA global health threat with mysterious origins\n\nThe infection was first detected in 2008, and its origin is still unknown. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in more than 40 countries, including the UK. Candida auris, also called Candidozyma auris, is now recognized as a serious global health threat and appears on the World Health Organization's critical priority fungal pathogens list. In the UK, reported cases have continued to rise steadily.\n\nStudying infection in a living model\n\nResearchers at the University of Exeter have now taken a major step forward by examining how genes are activated during Candida auris infection. This marks the first time such genetic activity has been studied in a living host using an approach based on fish larvae. The study was published in the Nature portfolio journal Communications Biology and was supported by Wellcome, the Medical Research Council (MRC), and the National Center for Replacement, Reduction and Refinement (NC3Rs).\n\nThe researchers say the results could help identify a biological target for new antifungal treatments or even allow existing drugs to be reused, if the same genetic behavior is confirmed during infection in humans.\n\nThe project was co-led by NIHR Clinical Lecturer Hugh Gifford of the University of Exeter's MRC Center for Medical Mycology (CMM). He said: \"Since it emerged, Candida auris has wreaked havoc where it takes hold in hospital intensive care units. It can be deadly for vulnerable patients, and health trusts have spent millions on the difficult job of eradication. We think our research may have revealed an Achilles heel in this lethal pathogen during active infection, and we urgently need more research to explore whether we can find drugs that target and exploit this weakness.\"\n\nWhy traditional research models fell short\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles in studying Candida auris has been its ability to survive high temperatures. When combined with its unusually strong tolerance for salt, this has led some researchers to suggest it may have originated in tropical oceans or marine animals. These traits also made it difficult to study using conventional laboratory models.\n\nTo overcome this, the Exeter team developed a new infection model using Arabian killifish. The eggs of this species can survive at temperatures similar to the human body, making them suitable for observing infection in conditions that closely resemble real illness.\n\nGenetic activity reveals possible vulnerabilities\n\nDuring the experiments, researchers observed that Candida auris can change its shape by forming elongated fungal structures known as filaments. These structures may help the fungus search for nutrients while infecting a host.\n\nThe team also analyzed which genes were activated or switched off during infection to identify possible weak points. Several of the genes that became active are responsible for producing nutrient pumps that capture iron-scavenging molecules and transport iron into fungal cells. Because iron is essential for survival, this process may represent a critical vulnerability.\n\nCo-senior author Dr. Rhys Farrer of the University of Exeter's MRC Centre for Medical Mycology said: \"Until now, we've had no idea what genes are active during infection of a living host. We now need to find out if this also occurs during human infection. The fact that we found genes are activated to scavenge iron gives clues to where Candida auris may originate, such as an iron-poor environment in the sea. It also gives us a potential target for new and already existing drugs.\"\n\nHope for future treatments\n\nDr. Gifford, who also works as a resident physician in intensive care and respiratory medicine at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital, emphasized the clinical importance of the findings. He said: \"While there are a number of research steps to go through yet, our finding could be an exciting prospect for future treatment. We have drugs that target iron scavenging activities. We now need to explore whether they could be repurposed to stop Candida auris from killing humans and closing down hospital intensive care units.\"\n\nThe Arabian killifish larvae model was developed with support from an NC3Rs project grant as an alternative to using mouse and zebrafish models, which are commonly used to study interactions between pathogens and their hosts. Dr. Katie Bates, NC3Rs Head of Research Funding, said: \"This new publication demonstrates the utility of the replacement model to study Candida auris infection and enable unprecedented insights into cellular and molecular events in live infected hosts. This is a brilliant example of how innovative alternative approaches can overcome key limitations of traditional animal studies.\"\n\nThe paper is titled 'Xenosiderophore transporter gene expression and clade-specific filamentation in Candida auris killifish (Aphanius dispar) infection' and is published in the Nature portfolio journal Communications Biology.",

      "content": "An experimental gene therapy seems to slow the progression of Huntington’s disease by about 75 per cent, and researchers are working to make its complicated delivery much more practical\n\nHuntington’s disease gradually kills brain cells, affecting movement, mood and thinking Science Photo Library/Alamy\n\nThis year marked a pivotal moment in the quest to treat Huntington’s disease, a rare but devastating form of dementia. Scientists found that an experimental gene therapy slowed the condition’s progression – the first time this has ever been achieved. Although a huge feat, delivering the therapy is challenging, so researchers are already working on a more practical intervention.\n\n“It is a giant step forward,” says team member Sarah Tabrizi at University College London, referring to the existing therapy’s success in a late-stage trial earlier this year. “It tells you that Huntington’s disease has the potential to be treatable. This gives us a huge window of opportunity.”\n\nHuntington’s disease occurs due to a genetic mutation that causes the normally harmless huntingtin protein to accumulate in toxic clumps inside the brain. Over time, this kills brain cells, leading to difficulties with movement, thinking and mood. There are no approved treatments that stop symptoms from worsening, with interventions instead focusing on supporting people through the process.\n\nBut the experimental therapy, known as AMT-130, targets these abnormal proteins by carrying genetic instructions to brain cells, directing them to make a molecule that blocks their production.\n\nIn the trial, Tabrizi and her colleagues gave 17 people with Huntington’s disease a high dose of the treatment, then compared their cognition, movement and daily functioning with those of untreated individuals three years later. The drug’s developer, biotechnology company uniQure, shared preliminary results in September, which showed the treatment slowed the condition’s progression by about 75 per cent, on average.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“We have had so many setbacks in therapies for Huntington’s disease in the last couple of years,” says Sarah O’Shea at Mount Sinai in New York, who wasn’t involved in the research. “So this was huge, not just because it is a breakthrough in terms of slowing disease progress, but also [because] it came at a time where we really needed this hope.”\n\nYet the treatment isn’t without its setbacks. It is delivered deep into the brain over a 12-to-18-hour surgery – an operation only a few facilities are capable of, even in countries like the US and the UK, says Tabrizi. What’s more, if it were approved for use, it would almost certainly come with an exorbitant price tag. “So, do I think it is going to be able to get to everyone? It is going to be challenging,” she says.\n\nTo get around this, she and her colleagues have since developed a similar treatment that is injected into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord. “That is currently in a phase I study. We dosed the first patient in November 2024,” says Tabrizi, noting that the results, which should inform us about the approach’s safety, are expected around July 2026.\n\nIn the meantime, uniQure executives said in September that they planned to submit AMT-130 to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval in early 2026. But in a statement in November, they said the submission timeline was now unclear after the FDA expressed reservations about the study’s design, particularly its makeshift control group, which was made up of individuals from a database of people with Huntington’s who received no intervention.\n\nThe lack of a control group within the trial makes it difficult to know the degree to which the placebo effect may have influenced the results. But the invasive nature of the surgery makes it difficult to justify creating such a group.\n\n“We strongly believe that AMT-130 has the potential to bring substantial benefit to patients, and we remain fully committed to working with the FDA to determine the best path forward to rapidly bring AMT-130 to patients and their families in the US,” Matt Kapusta, CEO of uniQure, said in the statement.",

The discovery sheds light on human empathy and opens doors for new brain-based therapies and AI systems that better understand the body.",
      "content": "In a global research collaboration, neuroscientists Nicholas Hedger (University of Reading) and Tomas Knapen (Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience & Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) set out to better understand how humans experience the world. Their work revealed how the brain converts visual information into sensations of touch, helping create a lived, physical sense of reality. As Knapen notes, \"This aspect of human experience is a fantastic area for AI development.\"\n\nPicture yourself cooking with a friend when they suddenly cut their finger. Almost instantly, you might wince, make a face, or even pull your own hand away. These reactions happen within milli-seconds and are not imagined. They reflect real activity in your brain's touch-processing region, known as the somatosensory cortex.\n\nThis raises a fascinating question. How can simply watching someone else trigger your own sense of touch?\n\nStudying Touch Through Movies\n\nTo investigate this mystery, researchers from the UK, USA, and VU, NIN (KNAW) in Amsterdam turned to an unexpected tool: Hollywood films. Instead of controlled lab tasks, they analyzed how the brain responds during natural viewing experiences.\n\nTomas Knapen (last author) and Nicholas Hedger (first author) worked with a dataset in which participants lay in brain scanners while watching movie clips from films such as The Social Network and Inception. The researchers aimed to use these recordings to pinpoint the brain systems that allow us to deeply experience what we see.\n\nMapping the Body in the Brain\n\nWhen scientists refer to \"maps\" in the brain, they are describing how different regions organize information about the body and surrounding space. In the somatosensory cortex, the entire body is laid out in an orderly way. One end processes sensations from the feet, while the other handles touch from the head. These maps help the brain identify where sensations originate.\n\nFinding comparable maps in the visual cortex is especially exciting. It suggests that the brain connects visual input directly to bodily sensation, linking sight and touch at a fundamental level.\n\n\"We found not one, or two, but eight remarkably similar maps in the visual cortex!\" Knapen explains. \"Finding so many shows how strongly the visual brain speaks the language of touch.\"\n\nThese visual maps follow the same head-to-toe organization seen in the somatosensory cortex -- indicating that when we look at another person, the brain structures that information in much the same way it does when we physically feel something ourselves.\n\nWhy the Brain Uses Multiple Maps\n\nIf there are so many body maps, what purpose do they serve? According to the researchers, each map appears to support a different function. Some are more focused on recognizing specific body parts, while others help determine where those parts are located in space. \"I think that there are many more purposes, but we just haven't been able to test them yet.\" Knapen adds.\n\nWhich map becomes most active can depend on what you are paying attention to. \"Say you stand up and grab a cup of coffee. If I'm interested in what you're doing, I will probably focus on your hand grabbing the cup. Now imagine that I'm more interested in your emotional state. In that case, I might focus more on your overall posture or your facial expressions. Every time you look at a person, there are many different bodily translations that need to be conducted visually. We think that these maps are a fundamental ingredient in that exact process.\"\n\nAlthough having overlapping maps might sound inefficient, Knapen argues the opposite. \"This allows the brain to have many types of information in a single space, and make a translation in any way that is relevant in that moment,\" he explains.\n\nImplications for Psychology Medicine and Technology\n\nThe discovery opens the door to a wide range of future studies. Because these body maps appear to play a role in emotional understanding, they may help advance research in social psychology and clinical care. \"People with autism can struggle with this sort of processing. Having this information could help us better identify effective treatments,\" Knapen explains.\n\nOver time, the findings could also influence the development of neurotechnology. \"Training sets for brain implants often start off with instructions like 'try to think of a movement'. If these bodily processes can be activated in much broader ways, then there might be much broader possibilities to train and develop those brain computer interfaces.\"\n\nKnapen also sees major potential for artificial intelligence. \"Our bodies are deeply intertwined with our experiences and understanding of the world. Current AI primarily relies on text and video, lacking this bodily dimension. This aspect of human experience is a fantastic area for AI development. Our work shows the potential for very large, precision brain imaging datasets to fuel this development: a beautiful synergy between neuroscience and AI.\"\n\nDespite these future possibilities, Knapen emphasizes that the core motivation remains deeply human. \"I just want to understand the depths of the human experience, and it really feels like we just found this central ingredient for it.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – When we watch someone move, get hurt, or show feelings, our brain doesn’t just see it; it partly feels it too. This happens because the brain has special areas that process touch. Until now, scientists were unsure how seeing someone else could create a sense of touch in our own brain.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from the UK, USA, and the Netherlands studied how the brain reacts when people watch movie clips inside brain scanners. They found eight body-like maps in the visual part of the brain. These maps organize what we see in the same way the brain arranges touch sensations. For example, some maps focus on body parts while others help locate these parts in space.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows that our brain connects sight and touch closely, explaining how we can almost feel what others feel. It helps us understand empathy better and could improve treatments for people who find it hard to read others’ emotions, like those with autism. It also opens new paths for brain technology and smarter artificial intelligence that understands the body better.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists want to explore more about how each of these eight maps works and how they help us understand people around us. Their research could lead to better brain-based therapies and new ways to train brain-computer devices. AI developers might use these findings to create machines that experience the world more like humans do.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Researchers found eight body maps in the brain’s visual area that link what we see to how we feel touch, helping explain empathy and offering new possibilities for medicine and technology.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Lorsque nous regardons quelqu’un bouger, se blesser ou montrer des émotions, notre cerveau ne fait pas que voir, il ressent aussi en partie. Cela se produit parce que le cerveau possède des zones spéciales qui traitent le toucher. Jusqu’à présent, on ne comprenait pas comment regarder quelqu’un d’autre pouvait créer cette sensation de toucher dans notre propre cerveau.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs du Royaume-Uni, des États-Unis et des Pays-Bas ont étudié comment le cerveau réagit lorsque des personnes regardent des extraits de films dans un scanner cérébral. Ils ont découvert huit cartes corporelles dans la partie visuelle du cerveau. Ces cartes organisent ce que nous voyons de la même façon que le cerveau organise les sensations tactiles. Par exemple, certaines cartes se concentrent sur des parties du corps, d’autres aident à localiser ces parties dans l’espace.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte montre que notre cerveau relie étroitement la vue et le toucher, expliquant comment nous pouvons presque ressentir ce que les autres ressentent. Elle aide à mieux comprendre l’empathie et pourrait améliorer les traitements pour les personnes qui ont du mal à lire les émotions des autres, comme celles atteintes d’autisme. Elle ouvre aussi de nouvelles voies pour la technologie cérébrale et une intelligence artificielle plus intelligente qui comprend mieux le corps.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – Les scientifiques veulent explorer davantage comment chacune de ces huit cartes fonctionne et comment elles nous aident à comprendre les gens autour de nous. Leur recherche pourrait conduire à de meilleurs traitements basés sur le cerveau et de nouvelles façons d’entraîner les dispositifs cerveau-ordinateur. Les développeurs d’IA pourraient utiliser ces découvertes pour créer des machines qui perçoivent le monde plus comme les humains.\n\n**Phrase clé** – Les chercheurs ont trouvé huit cartes corporelles dans la zone visuelle du cerveau qui lient ce que nous voyons à la sensation de toucher, aidant à expliquer l’empathie et offrant de nouvelles possibilités pour la médecine et la technologie.",
