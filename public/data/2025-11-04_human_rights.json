      "title": "In a quiet community on Doha’s edge, Gaza’s wounded and orphaned learn to heal",
      "summary": "In the late afternoon light, about 20 kilometres from Doha, the Al-Thumama complex looks like any quiet residential neighbourhood: paved pathways, rows of apartment blocks, the hum of air-conditioning carrying through the warm desert air. ",
      "content": "When Annalena Baerbock, President of the UN General Assembly (PGA), visited the complex on Monday afternoon, the sun was beginning to soften over a place that has been transformed. UN News accompanied the visit, observing her meetings with families, children and the staff supporting them.\n\nOnce built to host football fans during the 2022 World Cup, it now functions as an emergency housing and medical rehabilitation centre, with living quarters, a 24-hour primary health centre, physiotherapy and prosthetic rehabilitation units, counselling and social support spaces, and buildings repurposed for children’s activities.\n\nAl-Thumama shelters between 1,700 and 2,000 evacuees from Gaza, including more than 700 children – many of them orphans now in the care of relatives or guardians who accompanied them from the Strip. The complex was originally built to accommodate 1,500 people.\n\nMany residents are also undergoing medical treatment, ranging from surgery to long-term rehabilitation and prosthetics. “Everyone who arrived here was diagnosed with PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder],” Sheikha Al Jufairi, a member of the Qatar Social Work Foundation, told the PGA.\n\nUN News/Abdelmonem Makki Assembly President Baerbock (centre) speaks to a young girl at the complex.\n\nSimply being children\n\nAs the briefing concluded, several women and children entered the room to greet the delegation. One girl wore a sweatshirt printed with the word “Brooklyn”. Ms. Baerbock smiled and told her, “I’m from New York – where Brooklyn is,” prompting shy laughter.\n\nNearby, a small girl in a white floral dress, hair tied neatly with a ribbon and golden shoes that caught the light, leaned gently into Ms. Baerbock’s side as they posed for a photo together. She moved with a slight limp, but her expression was all joy – present in the moment, simply being a child.\n\nA grandmother sat nearby, carrying a boy not yet three years old, tall for his age. His right arm was amputated, and on his left remained only a single index finger, his small hands marked by the deep scars of war and medical treatment.\n\nUN News/Abdelmonem Makki Assembly President Baerbock (left) speaks with a young boy, Ramadan.\n\nThen, a boy of about twelve or thirteen stepped forward – neatly dressed in a turquoise button-down shirt and dark trousers, composed and confident beyond his years.\n\nHe explained that he had written a book – A Biography of Childhood and Heroism: Memoirs of a Child from Gaza. He presented a copy to Ms. Baerbock, who asked him to write his name inside. She told him: “I am taking your name, Ramadan, so I can tell the story about the strong children from Gaza, the brightest children I’ve met.”\n\nAfter the visit, Ms. Baerbock – who is in Doha to attend the UN World Summit for Social Development – said the encounter underscored the stakes for the future.\n\n“Speaking to children, speaking to families at the Al-Thumama complex underlined how important it is not only to reconstruct Gaza, but to give support to a traumatized generation – children who have lost everything, their mothers, their fathers, relatives and friends, their arms, their legs, but still keep on fighting and wishing for a final future in peace.”\n\nUN News/Abdelmonem Makki A woman adds the finishing touches a flower-shaped rug at the complex.\n\nA heart and a sunflower\n\nAfter the meeting, Ms. Baerbock stepped out and crossed the street to an off-white building opposite. Inside, staff from the Qatar Red Crescent run mental health and psychosocial support services.\n\nInside the first room, a woman was working with a long strand of wool, guiding it through a handheld device to embroider a heart shape onto a carpet mat.\n\nCoincidentally, the yarn matched the deep tone of the dress Ms. Baerbock was wearing. Nearby were two completed pieces: one a pink-and-white sunflower, the other a cheerful multicoloured one, the sort a child might draw.\n\nUN News/Vibhu Mishra A woman embroiders a pattern on a fabric, tracing the image from a mobile phone.\n\nIn the next room, several older women sat together around a table, embroidering by hand. One had a mobile phone in front of her with a pattern. The woman’s hand deftly needled the thread through the fabric, tracing an emerald and violet flower. No one spoke loudly; the atmosphere was one of gentle concentration.\n\nA display case on the wall had small items the women had made: keychains, soft toys, and cloth purses – each arranged with care. Ms. Baerbock paused to speak with the women, who continued working as they chatted.\n\nAs she left the building, a small detail stood out: every entrance had both steps and a ramp – a reminder that many residents here are still learning to walk again, or move with assistance.\n\nOutside, an older woman in a wheelchair waited. From a bag, she offered small plates of homemade sweets to the PGA, who accepted one and thanked her. The exchange was brief, direct and warm.\n\nUN News/Vibhu Mishra Assembly President Baerbock (left) speaks with doctors at the complex's health clinic.\n\nPlease ring the bell\n\nA short walk away, another building housed a 24-hour primary health centre. Posters on the walls – on flu symptoms, vaccination reminders, and handwashing – could have been found in any clinic anywhere in the world.\n\nDoctors in scrubs greeted the delegation, explaining the kinds of treatments provided, and how it coordinates with other, more advanced medical centers in Doha.\n\nIn one room, a nurse sat at a standard check-up desk; in another, a treatment room held a rolling hospital bed, a blood pressure monitor, a thermometer, and an oxygen cylinder standing ready at the wall.\n\nNext door, the laboratory provided diagnostic services, and around the corner, a small pharmacy displayed a sign that read: “In case of emergency, please ring the bell.”\n\nThe ordinariness of the setting – the routine, the small objects, the soft-spoken interactions – stood in contrast to the extraordinary circumstances that brought everyone here.",

It is entirely preventable.”\n\nGeneral Assembly President Baerbock addresses the leaders meeting.\n\nAs the planet heats, insecurity spreads\n\nShe pointed in particular to climate change as a rapidly accelerating driver of food insecurity.\n\nDescribing farmlands in the Sahel turned to dust, she called it “the new frontline of food insecurity,” warning that unchecked global warming could push up to 1.8 billion more people into hunger.\n\nThe Global Alliance – launched under Brazil’s G20 Presidency in 2024 – now includes nearly 200 members, including national governments, regional bodies, international organizations and civil society groups.\n\nMonday’s meeting aimed to strengthen coordinated action, including expanding social protection, supporting rural livelihoods and investing in climate-resilient agriculture.\n\n“In a world of plenty – where there should be more than enough to go around – ensuring that everyone, everywhere has enough to eat is entirely possible,” Ms. Baerbock said. “A world free from hunger and poverty is not a distant aspiration.

      "summary": "Campaigners say IVF treatment should be less stigmatised in the workplace and come with legal entitlements to time off",
      "content": "Calls for legal right to paid leave for IVF treatment\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Share Save\n\nSUPPLIED Natalie Rowntree says both she and her husband have been using sick days to attend IVF appointments\n\nNatalie Rowntree from North Yorkshire has recently started her IVF journey, and describes the process as \"intense\". The 38-year-old has had seven IVF-related appointments in the space of eight weeks, including multiple blood tests, scans and X-rays, one of which left her in physical discomfort for \"a good few days\". As is the nature of fertility treatment, all of these appointments have to be done at very specific times of the month - and fitting this around her job at a private opticians has proven difficult. \"I've just been using sick days and holidays to go through these appointments,\" she says.\n\nAdded to this is the emotional toll of having to manage the process, with no entitlement to time off. Two years ago, Natalie had two miscarriages over a six month period and since then has not been able to conceive with her partner. \"The emotion side is quite difficult, and then trying to manage that around work...do I bite the bullet and explain what's happening? Or keep having sick days and holidays?\" she says.\n\nAccording to research from the social enterprise Fertility Matters at Work, Natalie is one of the around 63% of employees undergoing IVF who are taking sick leave to undergo treatment - with most citing they were doing so to hide their treatment from their employer. Now there are calls for women undergoing fertility treatments to have the legal right to paid time off to attend their appointments. Campaigners claim that while some employers offer fertility support, it is unequal and not guaranteed, and should be classed as a medical procedure. Becoming pregnant through IVF enables the same maternity rights as non-IVF pregnancies, but currently in employment law there are no legal rights when it comes to fertility treatment. According to new research by Fertility Matters at Work, that comes at a potential cost of millions to the economy and businesses in lost productivity.\n\nNatalie says she has avoided bringing her treatment up with her managers because she is nervous about the reception she might get for taking time off work to go through the process. \"If I was to go to my managers and say I was pregnant, I wouldn't feel nervous at all about that...but with this, because you don't know how long it's going to go on for, you can't give work a timescale.\" Employment guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission advises \"good practice\" to employers with workers seeking leave for IVF treatment, but it acknowledges that such requests are not covered by the protected characteristic of pregnancy and maternity in law. However, refusing to grant someone leave for fertility treatment could count as sex discrimination in certain situations - but campaigners say this is hard to prove.\n\n'Employers could benefit too'\n\nRebecca Kearns, from Fertility Matters at Work, co-founded the group with two other women after they all experienced their own difficulties undergoing IVF whilst trying to keep afloat in the workplace. The 39-year-old says providing time off would be a potential benefit of employers, who could save the economy millions in lost productivity. \"What we're finding is, because there's 63% taking sick leave, that is having an impact on businesses, there's a cost for the disruption of this absence.\" She also thinks employers need to be more aware of the toll IVF - which she considers a \"significant life event\" - can take on their employees. \"You often have a number of very short notice appointments you have to attend, it's very dependent on how your body is responding to medication. \"But we also know there's still a huge amount of stigma that surrounds IVF and infertility. \"We receive messages almost daily from people who are struggling with this experience...people taking sick leave to hide treatment, the fact that they're then triggered on absence procedures and potentially having their performance monitored. \"And it was all because they were going through fertility treatment and just felt unable to say that was what they were going through.\" She says women have also told them they have left jobs and signed non-disclosure agreements as a result of going through IVF.\n\nEMOTIVE EYE Rebecca Kearns also struggled while undergoing fertility treatment\n\nThe government says that while no specific legal right to time off for IVF treatment exists, it expects employers to treat staff fairly and accommodate reasonable requests. The government also says it is strengthening flexible working rules which will make it easier for employees to agree arrangements with their workplace for support. But that isn't enough reassurance for the Labour MP Alice MacDonald, who will be introducing the issue in Parliament via a ten minute rule bill, which proposes to put into law the legal right to time off for fertility appointments.\n\nLabour MP Alice MacDonald says her bill would introduce fairness into the workplace\n\nWhilst it is unlikely the issue becomes law without official government backing, she is seeking to get it \"firmly on the government's radar\". \"Many people, especially women, are impacted by this when you're trying to have a baby and through no fault of your own, you need that extra medical support, you don't have a right to time off to go to those appointments,\" she says. \"At a time when you are hoping that it's going to work, hoping it's going to be successful, finally be pregnant and have the baby you've wanted you've got another additional barrier which is with your employer. \"There are many employers who are supportive but you have to hope you've got one that understands and who will give you the time off. \"If it was clearly in law what your rights are we think it opens up that conversation and employers would have to have a policy.\"\n\n'Striking a balance'\n\nPatrick Milnes from the British Chambers of Commerce says there is a concern amongst businesses about the potential for \"over legislation\" in anticipation of the Employment Rights Bill in particular, which will seek to ease rules on flexible working. \"Small and medium businesses in particular have been talking to us about how concerned they are about navigating different types of legislative leave,\" he says. \"Most employers that we speak to are doing this kind of thing anyway as a matter of good practice. \"If you legislate, those processes can become more complicated it can become more burdensome, and actually in many instances it's easier to do these things on a case by case, ad hoc basis. \"There's a middle ground between having nothing at all and having a full legislated process that might be overwhelming in some instances.\"",

Currently, there is no legal right in the UK for paid time off for IVF treatment, causing stress and secrecy at work.\n\n**What happened** – Natalie Rowntree from North Yorkshire shared her experience of using sick days and holidays for seven IVF appointments in just eight weeks. Research from Fertility Matters at Work shows about 63% of employees having IVF take sick leave, often hiding the reason from employers. Campaigners, including Labour MP Alice MacDonald, are pushing for a law to give paid leave for IVF appointments, arguing it should be treated like other medical procedures.\n\n**Impact** – This issue is important because many people feel unable to talk openly about IVF at work, leading to emotional and financial stress.

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Beaucoup de personnes qui suivent un traitement de fécondation in vitro (FIV) rencontrent des difficultés à concilier leurs rendez-vous médicaux avec leur travail. Actuellement, au Royaume-Uni, il n’existe pas de droit légal à un congé payé pour la FIV, ce qui cause du stress et du secret au travail.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Natalie Rowntree, originaire du North Yorkshire, a raconté qu’elle utilisait ses jours de maladie et ses congés pour sept rendez-vous de FIV en huit semaines. Une étude de Fertility Matters at Work montre qu’environ 63 % des employés en FIV prennent des congés maladie, souvent sans révéler la raison à leur employeur. Des militants, dont la députée Alice MacDonald, demandent une loi pour garantir un congé payé lors des traitements de fertilité, considérés comme des soins médicaux.\n\n**Impact** – Ce sujet est important car beaucoup de personnes ont du mal à parler ouvertement de la FIV au travail, ce qui entraîne un stress émotionnel et financier. Les employeurs perdent aussi en productivité quand les employés prennent des congés maladie sans soutien. La campagne souligne la nécessité d’équité et d’une meilleure compréhension de la FIV comme un événement de vie important, aidant les salariés à gérer leur traitement sans crainte ni stigmatisation.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Alice MacDonald prévoit de présenter un projet de loi au Parlement pour créer un droit légal à un congé payé pour les traitements de fertilité. Bien que certains employeurs offrent déjà un soutien, une loi rendrait ce congé uniforme et clair. Les discussions continuent pour trouver un équilibre entre ces nouvelles règles et les préoccupations des entreprises.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Des militants militent pour qu’un congé payé lors des traitements de FIV devienne un droit légal, afin de réduire le stress et l’injustice au travail pour les personnes en parcours de fertilité.",

Una investigación de Fertility Matters at Work muestra que alrededor del 63 % de los empleados en tratamiento de FIV toman licencia por enfermedad, muchas veces sin contarle a sus empleadores la razón.

      "summary": "The UN World Health Organization (WHO) issued new guidance on Monday to help poorer nations cope with severe global funding cuts for essential medical services worldwide.",
      "content": "According to the UN health agency, healthcare aid from abroad is projected to see a decline of between 30 and 40 per cent this year, compared with 2023.\n\nTweet URL\n\nThis has already resulted in reductions of up to 70 per cent in key health services in some of the 108 low and middle-income countries that feature in a new WHO report.\n\nMore than 50 of these nations also reported job losses among health and care workers, the UN agency noted, a situation made worse by years of financial strain driven by inflation, sovereign debt repayments and a heavy reliance on outside support.\n\nAt risk are critical services such as maternal care, vaccination and disease surveillance in many low and middle-income countries, WHO has warned.\n\nLives lost\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that “sudden and unplanned cuts to aid” have already hit many countries hard, “costing lives and jeopardising hard-won health gains”.\n\nBut he added that now was the time for countries to transition away from “aid dependency” towards “sustainable self-reliance” by using domestic resources to focus on protecting the most vulnerable.\n\nSeveral countries are already taking action. Nigeria has increased its health budget by $200 million to offset external funding cuts, while Ghana has lifted a cap on excise tax revenues to boost its national health insurance fund by 60 per cent.\n\nWHO said such steps show that national leadership and global solidarity are crucial to sustaining health systems in a new era of constrained aid.\n\nTürk welcomes Australia’s first treaty with Indigenous Peoples\n\nTweet URL\n\nThe UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, welcomed Australia’s first formal treaty with Indigenous Peoples on Monday describing it as a “major step toward justice and equality” and a “significant occasion for all Australians.”\n\nPassed by legislators in the state of Victoria, the treaty establishes a democratically elected First Peoples Assembly - the Gellung Warl - along with a “truth-telling” body, called Nyerna Yoorrook Telkuna, and an accountability body, known as Nginma Ngainga Wara.\n\nMr. Türk said the initiative marks important progress towards self-determination for the country’s First Peoples, addressing the “continued exclusion and discrimination” stemming from colonisation.\n\nHistoric step, ‘truly transformative’\n\nIn his statement, he added that Victoria’s approach could be “truly transformative” if fully implemented, ensuring Indigenous communities have a direct voice in shaping laws and policies that affect their lives.\n\nThe move follows the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart, which called for constitutional recognition and a voice for Indigenous Australians. Mr. Türk expressed hope that Victoria’s example would inspire similar action elsewhere in Australia and beyond, promoting reconciliation and respect for human rights for all.\n\nAround a quarter of Australia’s population lives in the state Victoria.\n\nHaiti: Independent UN experts warn women’s exclusion deepening crisis\n\nIndependent UN human rights experts have warned that Haiti’s deepening crisis cannot be resolved while women remain excluded from decision-making and exposed to widespread sexual violence.\n\n“Haiti is in the grip of one of the world’s most severe crises, and women and girls are bearing the brunt,” said the UN Working Group on discrimination against women and girls. “Yet they remain sidelined from processes that determine their safety, rights, and future.”\n\n© UNFPA In Haiti, people carrying their belongings flee their homes as night falls due to violence.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council-appointed experts said women are entirely absent from Haiti’s transitional leadership, where all seven voting members of the Presidential Council are men, and the new cabinet fails to meet the constitutional quota of 30 per cent female representation.\n\n“Haitian women have long played critical roles in rebuilding communities and supporting social cohesion,” the Group said. “Their exclusion is not only unjust – it is a strategic failure.”\n\n‘Weapon of terror’\n\nCriminal gangs continue to use sexual violence as a “weapon of terror”, particularly in the capital, Port-au-Prince, while survivors are left without protection or justice.\n\nThe experts urged Haitian authorities and international partners to act immediately to ensure women’s equal participation in political, security and recovery processes, warning that “Haiti’s crisis cannot be addressed without confronting the gendered dynamics of violence and governance.”",
