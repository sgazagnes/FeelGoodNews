NASA\n\nIn 2025, NASA and its international partners celebrate 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the International Space Station. Since November 2, 2000, more than 290 people from 26 countries have lived and worked aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting thousands of experiments that have advanced science and technology on Earth and paved the way for Artemis missions to the Moon and future journeys to Mars.\n\nBeyond its role as a science platform, the station has been a bridge—connecting cultures, sparking creativity, and inspiring generations. The memories of Johnson Space Center employees reflect how the orbiting laboratory is not only an engineering marvel but also a deeply human endeavor.\n\nChristopher Brown – Advancing Life Support Systems for Future Exploration\n\nChristopher Brown (center) receives the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement alongside NASA astronaut Sunita Williams. NASA/James Blair\n\nAs a space station Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) integrator, Christopher Brown’s role has been ensuring astronauts have clean air and water. ECLSS removes carbon dioxide from the air, supplies oxygen for breathing, and recycles wastewater—turning yesterday’s coffee into tomorrow’s coffee. Today, these systems can recover nearly 98% of the water brought to the station.\n\nHis proudest memory was commissioning regenerative life support systems and raising a symbolic toast with the crew while on console in mission control. He also helped activate the Water Storage System, saving crew time and improving operations on station. For Brown, these milestones were vital steps toward future long-duration missions beyond Earth.\n\nStephanie Sipila – The Heart of Microgravity Research\n\nNASA astronaut Kate Rubins works on the Cardinal Heart study, which seeks to help scientists understand the aging and weakening of heart muscles in the search for new treatments for astronauts and people on Earth. NASA/Mike Hopkins\n\nStephanie Sipila, now integration manager for NASA’s Extravehicular Activity and Human Surface Mobility Program, began her career as a mechanical and robotic systems instructor for the orbital outpost. Her favorite experiment, Engineered Heart Tissues, studies microgravity’s effect on the human heart to help develop new treatments for cardiovascular disease. She recalls NASA astronaut Sunita Williams running the Boston Marathon on a treadmill aboard station, becoming the first person to complete the race in space and showing how astronauts stay connected to Earth while living on orbit.\n\nSipila also highlights the Spacesuit Art Project, an initiative that turned artwork from children with cancer into spacesuits flown to and worn aboard the orbital outpost during live downlinks, connecting science, art, and hope — and raising awareness of cancer research conducted aboard the orbital outpost.\n\nLiz Warren – Where Exploration Meets Humanity\n\nNASA astronaut Jack Fischer wearing the Unity spacesuit painted by patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. NASA/Randy Bresnik\n\nSpace station Associate Chief Scientist Liz Warren has seen firsthand how the Spacesuit Art Project uplifted children on Earth. During Expedition 52, she watched astronaut Jack Fischer wear a suit covered in artwork created by young cancer patients, including his own daughter, a survivor. “It was incredibly touching to note the power of art and inspiration. Human spaceflight requires fortitude, resilience, and teamwork—so does fighting childhood cancer,” Warren said.\n\nHer memories also extend to her time as an operations lead for NASA’s Human Research Program, which uses research to develop methods to protect the health and performance of astronauts in space to prepare for long-duration missions. While out for a weekend run, Warren received a call from the Payload Operations and Integration Center in Huntsville, Alabama. An astronaut on station, following a prescribed diet for a research study, wanted to swap out a food item. Warren coordinated with her support team and relayed the decision back to orbit—all while continuing her run. The moment, she recalls, underscored the constant, real-time connection between astronauts in space and teams on the ground.\n\nAdam Baker – Checkmate: Space Debris Cleanup\n\nFlight Director Chris Edelen, left, and capsule communicator Jay Marschke discuss their next chess move during a match with NASA astronaut Greg Chamitoff, Expedition 17 flight engineer aboard the space station. NASA/Robert Markowitz\n\nAs an aerospace engineer, Adam Baker helped track experiments and spacecraft operations from mission control. Baker remembers when mission control played a live chess match with astronaut Greg Chamitoff during Expedition 17, a moment that showed the unique ways the station connects crews in orbit with people on Earth. His favorite technical project, though, was the RemoveDebris small satellite, deployed from the station in 2018 to test technologies for cleaning up space junk. “Knowing these experiments could one day help keep the orbital environment safe made it even more meaningful,” he said.\n\nMichael McFarlane – Training for Success\n\nEngineers run simulations inside Johnson’s Systems Engineering Simulator during a shuttle-to-station docking simulation. Smiley Pool/Houston Chronicle\n\nAs chief of the Simulation and Graphics Branch, Michael McFarlane prepared astronauts for space station assembly missions using high-fidelity simulators. “My greatest memory is seeing the station grow as we successfully executed assembly missions that looked very much like what we analyzed and trained for in our ground-based simulations,” he said.\n\nA Legacy of Ingenuity and Community\n\nDate: 10-31-2023 Location: Bldg 30 MCC, ISS MER Subject: Mission Evaluation Room (MER) Halloween Celebration “MERloween” Photographer: James Blair NASA/James Blair\n\nIn the Mission Evaluation Room, engineers not only troubleshoot in real time but also celebrate milestones with traditions like “MERloween,” where controllers dress in space-themed costumes to honor the year’s lessons learned.\n\nNASA’s SpaceX Dragon Freedom spacecraft splashed down in the Gulf of America, off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida, returning Crew-9 to Earth on March 18, 2025. NASA/Keegan Barber\n\nFor social media consultant Mark Garcia, sharing the station story with the public has been the highlight of his career. His favorite moment was watching NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 splash down in 2025, greeted by dolphins in the Gulf of America. “I love writing about the science aboard the station that benefits people on Earth,” he said.\n\nFor 25 years, the International Space Station has shown what humanity can accomplish together. The lessons learned aboard will guide Artemis missions to the Moon and future journeys to Mars—ensuring the next 25 years are built on innovation, resilience, and the human spirit.",

      "content": "A newly discovered cluster of objects called the “inner kernel” of the Kuiper belt could teach us about the early history of the solar system – including the movement of Neptune\n\nAn artist’s impression of the Kuiper belt ESO/M. Kornmesser\n\nThe Kuiper belt, a disc of icy rocks on the outermost edges of the solar system, seems to have more structure than we thought. In 2011, researchers found a cluster of objects there on similar orbits that they dubbed the “kernel” of the Kuiper belt – now, another team has spotted an even more compact cluster of objects that they are calling the “inner kernel”.\n\nThe original kernel was found by eye using plots of the orbits of 189 Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). It is about 44 astronomical units from the sun, where one astronomical unit is the distance between the sun and Earth. Since the discovery of the kernel, no additional structures have been found in the Kuiper belt.\n\nThat is, until Amir Siraj at Princeton University in New Jersey and his colleagues took on the painstaking task of refining the orbital data from 1650 KBOs and feeding it into an algorithm that searches for clustering and structure. They trained the algorithm to search for the kernel, and then examined the results to see if there were any more structures out there. “The kernel was never found alone – whenever the algorithm found the kernel, it found another group as well,” says Siraj.\n\nThe researchers called this newfound cluster the inner kernel because of its location about 43 astronomical units from the sun. All of the objects in the inner kernel have remarkably circular orbits, almost completely in line with the disc of the solar system.\n\n“That kind of orbital calmness is a signal of a very old, undisturbed structure – the kind of structure that can provide clues to the evolution of the solar system, how the giant planets have moved in their orbits, what kind of interstellar environments the solar system has been through, all sorts of things about the early days of the solar system,” says Siraj.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nIt could be particularly enlightening when it comes to learning about Neptune’s migration from the inner solar system, where it is thought to have formed, out to its current position, says David Nesvorný at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, one of the discoverers of the original kernel. Nesvorný says it is possible that as Neptune was moving outward, the KBOs that make up the kernel and inner kernel were briefly captured in place through gravitational interactions with the giant planet, causing the clumping that we see now, before being released as Neptune continued on its way.\n\nThe Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which began operations this year, is expected to find many more KBOs than we know of now, which should tell us more about the kernel and inner kernel, as well as whether there are any other as-yet-undiscovered structures on the solar system’s edge. “The more we learn about the architecture of the Kuiper belt, the more we learn about the solar system’s history,” says Siraj.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The Kuiper belt is a ring of icy rocks far beyond Neptune, at the edge of our solar system. In 2011, scientists found a group of objects there called the \"kernel,\" which helped us understand how the solar system formed and changed over time.\n\n**What happened** – A team led by Amir Siraj from Princeton University used new computer methods to study the orbits of 1,650 Kuiper belt objects. They found a smaller, tighter group of objects inside the original kernel. This new cluster is called the \"inner kernel\" and is located about 43 times the distance from the Earth to the sun.\n\n**Impact** – The objects in the inner kernel move in very smooth, circular paths, showing they have been undisturbed for a very long time. This calm arrangement can reveal how the giant planet Neptune moved from closer to the sun out to its current spot. As Neptune traveled, it may have trapped these objects temporarily, creating the clusters we see today.\n\n**What's next step** – The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which started working this year, will discover many more Kuiper belt objects.
