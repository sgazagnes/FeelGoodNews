      "title": "Betelgeuse has a hidden companion and Hubble just caught its wake",
      "summary": "Astronomers have uncovered the long-hidden cause behind Betelgeuse’s strange behavior: a small companion star carving a visible wake through the giant’s vast atmosphere. Using nearly eight years of observations from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observatories, scientists detected swirling trails of dense gas created as the companion, called Siwarha, moves through Betelgeuse’s outer layers.",
      "content": "Astronomers analyzing fresh observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and several ground-based observatories have uncovered clear signs that a recently identified companion star is shaping the environment around Betelgeuse. The study, led by researchers at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA), shows that the companion star, called Siwarha, is generating a dense stream of gas as it moves through Betelgeuse's enormous outer atmosphere. This newly observed structure helps explain the unusual and long-running changes seen in the giant star's brightness and atmospheric behavior.\n\nThe findings were announced at a news conference during the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix and have been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nEight Years of Observations Reveal a Stellar Wake\n\nResearchers identified the influence of Siwarha by carefully measuring subtle changes in Betelgeuse's light over nearly eight years. These long-term observations revealed the effects of a companion star that had previously been suspected but not confirmed. As the companion moves through Betelgeuse's outer layers, it disrupts the surrounding gas, producing a trail of denser material.\n\nThis detection resolves one of the most enduring puzzles surrounding Betelgeuse. By confirming the companion's presence, astronomers can now better explain how the star behaves and changes over time. The discovery also provides valuable insight into the later stages of evolution for other massive stars approaching the ends of their lives.\n\nBetelgeuse is located about 650 light-years from Earth in the constellation Orion. It is a red supergiant of extraordinary size, large enough to contain more than 400 million Suns. Because it is both enormous and relatively close to Earth, Betelgeuse is one of the few stars whose surface and surrounding atmosphere can be directly studied, making it a key target for understanding how giant stars grow older, lose material, and eventually explode as supernovae.\n\nMultiple Telescopes Confirm the Companion's Impact\n\nBy combining data from Hubble with observations from the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory and the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory, the team identified repeating patterns in Betelgeuse's behavior. These patterns provided strong evidence of the long-suspected companion star and revealed how it affects the red supergiant's outer atmosphere.\n\nScientists observed changes in the star's spectrum, meaning the specific colors of light produced by different elements, along with shifts in the motion of gas in the outer atmosphere. These changes are linked to a dense wake formed by the companion star. The wake appears shortly after the companion passes in front of Betelgeuse approximately every six years, or about 2,100 days, in agreement with earlier theoretical predictions.\n\n\"It's a bit like a boat moving through water. The companion star creates a ripple effect in Betelgeuse's atmosphere that we can actually see in the data,\" said Andrea Dupree, an astronomer at the CfA and lead author of the study. \"For the first time, we're seeing direct signs of this wake, or trail of gas, confirming that Betelgeuse really does have a hidden companion shaping its appearance and behavior.\"\n\nDecades of Strange Variability Explained\n\nAstronomers have monitored Betelgeuse for decades, tracking changes in its brightness and surface features in an effort to understand its unpredictable behavior. Interest surged in 2020 when the star unexpectedly dimmed after what was described as a stellar \"sneeze.\" Scientists identified two major cycles in Betelgeuse's variability: a shorter 400-day period linked to pulsations inside the star, and a much longer cycle lasting about 2,100 days.\n\nBefore this discovery, scientists explored many explanations for Betelgeuse's long-term changes. These included massive convection cells, clouds of dust, magnetic activity, and the potential influence of a hidden companion. Recent studies suggested that the longer cycle was best explained by a low-mass star orbiting deep within Betelgeuse's atmosphere. Although one group reported a possible detection, there was no definitive evidence until now.\n\nThe newly detected wake provides the strongest proof yet that a companion star is actively disturbing the atmosphere of this red supergiant.\n\n\"The idea that Betelgeuse had an undetected companion has been gaining in popularity for the past several years, but without direct evidence, it was an unproven theory,\" said Dupree. \"With this new direct evidence, Betelgeuse gives us a front-row seat to watch how a giant star changes over time. Finding the wake from its companion means we can now understand how stars like this evolve, shed material, and eventually explode as supernovae.\"\n\nLooking Ahead to Future Observations\n\nFrom Earth's perspective, Betelgeuse is currently eclipsing its companion star. Astronomers are planning additional observations when the companion becomes visible again in 2027. Researchers say this discovery could also help solve similar mysteries involving other giant and supergiant stars.\n\nHubble's Continuing Contributions\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope has been operating for more than 30 years and continues to produce discoveries that deepen our understanding of the universe. Hubble is a collaborative project between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, oversees mission operations, with additional support from Lockheed Martin Space in Denver. The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, manages Hubble's scientific operations for NASA.",

Scientists believe it is a “failed galaxy,” a leftover building block from the early Universe that never lit up. Its discovery confirms long-standing theories about starless galaxies. Cloud-9 offers a rare glimpse into the dark side of cosmic evolution.",
      "content": "Astronomers working with the Hubble Space Telescope have identified an entirely new type of cosmic object. It is a cloud rich in gas and dominated by dark matter, yet it contains no stars. Scientists consider it a relic left behind from the earliest stages of galaxy formation. The object, known as \"Cloud-9,\" is the first confirmed example of its kind ever observed in the Universe.\n\n\"This is a tale of a failed galaxy,\" said the program's principal investigator, Alejandro Benitez-Llambay of the Milano-Bicocca University in Milan, Italy. \"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes. In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local Universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"\n\nA Rare Glimpse of the Dark Universe\n\n\"This cloud is a window into the dark Universe,\" explained team member Andrew Fox of AURA/STScI for the European Space Agency. \"We know from theory that most of the mass in the Universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light. Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"\n\nCloud-9 belongs to a category known as Reionization-Limited H I Clouds, or \"RELHICs.\" The term \"H I\" refers to neutral hydrogen, while \"RELHIC\" describes a hydrogen cloud formed in the early Universe that never progressed to form stars. Scientists had predicted the existence of such objects for years, but direct confirmation remained elusive. Only after observing Cloud-9 with Hubble were researchers able to verify that it truly contains no stars.\n\nRuling Out a Hidden Dwarf Galaxy\n\n\"Before we used Hubble, you could argue that this is a faint dwarf galaxy that we could not see with ground-based telescopes. They just didn't go deep enough in sensitivity to uncover stars,\" explained lead author Gagandeep Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), Baltimore, USA. \"But with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, we're able to nail down that there's nothing there.\"\n\nThe discovery itself caught researchers off guard. \"Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,\" said STScI's Rachael Beaton, who is also on the research team.\n\nRELHICs are believed to be dark matter structures that never gathered enough gas to trigger star formation. Because of this, they preserve conditions from the early Universe. Cloud-9 points to the likely existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated objects, often described as failed galaxies. Studying them offers new insight into parts of the Universe that remain difficult to observe because most telescopes focus on bright stars and galaxies.\n\nMeasuring an Invisible Giant\n\nHydrogen clouds near the Milky Way have been studied for decades, but most are far larger and more irregular in shape than Cloud-9. By contrast, Cloud-9 is smaller, denser, and nearly spherical, giving it a distinctly different appearance from other known gas clouds.\n\nAt its center, Cloud-9 contains neutral hydrogen spanning roughly 4900 light-years. The hydrogen gas alone has a mass about 1 million times that of the Sun. If the gas pressure is indeed balanced by the gravitational pull of the surrounding dark matter, then dark matter must account for most of the object's mass. Based on this balance, Cloud-9 is estimated to contain roughly 5 billion solar masses.\n\nWhy Starless Objects Matter\n\nCloud-9 highlights how much of the Universe exists beyond stars. Observing starlight alone does not reveal the full picture. By examining gas and dark matter together, scientists can better understand systems that would otherwise remain hidden.\n\nFinding failed galaxies like Cloud-9 is difficult because nearby bright objects often overpower their faint signals. These systems are also sensitive to environmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping, which can remove gas as they move through intergalactic space. These challenges help explain why such objects appear to be rare.\n\nDiscovery Through Radio Telescopes\n\nCloud-9 was first detected three years ago during a radio survey conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in Guizhou, China. The discovery was later confirmed using the Green Bank Telescope and the Very Large Array in the United States. The name \"Cloud-9\" carries no cultural meaning in China and was assigned simply because it was the ninth gas cloud identified near the outer regions of the spiral galaxy Messier 94 (M94).\n\nThe cloud lies close to M94 and appears to be physically connected to the galaxy. High-resolution radio observations reveal slight distortions in the gas, which may be evidence of interaction between Cloud-9 and its larger neighbor.\n\nA Galaxy That Might Still Form\n\nWhether Cloud-9 will eventually become a galaxy depends on whether it gains additional mass. If it had been much larger, gravity would have caused it to collapse and form stars long ago. If it were much smaller, its gas might have dispersed and become ionized, leaving little behind. Instead, it exists in a narrow range that allows it to persist as a RELHIC.\n\nThis discovery advances understanding of how galaxies form, how the early Universe evolved, and how dark matter behaves. Because Cloud-9 contains no stars, it allows scientists to study the properties of dark matter clouds without interference from starlight. As future surveys improve, researchers expect to uncover more of these rare relics, offering deeper insight into the Universe's hidden structure and the physics of dark matter.",

      "content": "NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket is seen inside High Bay 3 of the Vehicle Assembly Building as teams await the arrival of Artemis II crewmembers to board their Orion spacecraft on top of the rocket as part of the Artemis II countdown demonstration test, Saturday, Dec. 20, 2025, at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA/Joel Kowsky\n\nAs NASA moves closer to launch of the Artemis II test flight, the agency soon will roll its SLS (Space Launch System) rocket and Orion spacecraft to the launch pad for the first time at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida to begin final integration, testing, and launch rehearsals.\n\nNASA is targeting no earlier than Saturday, Jan. 17, to begin the multi-hour trek from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Pad 39B. The four-mile journey on the crawler-transporter-2 will take up to 12 hours. Teams are working around the clock to close out all tasks ahead of rollout. However, this target date is subject to change if additional time is needed for technical preparations or weather.\n\n“We are moving closer to Artemis II, with rollout just around the corner,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. “We have important steps remaining on our path to launch and crew safety will remain our top priority at every turn, as we near humanity’s return to the Moon.”\n\nAs with all new developments of complex systems, engineers have been troubleshooting several items in recent days and weeks. During final checkouts before rollout, technicians found a cable involved in the flight termination system was bent out of specifications. Teams are replacing it and will test the new cable over the weekend. Additionally, a valve associated with Orion’s hatch pressurization exhibited issues leading up to a Dec. 20 countdown demonstration test. On Jan. 5, the team successfully replaced and tested it. Engineers also worked to resolve leaky ground support hardware required to load gaseous oxygen into Orion for breathing air.\n\nRollout\n\nOnce the integrated rocket and spacecraft reach the launch pad, NASA will immediately begin a long checklist of launch pad preparations, including connecting ground support equipment such as electrical lines, fuel environmental control system ducts, and cryogenic propellant feeds. Teams will power up all integrated systems at the pad for the first time to ensure flight hardware components are functioning properly with each other, the mobile launcher, and ground infrastructure systems.\n\nOnce complete, the Artemis II astronauts, NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, and CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen, will conduct a final walkdown at the pad.\n\nWet dress rehearsal, tanking\n\nAt the end of January, NASA will conduct a wet dress rehearsal, which is a prelaunch test to fuel the rocket. During wet dress, teams demonstrate the ability to load more than 700,000 gallons of cryogenic propellants into the rocket, conduct a launch countdown, and practice safely removing propellant from the rocket without astronauts onsite.\n\nDuring launch, a closeout crew will be responsible for securing astronauts in Orion and closing its hatches. The closeout crew also will use this rehearsal to practice their procedures safely without astronauts aboard the spacecraft.\n\nThe wet dress rehearsal will include several “runs” to demonstrate the launch team’s ability to hold, resume, and recycle to several different times in the final 10 minutes of the countdown, known as terminal count.\n\nThe first run will begin approximately 49 hours before launch when launch teams are called to their stations, to 1 minute 30 seconds before launch, followed by a planned three-minute hold and then countdown resumption to 33 seconds before launch – the point at which the rocket’s automatic launch sequencer will control the final seconds of the countdown. Teams then will recycle back to T-10 minutes and hold, then resume down to 30 seconds before launch as part of a second run.\n\nWhile NASA has integrated lessons learned from Artemis I into the launch countdown procedures, the agency will pause to address any issues during the test or at any other point should technical challenges arise. Engineers will have a close eye on propellant loading of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the rocket, after challenges encountered with liquid hydrogen loading during Artemis I wet dress rehearsals. Teams also will pay close attention to the effectiveness of recently updated procedures to limit how much gaseous nitrogen accumulates in the space between Orion’s crew module and launch abort system hatches, which could pose an issue for the closeout crew.\n\nAdditional wet dress rehearsals may be required to ensure the vehicle is completely checked out and ready for flight.\n\nIf needed, NASA may rollback SLS and Orion to the Vehicle Assembly Building for additional work ahead of launch after the wet dress rehearsal.\n\nNext steps toward launch\n\nFollowing a successful wet dress rehearsal, NASA will convene a flight readiness review where the mission management team will assess the readiness of all systems, including flight hardware, infrastructure, and launch, flight, and recovery teams before committing to a launch date.\n\nWhile the Artemis II launch window opens as early as Friday, Feb. 6, the mission management team will assess flight readiness after the wet dress rehearsal across the spacecraft, launch infrastructure, and the crew and operations teams before selecting a launch date.\n\nTo determine potential launch dates, engineers identified key constraints required to accomplish the mission and keep the crew inside Orion safe. The resulting launch periods are the days or weeks where the spacecraft and rocket can meet mission objectives. These launch periods account for the complex orbital mechanics involved in launching on a precise trajectory toward the Moon while the Earth is rotating on its axis and the Moon is orbiting Earth each month in its lunar cycle. This results in a pattern of approximately one week of launch opportunities, followed by three weeks without launch opportunities.\n\nThere are several primary parameters that dictate launch availability within these periods. Because of its unique trajectory relative to subsequent lunar landing missions, these key constraints are unique to the Artemis II test flight.\n\nThe launch day and time must allow SLS to be able to deliver Orion into a high Earth orbit where the crew and ground teams will evaluate the spacecraft’s life support systems before the crew ventures to the Moon.\n\nOrion also must be in the proper alignment with the Earth and Moon at the time of the trans-lunar injection burn. The Artemis II trans-lunar injection burn places Orion on course to flyby the Moon, and also sets it on a free return trajectory, in which the spacecraft uses the Moon’s gravity to send the spacecraft back to Earth without additional major propulsive maneuvers.\n\nThe trajectory for a given day must ensure Orion is not in darkness for more than 90 minutes at a time so that the solar array wings can receive and convert sunlight to electricity, and the spacecraft can maintain an optimal temperature range. Mission planners eliminate potential launch dates that would send Orion into extended eclipses during the flight.\n\nThe launch date must support a trajectory that allows for the proper entry profile planned during Orion’s return to Earth.\n\nThe periods below show launch availability through April 2026. Mission planners refine the periods based on updated analysis approximately two months before they begin and are subject to change.\n\nLaunch Period Jan. 31 – Feb. 14\n\nLaunch opportunities February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11\n\nLaunch Period Feb. 28 – March 13\n\nLaunch opportunities March 6, 7, 8, 9, 11\n\nLaunch Period March 27 – April 10\n\nLaunch opportunities April 1, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\nIn addition to the launch opportunities based on orbital mechanics and performance requirements, there are also limitations on which days within a launch period can be viable based on commodity replenishment, weather, and other users on the Eastern Range schedule. As a general rule, up to four launch attempts may be attempted within the approximate week of opportunities that exist within a launch period.\n\nAs the agency prepares for its first crewed mission beyond Earth orbit in more than 50 years, NASA expects to learn along the way, both on the ground and in flight, and will let the readiness and performance of its systems dictate when the agency is ready to launch.\n\nAs part of a Golden Age of innovation and exploration, the approximately 10-day Artemis II test flight is the first crewed flight under NASA’s Artemis campaign. It is another step toward new U.S.-crewed missions to the Moon’s surface, leading to a sustained presence on the Moon that will help the agency prepare to send the first astronauts – Americans – to Mars.\n\nLearn more about NASA’s Artemis campaign:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/artemis",

      "summary": "Scientists have discovered an enormous stream of super-hot gas erupting from a nearby galaxy, driven by a powerful black hole at its center. The jets stretch farther than the galaxy itself and spiral outward in a rare, never-before-seen pattern. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope pierced through thick dust to reveal this violent outflow. The process is so intense it’s robbing the galaxy of star-forming gas at a staggering rate.",
      "content": "Astronomers at the University of California, Irvine have identified what appears to be the largest stream of super-heated gas ever observed in the universe, flowing out of a nearby galaxy known as VV 340a. The findings were reported in the journal Science.\n\nUsing data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the researchers detected vast clouds of extremely hot gas erupting from both sides of the galaxy. These glowing structures form two long, narrow nebulae driven by intense activity around a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's core. Each nebula stretches at least three kiloparsecs in length (one parsec equates to roughly 19 trillion miles).\n\nFor comparison, the entire disk of the VV 340a galaxy measures only about three kiloparsecs in thickness.\n\n\"In other galaxies, this type of highly energized gas is almost always confined to several tens of parsecs from a galaxy's black hole, and our discovery exceeds what is typically seen by a factor of 30 or more,\" said lead author Justin Kader, a UC Irvine postdoctoral researcher in physics and astronomy.\n\nPowerful Black Hole Jets Revealed\n\nRadio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array near San Agustin, New Mexico revealed a pair of massive plasma jets emerging from opposite sides of the galaxy. These jets are known to form when gas falling into a supermassive black hole reaches extreme temperatures and interacts with powerful magnetic fields. As a result, energized material is launched outward at tremendous speeds.\n\nOn even larger scales, the jets trace a spiral-like path through space. This pattern points to a process known as \"jet precession,\" which refers to a gradual shift in the direction of the jets over time, similar to the slow wobble of a spinning top.\n\n\"This is the first observation of a precessing kiloparsec-scale radio jet in a disk galaxy,\" said Kader. \"To our knowledge, this is the first time we have seen a kiloparsec, or galactic-scale, precessing radio jet driving a massive coronal gas outflow.\"\n\nRare Coronal Gas Extends Far Beyond the Galaxy\n\nAs the jets push outward, the team believes they collide with surrounding material inside the galaxy, forcing it away from the center and heating it to extreme temperatures. This process creates what scientists call coronal line gas, a name borrowed from the sun's outer atmosphere to describe highly ionized, super-hot plasma.\n\nAccording to Kader, this type of coronal gas is usually found very close to a black hole and rarely spreads far into the host galaxy. It is almost never detected outside the galaxy itself, making the new observations highly unusual.\n\nThe sheer power of the outflow is staggering. Kader said the energy carried by the coronal gas is equivalent to 10 quintillion hydrogen bombs exploding every second.\n\n\"We found the most extended and coherent coronal gas structure to date,\" said senior co-author Vivian U, a former UC Irvine research astronomer who is now an associate scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center. \"We expected JWST to open up the wavelength window where these tools for probing active supermassive black holes would be available to us, but we had not expected to see such highly collimated and extended emission in the first object we looked at. It was a nice surprise.\"\n\nMultiple Telescopes Reveal a Violent History\n\nThe full picture of the jets and the glowing coronal gas emerged only after the researchers combined data from several observatories. Observations from the University of California-operated Keck II Telescope in Hawaii uncovered cooler gas extending much farther from the galaxy, reaching distances of up to 15 kiloparsecs from the black hole.\n\nThe scientists think this cooler material represents a \"fossil record\" of earlier jet activity. It likely consists of leftover debris from previous episodes when the black hole expelled gas from the galaxy's core.\n\nWhy the James Webb Space Telescope Was Essential\n\nThe coronal gas itself was detected by the Webb telescope, which orbits the sun about one million miles from Earth. As the largest space telescope ever built, Webb observes the universe in infrared light, allowing it to see objects hidden from traditional visible-light telescopes.\n\nThis capability was critical for studying VV 340a. The galaxy contains large amounts of dust that block visible light, preventing telescopes like Keck from seeing deep into its interior. Infrared light, however, passes through the dust, making the erupting coronal gas clearly visible in Webb's images.\n\nJets That Shut Down Star Formation\n\nThe impact of the black hole jets on the galaxy is dramatic. According to the study, VV 340a is losing enough gas each year to form 19 stars like our sun.\n\n\"What it really is doing is significantly limiting the process of star formation in the galaxy by heating and removing star-forming gas,\" said Kader.\n\nClues to the Milky Way's Past and Future\n\nNo similar jet appears to be active in the Milky Way today. However, Kader noted that evidence suggests our own supermassive black hole experienced a feeding event about two million years ago, something he said early human ancestors such as Homo erectus may have witnessed in the night sky.\n\nWith the discovery of this rare precessing jet and its massive gas outflow, the researchers now plan to examine other galaxies for similar features. Their goal is to better understand how powerful black hole activity can influence the long-term evolution of galaxies like the Milky Way.\n\n\"We are excited to continue exploring such never-before-seen phenomena at different physical scales of galaxies using observations from these state-of-the-art tools, and we can't wait to see what else we will find,\" U said.\n\nFunding for the research was provided by NASA and the National Science Foundation.",
