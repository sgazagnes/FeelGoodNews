      "summary": "Scientists discovered that more muscle and less hidden abdominal fat are linked to a younger biological brain age. Deep visceral fat appeared to accelerate brain aging, while muscle mass offered a protective effect.",
      "content": "Researchers report that people who have more muscle and a lower visceral fat to muscle ratio tend to show signs of a younger biological brain age. This conclusion comes from a study that will be presented next week at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Visceral fat refers to the fat stored deep in the abdomen around key internal organs.\n\n\"Healthier bodies with more muscle mass and less hidden belly fat are more likely to have healthier, youthful brains,\" said senior study author Cyrus Raji, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of radiology and neurology in the Department of Radiology at Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. \"Better brain health, in turn, lowers the risk for future brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's.\"\n\nHow MRI Measures Brain Age and Body Composition\n\nBrain age is an estimate of how old the brain appears biologically, based on its structure as seen through MRI. Body MRI can track muscle mass, which serves as a marker for efforts to reduce frailty and strengthen overall health. Estimated brain age from structural scans may also shed light on risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, including muscle loss.\n\n\"While it is commonly known that chronological aging translates to loss of muscle mass and increased hidden belly fat, this work shows that these health measures relate to brain aging itself,\" Dr. Raji said. \"It shows muscle and fat mass quantified in the body are key reflectors of brain health, as tracked with brain aging.\"\n\nStudy Details: Imaging, AI Analysis, and Participant Profile\n\nThe study evaluated 1,164 healthy adults (52% women) across four research sites using whole-body MRI. Participants had a mean chronological age of 55.17 years. Imaging included T1-weighted MRI sequences, which highlight fat as bright and fluid as dark, providing a clear view of muscle, fat, and brain tissue. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm measured total normalized muscle volume, visceral fat (hidden belly fat), subcutaneous fat (fat under the skin) and predicted brain age.\n\nThe data indicated that individuals with a higher visceral fat to muscle ratio had higher predicted brain age. Subcutaneous fat showed no meaningful association with how old the brain appeared.\n\n\"The participants with more muscle tended to have younger-looking brains, while those with more hidden belly fat relative to their muscle had older-looking brains,\" Dr. Raji said. \"The fat just under the skin wasn't related to brain aging. In short, more muscle and a lower visceral fat to muscle ratio were linked to a younger brain.\"\n\nImplications for Health, Prevention, and Future Interventions\n\nDr. Raji explained that focusing on building muscle and reducing visceral fat are realistic and actionable goals. Whole-body MRI and AI-based brain age estimates can offer clear benchmarks for programs designed to lower visceral fat while maintaining or increasing muscle.\n\nHe also noted that the results highlight the close connection between physical health and brain health.\n\n\"This research has validated widely held hypotheses about the association between body composition biomarkers and brain health and provides a foundation for those biomarkers to be included in future trials of various metabolic interventions and treatments,\" he said.\n\nWhat the Findings Mean for GLP-1 Weight Loss Drugs\n\nCommonly prescribed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) weight loss medications, including Ozempic, are effective at reducing body fat but may also contribute to muscle loss. Dr. Raji suggested that the study's findings could help guide the development of next-generation therapies. These future treatments may aim to reduce visceral fat more than subcutaneous fat while protecting muscle mass.\n\n\"Losing fat -- especially visceral fat -- while preserving muscle volume would have the best benefit on brain aging and brain health based on insights from our work,\" he said. \"Thus, our study can inform future treatments by promoting research that quantifies MRI of body fat, muscle and brain age, which can help determine the optimal dosing regimens for GLP-1s to achieve the best outcomes in body and brain health.\"\n\nCo-authors are Somayeh Meysami, M.D., Soojin Lee, Ph.D., Saurabh Garg, M.Sc., Nasrin Akbari, M.Sc., Rodrigo Solis Pompa M.D., M.H.Sc., Ahmed Gouda, M.Sc., Thanh Duc Nguyen, Ph.D., Saqib Abdullah Basar, M.B.B.S., M.P.H., Yosef G.

      "title": "Cocoa and tea may protect your heart from the hidden damage of sitting",
      "summary": "Scientists found that high-flavanol foods can prevent the decline in blood vessel function that occurs after prolonged sitting. Even physically fit men weren’t protected unless they had consumed flavanols beforehand. A cocoa drink rich in these compounds kept arteries functioning normally. Everyday foods like berries, apples, tea, and certain cocoa products could offer a simple way to protect long-term vascular health.",
      "content": "New findings from the University of Birmingham suggest that regularly eating foods rich in flavanols, including tea, berries, apples, and cocoa, may help protect men's blood vessels from the negative effects that occur during long periods of sitting.\n\nSedentary habits are widespread in modern life. Young adults spend an estimated six hours a day seated, and extended sitting is known to reduce how well blood vessels function.\n\nEarlier research has shown that even a small 1% drop in vascular function, measured through brachial Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), corresponds to a 13% rise in the risk of cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease, strokes, and heart attacks.\n\nResearchers in the new study set out to determine whether specific dietary choices, particularly foods high in flavanols, could help offset the decline in vascular health that occurs during uninterrupted sitting.\n\nWhat Flavanols Are and Why They Matter\n\nFlavanols are naturally occurring polyphenols found in various fruits, tea, nuts, and cocoa beans. They have previously been linked to cardiovascular benefits, including support for the vascular system during psychological stress.\n\nThe study, which has been published in the Journal of Physiology, builds on this earlier evidence.\n\nDr. Catarina Rendeiro, Assistant Professor in Nutritional Sciences at the University of Birmingham and lead author, explained: \"Whether we are sitting at desks, behind the wheel of a car, on a train, or on the sofa reading a book or watching TV, we all spend a lot of time seated. Even though we are not moving our bodies, we are still putting them under stress. Finding ways to mitigate the impact that sitting for uninterrupted periods has on our vascular system could help us cut the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.\"\n\nCardiovascular disease continues to rise. According to the British Heart Foundation, deaths among working-aged adults in the UK increased by 18% to 21,975 in 2023 compared to 2019. Recent analyses also estimate that cardiovascular diseases cost the UK approximately £29 billion.\n\nTesting Whether Flavanols Protect the Body During Sitting\n\nTo explore whether flavanols could help preserve vascular function, the researchers examined the effects of these compounds during a two-hour sitting period. Forty healthy young men took part. Twenty had higher fitness levels and twenty had lower fitness levels. Each participant consumed either a high-flavanol cocoa drink (695 mg of total flavanols per beverage) or a low-flavanol cocoa drink (5.6 mg of total flavanols per beverage) before beginning the sitting session.\n\nWomen were not included in the study because fluctuations in estrogen during the menstrual cycle may influence how flavanols affect vascular function. The researchers note that this should be explored in future trials.\n\nBefore and after the sitting period, the team measured several indicators of vascular health, including:\n\nFMD in the superficial femoral artery and the brachial artery\n\narterial resting shear rate and blood flow\n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure\n\nleg muscle oxygenation\n\nHigh-Flavanol Cocoa Prevents Declines in Blood Vessel Function\n\nBoth the higher and lower fitness groups who consumed the low-flavanol drink showed declines in FMD in the arteries of their arms and legs. These participants also experienced increases in diastolic blood pressure, reductions in shear rate and blood flow, and lower leg muscle oxygenation. The results indicate that simply being more physically fit does not protect against the vascular effects of prolonged sitting.\n\nIn contrast, participants in both fitness groups who consumed the high-flavanol cocoa did not show declines in FMD in either the arm or leg arteries. This is the first study to demonstrate that flavanols can prevent sitting-induced vascular dysfunction in healthy young men.\n\nDr. Sam Lucas, Professor of Cerebrovascular, Exercise & Environmental Physiology at the University of Birmingham and co-author, said: \"Our experiment indicates that higher fitness levels do not prevent the temporary impairment of vascular function induced by sitting when only drinking low-flavanol cocoa. Importantly, after the high-flavanol drink, both fitter and less-fit participants kept their FMD the same as it was before sitting for two hours.\"\n\nThe results also show for the first time that baseline cardiorespiratory fitness does not change how the body responds to flavanol intake. This suggests that flavanols may help support vascular health regardless of someone's fitness level.\n\nAdding Flavanol-Rich Foods to Daily Routines\n\nAlessio Daniele, PhD student at the University of Birmingham, noted: \"It is actually quite easy to add high flavanol foods to your diet. There are cocoa products available in supermarkets and health stores which are processed through methods that preserve flavanol levels. If cocoa isn't your thing, fruits like apples, plums and berries, nuts, and black and green tea are all common kitchen staples and are readily available.\"\n\nDr. Catarina Rendeiro added: \"Our research shows that consuming high-flavanol foods and drinks during periods spent sitting down is a good way to reduce some of the impact of inactivity on the vascular system.\n\n\"Given how common sedentary lifestyles have become and the increased risk this can have to vascular health, using flavanol-rich food and drink, especially in combination with breaking up periods of inactivity by going for a short walk or standing up, could be a good way to enhance long-term health, no matter the individual's fitness level.\"",

      "summary": "Ribosomes don’t just make proteins—they can sense when something’s wrong. When they collide, they send out stress signals that activate a molecule called ZAK. Researchers uncovered how ZAK recognizes these collisions and turns them into protective responses. The discovery shows how cells quickly spot trouble.",
      "content": "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) researchers have uncovered how ribosomes are able to alert the cell when something is wrong.\n\nRibosomes are best known as the cell's protein builders. They attach to mRNA and travel along it, interpreting the genetic code and linking amino acids to form new proteins. Their role, however, extends beyond basic protein production. Ribosomes also help detect cellular stress and can trigger protective actions when the cell encounters harmful conditions. An international team led by Professor Roland Beckmann from LMU's Gene Center Munich has now identified the key steps that launch this stress signaling process. The results were published in Nature.\n\nHow Stress Disrupts Protein Production\n\nProtein synthesis is extremely sensitive to disruptions such as limited amino acids, damaged mRNA, or viral infections. These forms of stress interfere with normal mRNA reading and can cause ribosomes to stall and run into one another. When collisions occur, they set off what is known as the ribotoxic stress response (RSR). This response activates pathways that either repair the damage or, if necessary, initiate programmed cell death.\n\nInvestigating ZAK With Biochemistry and Cryo-Electron Microscopy\n\nThe protein ZAK -- a so-called kinase, that is, an enzyme which activates other molecules by transferring a phosphate group to them -- plays a central role in controlling this stress response. Until now, it had been unclear how ZAK detects ribosomes that have collided and uses that information to activate signaling pathways. By combining biochemical experiments with cryo-electron microscopy, the research group demonstrated that ribosome collisions serve as the main activation cue for ZAK.\n\nThe scientists identified how ZAK attaches to ribosomes and which structural features of the collided ribosomes are necessary for its activation. They found that ZAK interacts with specific ribosomal proteins, causing particular regions of ZAK to dimerize, meaning that two copies of the protein pair up. This pairing initiates the cellular signaling cascade.\n\nWhy Understanding ZAK Matters\n\n\"A deeper understanding of these mechanisms is important for several reasons,\" says Beckmann. According to him, ZAK functions at one of the earliest stages of the stress response, so learning how it recognizes ribosome collisions offers valuable insight into how cells detect disturbances with remarkable speed. It also helps explain how ribosomal quality control, downstream signaling networks, and the immune system coordinate their responses.\n\nZAK is also of medical relevance, as abnormal ZAK activity is linked to inflammatory diseases and persistent ribosomal stress. \"Our findings thus illuminate a central principle of eukaryotic stress biology,\" says Beckmann. \"The translation machinery itself serves here as a surveillance platform from which global stress signals are initiated.\"",

Allergenic fragrances will be prohibited in toys for children under 3 and in toys designed to be placed in the mouth.\n\nSafety assessment\n\nBefore placing a toy on the market, manufacturers will have to carry out a safety assessment on all potential hazards − chemical, physical, mechanical, and electrical. The assessment will also have to test toys’ flammability, hygiene, and radioactivity, and take children’s specific vulnerabilities into account. For example, manufacturers should, where appropriate, ensure that digital toys do not pose risks to children’s mental health.\n\nDigital product passport\n\nThe new rules will reduce the number of unsafe toys through better enforcement and more efficient customs checks. All toys must have a clearly visible digital product passport (DPP), showing compliance with the relevant safety rules. The DPP will enhance the traceability of toys and make market surveillance and customs checks simpler and more efficient. It will also offer consumers easy access to safety information and warnings, via a QR code, for example.\n\nEconomic operators and online shops\n\nThe regulation clarifies and introduces stronger requirements for economic operators (such as manufacturers, importers, distributors and service providers). For example, manufacturers will be required to mark warnings in easily understandable language and if any toy-related risks arise, they will have to take corrective measures and inform market surveillance authorities and consumers immediately.\n\nReflecting their growing role in the sale and promotion of toys, online marketplaces will be obliged to set up their platforms in a way that allows sellers to display toys’ CE markings, safety warnings and digital product passports. Toys that do not comply with the safety rules will be considered “illegal content” under the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nQuote\n\nThe rapporteur Marion Walsmann (EPP, DE) said: \"With the new toy safety regulation, Europe is sending a clear signal: safety must not be left up to chance. Thanks to clear guidelines, modern safety requirements and fair transitional arrangements, companies can plan and grow responsibly – and children can play carefree. This regulation is a win for everyone: consumers, manufacturers and the future of our children.\"\n\nNext steps\n\nThe new rules will enter into force on the 20th day following their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nBackground\n\nEU toy safety rules lay down the essential safety requirements that toys must meet to be placed on the EU market, irrespective of whether they are made in the EU or elsewhere. Toys must carry a CE marking, indicating conformity with EU safety standards. Last year toys were the second most notified product in the EU rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products (15%), second only to cosmetics (36%), with chemical ingredients as the main cause of risk in almost half of the alerts.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union already has strict rules to keep toys safe for children, but some dangerous toys still reach them, especially through online shopping. The EU wanted to update these rules to better protect children’s health and development.\n\n**What happened** – On Tuesday, members of the European Parliament agreed with EU countries on new toy safety rules. These rules update a law from 2009 and add new protections against harmful chemicals, require detailed safety tests for toys, and introduce digital product passports to track toy safety. Companies have about four and a half years to follow the new rules.\n\n**Impact** – The new rules ban harmful chemicals that can affect children’s hormones, breathing, skin, and organs. Toys for very young children cannot have allergenic smells, and all toys must be tested for risks like fire, hygiene, and even mental health concerns from digital toys. The digital product passport helps customs and market inspectors quickly check if toys are safe. Online stores must clearly show safety information and remove unsafe toys faster.\n\n**What’s next step** – The rules will officially start about 20 days after being published in the EU’s official journal. After that, companies and shops will begin the transition to meet the new safety standards and use the digital passports.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU’s new toy safety rules set higher chemical bans, detailed safety checks, and digital tracking to better protect children from unsafe toys.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’Union européenne a déjà des règles strictes pour garantir la sécurité des jouets, mais certains jouets dangereux parviennent encore aux enfants, notamment via les achats en ligne. L’UE a voulu mettre à jour ces règles pour mieux protéger la santé et le développement des enfants.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Mardi, les députés européens ont confirmé un accord avec les pays de l’UE sur de nouvelles règles de sécurité des jouets. Ces règles mettent à jour une loi de 2009 en ajoutant des protections contre des substances chimiques nocives, en exigeant des tests de sécurité approfondis et en introduisant des passeports numériques pour suivre la sécurité des jouets. Les entreprises disposent d’environ quatre ans et demi pour appliquer ces règles.\n\n**Impact** – Les nouvelles règles interdisent des substances chimiques qui peuvent perturber les hormones des enfants, affecter leur respiration, leur peau et leurs organes. Les jouets pour les tout-petits ne doivent pas contenir de parfums allergènes, et tous les jouets doivent être testés pour des risques comme le feu, l’hygiène et même les effets sur la santé mentale des jouets numériques. Le passeport numérique facilite les contrôles douaniers et de marché pour vérifier rapidement la sécurité des jouets. Les boutiques en ligne doivent afficher clairement les informations de sécurité et retirer plus vite les jouets dangereux.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les règles entreront officiellement en vigueur environ 20 jours après leur publication dans le Journal officiel de l’UE. Ensuite, les entreprises et les magasins commenceront la transition pour respecter les nouvelles normes et utiliser les passeports numériques.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – Les nouvelles règles européennes renforcent les interdictions chimiques, les contrôles de sécurité et la traçabilité numérique pour mieux protéger les enfants des jouets dangereux.\n",

Las empresas tienen unos cuatro años y medio para cumplirlas.\n\n**Impacto** – Las nuevas reglas prohíben químicos que afectan las hormonas, la respiración, la piel y órganos de los niños. Los juguetes para niños menores de tres años no pueden tener fragancias alergénicas, y todos los juguetes deben probarse para riesgos como incendio, higiene e incluso salud mental en juguetes digitales. El pasaporte digital ayuda a aduanas e inspectores a verificar la seguridad rápidamente. Las tiendas en línea deben mostrar claramente la información de seguridad y retirar rápido los juguetes inseguros.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Las reglas entrarán en vigor unos 20 días después de su publicación en el Diario Oficial de la UE. Después, empresas y tiendas comenzarán la transición para cumplir con las nuevas normas y usar los pasaportes digitales.\n\n**Una frase clave** – Las nuevas reglas de la UE aumentan las prohibiciones químicas, pruebas de seguridad y rastreo digital para proteger mejor a los niños de juguetes inseguros.\n",
