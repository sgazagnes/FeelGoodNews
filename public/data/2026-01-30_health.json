      "content": "X-rays show a 33-year old patients’ new lungs (left) and old lungs (right).Credit: Northwestern Medicine\n\nA 33-year-old man survived for 48 hours without his lungs, after a medical team replaced the organs with an external artificial-lung system1 that it developed to keep him alive until he could receive a double lung transplant.\n\nThere have been cases in which people have had their lungs removed and been connected to an external device to maintain oxygen levels. But, the devices used in these cases don’t count as artificial lungs because they do not maintain blood flow across the heart, meaning it cannot function normally, says Ankit Bharat, a thoracic surgeon at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois, who helped to develop the artificial system.\n\nBharat says his team’s design is unique because it maintains a balanced and continuous flow of blood to the heart, reducing the risk of blood clots that could trigger a heart attack. The findings were published today in the journal Med.\n\nThe engineering behind the artificial-lung system is remarkable, says Natasha Rogers, a transplant clinician at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia. It is difficult to maintain normal heart function in the absence of lungs, she says. “They were really very brave.”\n\nThe team’s artificial-lung system could be used in other critically unwell people while they become healthy enough to receive lung transplants, she adds.\n\nLife-threatening condition\n\nBefore being placed on the artificial-lung system, the man had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome — an often-life-threatening condition in which the lungs cannot absorb enough oxygen — triggered by the influenza virus. He was then placed on a ventilator but developed a drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The infection caused parts of his lungs to fill with pus, and he went into septic shock, at which point his heart and kidneys began to fail.\n\n“He was so sick, he had a cardiac arrest and he was actively dying,” says Bharat. Because the man was too unwell to receive a lung transplant, the team decided to remove his lungs — the source of the infection.\n\nSurgeons removed a patient’s infected lungs. An artificial lung system kept him alive.Credit: Northwestern Medicine\n\nSurprisingly, the man began to improve quickly. “Within 48 hours, he was off all the medication to support his blood pressure, his kidney function was completely restored and his heart was working normally,” says Bharat. At that point, the man received a double lung transplant and has showed no signs of organ rejection or impaired lung function years later. “We are now approaching almost three years since we did this, and the patient is doing really great,” says Bharat.\n\nPandemic invention",

      "title": "A simple blood test could spot Parkinson’s years before symptoms",
      "summary": "Scientists in Sweden and Norway have uncovered a promising way to spot Parkinson’s disease years—possibly decades—before its most damaging symptoms appear. By detecting subtle biological signals in the blood tied to how cells handle stress and repair DNA, the team identified a brief early window when Parkinson’s quietly leaves a measurable fingerprint.",
      "content": "Researchers led by a team at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have identified biological markers that appear in the earliest stages of Parkinson's disease, before major damage occurs in the brain. These early changes leave detectable traces in the blood, but only for a short time. The findings highlight a critical opportunity to both diagnose the disease earlier and explore treatments while the brain is still largely intact. The researchers believe blood tests based on this work could begin to be tested in healthcare settings within five years.\n\nParkinson's disease affects more than 10 million people worldwide and is considered an endemic condition. As populations continue to age, that number is expected to more than double by 2050. Despite its growing impact, there is currently no cure and no widely used screening method that can detect the disease early, before it causes significant and often irreversible brain damage.\n\nNew Study Points Toward Earlier Diagnosis\n\nThe findings were published in the journal npj Parkinson's Disease by a research team from Chalmers University of Technology and Oslo University Hospital in Norway. The study describes major progress toward identifying Parkinson's during its earliest phase, well before classic movement-related symptoms appear.\n\n\"By the time the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease appear, 50 -- 80 per cent of the relevant brain cells are often already damaged or gone. The study is an important step towards facilitating early identification of the disease and counteracting its progression before it has gone this far,\" says Danish Anwer, a doctoral student at the Department of Life Sciences at Chalmers and the study's first author.\n\nA Long and Overlooked Early Phase\n\nParkinson's disease develops slowly. In many patients, the early phase can last up to 20 years before noticeable motor symptoms fully emerge. During this time, changes are already occurring inside cells.\n\nThe researchers focused on two biological processes believed to play a role at this early stage. One is DNA damage repair, the system cells use to detect and fix genetic damage. The other is the cellular stress response, a protective reaction that helps cells survive by shifting energy away from routine tasks and toward repair and defense.\n\nMachine Learning Reveals a Unique Pattern\n\nUsing machine learning and other advanced analytical methods, the team identified a distinct pattern of gene activity related to DNA repair and stress response. This pattern appeared only in people in the early phase of Parkinson's disease. It was not seen in healthy individuals or in patients who had already developed motor symptoms.\n\n\"This means that we have found an important window of opportunity in which the disease can be detected before motor symptoms caused by nerve damage in the brain appear. The fact that these patterns only show at an early stage and are no longer activated when the disease has progressed further also makes it interesting to focus on the mechanisms to find future treatments,\" says Annikka Polster, Assistant Professor at the Department of Life Sciences at Chalmers, who led the study.\n\nWhy Blood-Based Testing Matters\n\nScientists around the world have been searching for reliable early indicators of Parkinson's disease, including markers found through brain imaging and spinal fluid analysis. However, none of these approaches has yet led to a validated screening test suitable for widespread use before symptoms begin.\n\n\"In our study, we highlighted biomarkers that likely reflect some of the early biology of the disease and showed they can be measured in blood. This paves the way for broad screening tests via blood samples: a cost-effective, easily accessible method,\" says Polster.\n\nBlood Tests Could Reach Healthcare Within Years\n\nThe next phase of the research will focus on understanding exactly how these early biological mechanisms work and on developing tools that make them easier to detect.\n\nThe researchers estimate that within five years, blood tests designed to identify Parkinson's disease at an early stage could begin to be tested in healthcare systems. Over the longer term, the findings may also support the development of treatments aimed at slowing or preventing the disease.\n\n\"If we can study the mechanisms as they happen, it could provide important keys to understanding how they can be stopped and which drugs might be effective. This may involve new drugs, but also drug repurposing, where we can use drugs developed for diseases other than Parkinson's because the same gene activities or mechanisms are active,\" says Polster.\n\nMore About the Scientific Article\n\nThe study Longitudinal assessment of DNA repair signature trajectory in prodromal versus established Parkinson's disease has been published in npj Parkinson's Disease. The authors are Danish Anwer, Nicola Pietro Montaldo, Elva Maria Novoa-del-Toro, Diana Domanska, Hilde Loge Nilsen and Annikka Polster. The researchers work at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and Oslo University Hospital, Norway.\n\nThe research has been funded by Chalmers Health Engineering Area of Advance, Sweden, the Michael J Fox Foundation, the Research Council of Norway, NAISS (National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden) and the Swedish Research Council.\n\nMore About Parkinson's Disease\n\nParkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that interferes with the brain's ability to control movement. It progresses slowly and most often begins after the age of 55 -- 60. Parkinson's is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, after Alzheimer's disease. More than 10 million people have been diagnosed globally, and that number is projected to more than double by 2050.\n\nSources: The Swedish Parkinson's Association, The BMJ, global projection study, 2024\n\nParkinson's Disease Symptoms and Progression\n\nEarly symptoms\n\nREM sleep behavior disorder: The person acts out dreams during REM sleep, often with movements or sounds.\n\nReduced sense of smell\n\nConstipation\n\nDepression\n\nAnxiety\n\nMotor symptoms later in the disease",

      "content": "Interval cancers are aggressive tumours that grow during the interval after someone has been screened for cancer and before they are screened again, and AI seems to be able to identify them at an early stage\n\nSpotting cancer tumours in mammograms seems to be easier with AI AMELIE-BENOIST/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty\n\nPeople who are screened for breast cancer by AI-supported radiologists are less likely to develop aggressive cancers before their next screening round than those who are screened by radiologists alone, raising hopes that AI-assisted screening could save lives.\n\n“This is the first randomised controlled trial on the use of AI in mammography screening,” says Kristina Lång at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nThe AI-supported approach involves using the software – which has been trained on more than 200,000 mammography scans from 10 countries – to rank the likelihood of cancer being present in mammograms on a scale of 1 to 10, based on visual patterns in the scans. The scans receiving a score of 1 to 9 are then assessed by one experienced radiologist, while scans receiving a score of 10 – indicating cancer is most likely to be present – are assessed by two experienced radiologists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn earlier study found that this approach could detect 29 per cent more cancers than standard screening, where each mammogram is assessed by two radiologists, without increasing the rate of false detections – where a growth is flagged but follow-up tests reveal it isn’t actually there or wouldn’t go on to cause problems. “That was terrific,” says Fiona Gilbert at the University of Cambridge, who wasn’t involved in the trial.\n\nNow, Lång and her colleagues have found that the AI approach also reduces the likelihood of people developing so-called interval cancers. These are tumours that develop rapidly in the time interval between screenings – hence the name – and that consequently tend to be particularly aggressive and more likely to spread elsewhere in the body.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nLång and her colleagues made the discovery during an analysis of more than 100,000 women in Sweden, aged 55 on average. They randomly assigned about half of the women to receive their standard round of breast cancer screening, where each mammogram is assessed by two radiologists. The remaining participants were screened initially by the AI model – which was developed by biotech firm ScreenPoint Medical in Nijmegen, the Netherlands – and then the scans were assessed by radiologists, most of whom had at least five years of experience in analysing mammograms.\n\nThe women who received the AI-assisted screening were 12 per cent less likely, on average, to develop an interval cancer than the women who received the standard screening. “When we got the results, we were extremely thrilled,” says Lång.\n\nThis result may be down to the fact that the AI is better able to detect cancers at a very early stage. So while radiologists might overlook small tumours that would develop into an interval cancer, the AI can spot them.\n\nEven so, the study was only designed to explore whether AI can work as well as standard screening, not to see if it can perform better, meaning further trials are needed to confirm it really is superior, says Lång.\n\nWhat’s more, the team didn’t assess whether the AI-supported approach performs better in certain ethnic groups. Further trials, including an ongoing trial in the UK, will help to address this, says Gilbert.\n\nResearch should also be conducted to test whether less experienced radiologists see the same benefit when using AI, but Gilbert doesn’t expect a huge difference.\n\nOff the back of these results, Lång expects the AI approach to be rolled out across south-west Sweden, where the trial was performed, within a few months. But it will probably take about five years for other countries to complete similar trials that justify the roll-out elsewhere, says Gilbert. “Countries need to see what the impact is on their own population, where people are screened more or less often, and are of different ethnicities,” she says.\n\nThey also need to establish whether the AI approach is cost-effective. By some estimates, AI assistance may be worth investing in if it cuts interval cancer rates by at least 5 per cent. Radiologists will also need to be trained, although that probably won’t be too cumbersome as the software is fairly easy to use, says Lång.\n\nIt’s important to note that, even as AI improves, breast screening should always involve radiologists, says Lång. “Women that participate in screening say they do not want to have AI as a standalone tool, they want to have a human in the loop, and I agree with them. I think it’s very important that it’s a tool for radiologists,” she says.",

The AI looks at scans and ranks how likely cancer is to be present. Scans with the highest risk get checked by two radiologists, while others are checked by one.

Altering the gut microbiome has knock-on effects on the immune system, which seemed to help stabilise tumours in a small trial of people with kidney cancer.\n\nFaecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a safe procedure that involves transferring stool samples from one person to the gut of another, with the hope it will improve their microbiome. It is approved for treating recurrent antibiotic-resistant Clostridioides difficile infections in the UK and the US, and has shown promise for other conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen treating cancer, immunotherapy drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors can be effective by helping the immune system destroy cancer cells, but they don’t work for everyone. Prior studies suggest that an FMT from people who respond to these drugs to the guts of those who don’t can be beneficial. “The microbiome is a strong regulator of host immunity, so we hypothesise that altering it can boost immunity to help kill cancer,” says Gianluca Ianiro at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, Italy.\n\nBut such studies typically focused on melanoma, a type of skin cancer, and didn’t compare the effects of faecal transplants to a placebo. To address these limitations, Ianiro and his colleagues recruited 45 adults with kidney cancer who had started taking the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab plus axitinib, a drug that disrupts tumours’ blood supply, within the past two months.\n\nThey then randomly assigned the participants to receive either a stool transplant – collected from a man who went into remission from cancer after receiving checkpoint inhibitors – or a saline solution, both delivered into the large intestine via a small tube through the anus.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better.

What’s more, just over half of those in the FMT group saw their tumours shrink, compared with only around a third in the placebo group.\n\n“This meaningfully strengthens the evidence that the gut microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated to influence immunotherapy outcomes,” says Hassane Zarour at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.\n\nExactly how the faecal transplantation may have helped is unclear, but analysis of stool samples collected from participants before and after the FMT suggests that it introduced a species of gut bacteria called Blautia wexlerae, which produces short-chain fatty acids known to promote anti-cancer immune cells.\n\nThe faecal transplants also seemed to alter levels of bacteria already present in the recipients’ guts. For instance, they reduced levels of a strain of Escherichia coli that promotes harmful inflammation and raised levels of Ruminococcus bromii, which encourages the growth of other bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids.\n\nThe findings chime with another small trial out this week that showed FMT can substantially boost the effects of checkpoint inhibitors in people with non-small cell lung cancer, compared to those on the immunotherapy alone.\n\nThese trials suggest that FMTs could also work against other tumour types that respond to checkpoint inhibitors – such as those affecting the bladder and head and neck – but large, randomised-controlled trials are needed to confirm this, says Arielle Elkrief at the University of Montreal in Canada, who was involved in the non-small cell lung cancer trial.\n\nFurther research also needs to establish exactly which bacterial strains within faeces are beneficial, which could enable the creation of artificial microbial samples that can be produced for cancer treatment on a large scale, says Ianiro.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Some cancer treatments called checkpoint inhibitors help the immune system fight cancer, but they don’t work for everyone. Scientists have been exploring if changing the bacteria in the gut could make these treatments work better.\n\n**What happened** – A study tested faecal microbiota transplants (FMT), which transfer stool bacteria from one person to another, on 45 adults with kidney cancer. Half received a transplant from a patient who had good results with immunotherapy, while the others got a placebo. The transplant was given through the large intestine and later as pills.\n\n**Impact** – Patients who received the faecal transplant had their cancer stay stable for about two years, compared to nine months for the placebo group. More than half of the transplant group saw their tumors shrink, showing that gut bacteria can help improve cancer treatment. The study also found that helpful bacteria increased, while harmful ones decreased in the patients’ guts.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers want to run larger studies to confirm these results and figure out exactly which bacteria help fight cancer. This could lead to specially made bacterial treatments that support cancer drugs for more people.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Changing gut bacteria through faecal transplants can boost the success of kidney cancer immunotherapy and may improve cancer treatment in the future.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Certains traitements contre le cancer appelés inhibiteurs de point de contrôle aident le système immunitaire à combattre le cancer, mais ne fonctionnent pas chez tout le monde. Des scientifiques étudient si modifier les bactéries dans l’intestin peut rendre ces traitements plus efficaces.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Une étude a testé les transplantations de microbiote fécal (TMF), qui transfèrent les bactéries d’une personne à une autre, sur 45 adultes atteints d’un cancer du rein. La moitié a reçu un transplant provenant d’un patient ayant bien répondu à l’immunothérapie, l’autre moitié un placebo. Le transplant a été donné par l’intestin puis sous forme de pilules.\n\n**Impact** – Les patients ayant reçu la transplantation ont vu leur cancer stabilisé pendant environ deux ans, contre neuf mois pour le groupe placebo. Plus de la moitié du groupe transplanté a vu ses tumeurs rétrécir, montrant que les bactéries intestinales peuvent aider à améliorer le traitement du cancer. L’étude a aussi montré une augmentation des bactéries bénéfiques et une diminution des bactéries nuisibles.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – Les chercheurs souhaitent réaliser des études plus larges pour confirmer ces résultats et identifier précisément quelles bactéries combattent le cancer. Cela pourrait permettre de créer des traitements bactériens spécifiques pour soutenir les médicaments anticancéreux.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – Modifier les bactéries intestinales par des transplantations fécales peut renforcer l’efficacité de l’immunothérapie contre le cancer du rein et améliorer les traitements à l’avenir.",
