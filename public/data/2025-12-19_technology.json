NASA / Mark Knopp\n\nThe airliner you board in the future could look a lot different from today’s, with longer, thinner wings that provide a smoother ride while saving fuel.\n\nThose wings would be a revolutionary design for commercial aircraft, but like any breakthrough technology, they come with their own development challenges – which experts from NASA and Boeing are now working to solve.\n\nWhen creating lift, longer, thinner wings can reduce drag, making them efficient. However, they can become very flexible in flight.\n\nThrough their Integrated Adaptive Wing Technology Maturation collaboration, NASA and Boeing recently completed wind tunnel tests of a “higher aspect ratio wing model” looking for ways to get the efficiency gains without the potential issues these kinds of wings can experience.\n\n“When you have a very flexible wing, you’re getting into greater motions,” said Jennifer Pinkerton, a NASA aerospace engineer at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. “Things like gust loads and maneuver loads can cause even more of an excitation than with a smaller aspect ratio wing. Higher aspect ratio wings also tend to be more fuel efficient, so we’re trying to take advantage of that while simultaneously controlling the aeroelastic response.”\n\nTake a minute to watch this video about the testing NASA and Boeing are doing on longer, narrower aircraft wings.\n\nWithout the right engineering, long, thin wings could potentially bend or experience a condition known as wing flutter, causing aircraft to vibrate and shake in gusting winds.\n\n“Flutter is a very violent interaction,” Pinkerton said. “When the flow over a wing interacts with the aircraft structure and the natural frequencies of the wing are excited, wing oscillations are amplified and can grow exponentially, leading to potentially catastrophic failure. Part of the testing we do is to characterize aeroelastic instabilities like flutter for aircraft concepts so that in actual flight, those instabilities can be safely avoided.”\n\nTo help demonstrate and understand this, researchers from NASA and Boeing sought to soften the impacts of wind gusts on the aircraft, lessen the wing loads from aircraft turns and movements, and suppress wing flutter.\n\nReducing or controlling those factors can have a significant impact on an aircraft’s performance, fuel efficiency, and passenger comfort.\n\nTesting for this in a controlled environment is impossible with a full-sized commercial airliner, as no wind tunnel could accommodate one.\n\nHowever, NASA Langley’s Transonic Dynamics Tunnel, which has been contributing to the design of U.S. commercial transports, military aircraft, launch vehicles, and spacecraft for over 60 years, features a test section 16 feet high by 16 feet wide, big enough for large-scale models.\n\nTo shrink a full-size plane down to scale, NASA and Boeing worked with NextGen Aeronautics, which designed and fabricated a complex model resembling an aircraft divided down the middle, with one 13-foot wing.\n\nMounted to the wall of the wind tunnel, the model was outfitted with 10 control surfaces – moveable panels – along the wing’s rear edge. Researchers adjusted those control surfaces to control airflow and reduce the forces that were causing the wing to vibrate.\n\nInstruments and sensors mounted inside the model measured the forces acting on the model, as well as the vehicle’s responses.\n\nAnother view of the Integrated Adaptive Wing Technology Maturation wind-tunnel model installed in the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. NASA / Mark Knopp\n\nThe model wing represented a leap in sophistication from a smaller one developed during a previous NASA-Boeing collaboration called the Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR).\n\n“The SUGAR model had two active control surfaces,” said Patrick S. Heaney, principal investigator at NASA for the Integrated Adaptive Wing Technology Maturation collaboration. “And now on this particular model we have ten. We’re increasing the complexity as well as expanding what our control objectives are.”\n\nA first set of tests, conducted in 2024, gave experts baseline readings that they compared to NASA computational simulations, allowing them to refine their models. A second set of tests in 2025 used the additional control surfaces in new configurations.\n\nThe most visible benefits of these new capabilities appeared during testing to alleviate the forces from gusting winds, when researchers saw the wing’s shaking greatly reduced.\n\nWith testing completed, NASA and Boeing experts are analyzing data and preparing to share their results with the aviation community. Airlines and original equipment manufacturers can learn and benefit from the lessons learned, deciding which to apply to the next generation of aircraft.\n\n“Initial data analyses have shown that controllers developed by NASA and Boeing and used during the test demonstrated large performance improvements,” Heaney said. “We’re excited to continue analyzing the data and sharing results in the months to come.”\n\nNASA’s Advanced Air Transport Technology project works to advance aircraft design and technology under the agency’s Advanced Air Vehicles program, which studies, evaluates, and develops technologies and capabilities for new aircraft systems.

      "title": "Scientists spent 10 years chasing a particle that wasn’t there",
      "summary": "After a decade of painstaking measurements, scientists have delivered a major plot twist in particle physics: a long-hypothesized “mystery particle” likely doesn’t exist. Using the MicroBooNE experiment at Fermilab, researchers analyzed neutrinos from two powerful beams and found no evidence for a sterile neutrino, ruling it out with 95% certainty.",
      "content": "After ten years of gathering and studying data, an international team of physicists that included researchers from Rutgers has overturned a long-standing idea about a mysterious type of particle.\n\nThe results were published in Nature and come from the MicroBooNE experiment at the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois. (The acronym MicroBooNE stands for \"Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment.\")\n\nA Decade-Long Test at Fermilab\n\nMicroBooNE relies on a large liquid-argon detector and observations from two separate neutrino beams. By carefully tracking how neutrinos behave, scientists were able to rule out the existence of a single sterile neutrino with 95% certainty.\n\nAndrew Mastbaum, an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences and a member of the MicroBooNE leadership team, described the finding as a major shift for the field.\n\n\"This result will spark innovative ideas across neutrino research to understand what is really going on,\" he said. \"We can rule out a great suspect, but that doesn't quite solve a mystery.\"\n\nWhy Neutrinos Matter\n\nNeutrinos are extremely small particles that rarely interact with matter. They can travel straight through entire planets without slowing down. According to the Standard Model, which is the leading framework in particle physics, there are three known types of neutrinos: electron, muon and tau. These particles can transform from one type to another through a phenomenon known as oscillation.\n\nIn earlier experiments, however, scientists observed neutrino behavior that did not fully match the predictions of the Standard Model. To explain those results, researchers suggested the existence of a fourth type of neutrino called the sterile neutrino. Unlike the known types, a sterile neutrino would not interact with matter at all, except through gravity, making it exceptionally difficult to detect.\n\nPutting the Sterile Neutrino to the Test\n\nTo investigate this idea, the MicroBooNE team measured neutrinos produced by two different beams and analyzed how they changed as they traveled. After ten years of collecting and interpreting data, the researchers found no evidence supporting the sterile neutrino hypothesis. This effectively shuts down one of the most widely discussed explanations for unusual neutrino behavior.\n\nMastbaum played a central role in guiding the experiment's analysis efforts as co-coordinator for analysis tools and techniques. His work focused on how raw detector signals were converted into meaningful scientific conclusions. He also previously led efforts to understand what the team calls systematic uncertainties, which are possible sources of error in the measurements.\n\nThese uncertainties include how neutrinos interact with atomic nuclei, the exact number of neutrinos in the beam and how the detector itself responds to incoming particles. Accurately accounting for these factors is essential for drawing firm conclusions from the data.\n\nGetting these uncertainties right is critical because it allows scientists to make strong, reliable statements about what the data really shows, Mastbaum said.\n\nGraduate Researchers and Data Accuracy\n\nGraduate students from Rutgers also contributed to the project. Panagiotis Englezos, a doctoral student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences, worked on the MicroBooNE Data Management Team, helping process experimental data and create simulations that supported the analysis.\n\nKeng Lin, another doctoral student in the department, focused on validating the neutrino flux from Fermilab's NuMI (Neutrinos from the Main Injector) beam, which was one of the two neutrino sources used in the study. Together, these efforts helped ensure the precision and reliability of the final results.\n\nWhat This Means for Physics\n\nAccording to Mastbaum, the finding is significant because it removes a major candidate for new physics beyond the Standard Model. While the Standard Model has been highly successful, it does not explain phenomena such as dark matter, dark energy or gravity. Researchers continue to search for clues that point beyond the model, and eliminating one possibility helps narrow the field.\n\nRutgers scientists also helped advance methods for measuring how neutrinos interact in liquid argon. These improved techniques will benefit future projects, including the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).\n\n\"With careful modeling and clever analysis approaches, the MicroBooNE team has squeezed an incredible amount of information out of this detector,\" Mastbaum said. \"With the next generation of experiments, such as DUNE, we are already using these techniques to address even more fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the existence of the universe.\"",

      "content": "One in three using AI for emotional support and conversation, UK says\n\n16 hours ago Share Save Chris Vallance Senior technology reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nOne in three adults in the UK are using artificial intelligence (AI) for emotional support or social interaction, according to research published by a government body. And one in 25 people turned to the tech for support or conversation every day, the AI Security Institute (AISI) said in its first report. The report is based on two years of testing the abilities of more than 30 unnamed advanced AIs - covering areas critical to security, including cyber skills, chemistry and biology. The government said AISI's work would support its future plans by helping companies fix problems \"before their AI systems are widely used\".\n\nA survey by AISI of over 2,000 UK adults found people were primarily using chatbots like ChatGPT for emotional support or social interaction, followed by voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa. Researchers also analysed what happened to an online community of more than two million Reddit users dedicated to discussing AI companions, when the tech failed. The researchers found when the chatbots went down, people reported self-described \"symptoms of withdrawal\", such as feeling anxious or depressed - as well as having disrupted sleep or neglecting their responsibilities.\n\nDoubling cyber skills\n\nAs well as the emotional impact of AI use, AISI researchers looked at other risks caused by the tech's accelerating capabilities. There is considerable concern about AI enabling cyber attacks, but equally it can be used to help secure systems from hackers. Its ability to spot and exploit security flaws was in some cases \"doubling every eight months\", the report suggests. And AI systems were also beginning to complete expert-level cyber tasks which would typically require over 10 years of experience. Researchers also found the tech's impact in science was also growing rapidly. In 2025, AI models had \"long since exceeded human biology experts with PhDs - with performance in chemistry quickly catching up\".\n\n'Humans losing control'\n\nFrom novels such as Isaac Asimov's I, Robot to modern video games like Horizon: Zero Dawn, sci-fi has long imagined what would happen if AI broke free of human control. Now, according to the report, the \"worst-case scenario\" of humans losing control of advanced AI systems is \"taken seriously by many experts\". AI models are increasingly exhibiting some of the capabilities required to self-replicate across the internet, controlled lab tests suggested. AISI examined whether models could carry out simple versions of tasks needed in the early stages of self-replication - such as \"passing know-your customer checks required to access financial services\" in order to successfully purchase the computing on which their copies would run. But the research found to be able to do this in the real world, AI systems would need to complete several such actions in sequence \"while remaining undetected\", something its research suggests they currently lack the capacity to do. Institute experts also looked at the possibility of models \"sandbagging\" - or strategically hiding their true capabilities from testers. They found tests showed it was possible, but there was no evidence of this type of subterfuge taking place. In May, AI firm Anthropic released a controversial report which described how an AI model was capable of seemingly blackmail-like behaviour if it thought its \"self-preservation\" was threatened. The threat from rogue AI is, however, a source of profound disagreement among leading researchers - many of whom feel it is exaggerated.\n\n'Universal jailbreaks'",
