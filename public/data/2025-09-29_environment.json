      "title": "Why “dry” oil wells aren’t really empty",
      "summary": "Oil wells often dry up far earlier than predicted, leaving companies baffled about the “missing” reserves. A Penn State team tackled this puzzle by harnessing PSC’s Bridges-2 supercomputer, adding a time dimension and amplitude analysis to traditional seismic data. Their findings revealed hidden rock structures blocking oil flow, meaning reserves weren’t gone—they were trapped.",
      "content": "A common problem with oil wells is that they can run dry even when sound-based measurements say there's still oil there. A team from Penn State University used PSC's flagship Bridges-2 supercomputer to add a time dimension to these seismic measurements, as well as to analyze how oil damps down the loudness of sound traveling through it. Their preliminary analysis suggests that hidden rock structures in oil reserves prevent all the oil from being pumped out. They're now scaling up their work to tackle realistically sized oil fields.\n\nWhy It's Important\n\nGiven all the complexity of finding oil in more remote and deeper locations, we need to drill smarter. Waste was always expensive, but today it's particularly important to be as clean and efficient as oil and gas extraction can be.\n\nExperts use the movement of sound through the Earth to spot where oil deposits should be. Those measurements also tell us the approximate size of a given reserve. Still, it's common for a well to go dry after only a fraction of its suspected oil has been pumped out. Penn State's Tieyuan Zhu and his students and postdoctoral fellows wanted to understand why that is -- and to develop more accurate measurements of how much oil a given well will actually produce.\n\n\"We actually tested … data from the North Sea. You know, they started drilling in 2008 and based on their estimation … they could produce oil for 20 years, 30 years. But unfortunately, after two years, there was nothing. Their well is dry. They just got confused. Where is the oil? Gone? The big issue actually is the complexity of the geology in the reservoir.\" -- Tieyuan Zhu, Penn State\n\nThe team's approach, studying more aspects of the data from sound measurements than previously employed, would require more computing power. Also, they would need large memory to store parts of the problem in the computer's processors without time-costly trips back to data storage. PSC's NSF-funded Bridges-2 was the answer to this problem, thanks to an allocation from ACCESS, the NSF network of computing sites.\n\nHow PSC Helped\n\nOil doesn't sit in pools underground. When it's present, it's soaked into porous rock. Solid rock transmits sound more readily than oil-drenched rock. So experts can spot oil reserves by the way they slow down sound traveling through them. Much like a medical ultrasound, these seismic methods produce 3D images of where that oil-sodden rock sits.\n\nDespite those sophisticated maps, though, wells drilled based on those images often come up short. Zhu's team reasoned that there were literally parts of the picture that the 3D imaging wasn't capturing. They suspected that obtaining images of the same reserves on different dates -- adding time to create a kind of 4D animation -- would help build a more accurate picture.\n\nAnother piece of the puzzle would be to include more features of the seismic data in the analysis. Previously, oil reserves were spotted by the longer amount of time it takes sound to move through them. To this time data, the Penn State scientists added the amplitude of the signal -- how oil damped out its loudness.\n\nThis all posed computational problems. The computer would need lots of fast processors to crunch the calculations in a reasonable amount of time. But it would also need to temporarily store parts of the problem in its memory -- like RAM in a laptop -- so that it didn't need to keep going back to read the stored data, which slows everything down. Bridges-2, with over a thousand powerful central processing units (CPUs) in its regular memory nodes, could provide the speed. It could also provide the memory, as its CPU nodes each feature between 256 and 512 gigabytes of RAM -- eight to 16 times as much as a high-end gaming laptop.\n\n\"We have two postdocs and also one graduate student using Bridges-2 … the first phase of using Bridges-2 was to parallelize our research code … and make it more practical … The second phase is really to implement the code to the field data … PSC guaranteed me a hundred thousand computing hours, and also the memory to store my data, my field data … That just cannot be achieved with our local [resources].\" -- Tieyuan Zhu, Penn State\n\nThe team's repeated measurements and expanded analysis yielded paydirt. They found that the images mapped out by time alone, in a single measurement, missed structures within the oil reserve. Some of these structures, such as a layer of more solid rock within the reserve, wouldn't affect the speed of the sound enough to be detected. But it would prevent a well from sucking up the oil below it. The solution, in some cases, was simple. Drill a little deeper, and the rest of the oil would be accessible. The scientists reported their results in the journal Geophysics in September, 2024, with a more extensive result in the same journal in April, 2025.\n\nThe current report was just a proof of concept for their approach in a limited geological area, about 9 square miles. Currently, the team is expanding their computations to more nodes, so that the method can produce accurate maps for much larger areas, dozens of square miles. Another option Zhu's group may explore in scaling up their work is using Bridges-2's extreme memory nodes, which have 4,000 gigabytes of RAM apiece.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Oil companies often find that wells dry up much earlier than expected, even when measurements suggest there should still be oil underground. This has puzzled experts and led to wasted time and money.\n\n**What happened** – A team from Penn State University used a powerful supercomputer called Bridges-2 to study oil wells in a new way. They added a time factor and looked at how sound waves lose strength when passing through oil. This helped them find hidden rock layers blocking oil flow. Their work showed that the oil wasn’t gone—it was trapped by these unknown barriers.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery explains why wells can seem empty too soon and shows that drilling a bit deeper or differently could access more oil. It also means oil companies can plan better and waste less. Using the supercomputer made it possible to analyze very large and complex data sets quickly, which was not possible before.\n\n**What’s next step** – The team is now working on applying their method to much larger oil fields. They plan to use even more powerful parts of the supercomputer to handle bigger areas and more detailed data. This could lead to smarter drilling and less wasted oil worldwide.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – By using advanced computer analysis, scientists found hidden rock barriers that trap oil underground, explaining why some wells dry up early and showing how to get more oil efficiently.",

      "summary": "The architect “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”",
      "content": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nFerraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work:\n\nFoi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025\n\nIt was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows.\n\nYu’s legacy\n\nYu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.”\n\nOn its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”\n\nSponge cities concept\n\nYu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China.\n\nYu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nYu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018.\n\nIn the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n\nSo far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nOn X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city:\n\nOn September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan]\n\nYu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years.\n\nA journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform:\n\n🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

Cependant, les récents débats entre pays de l'UE ont montré des désaccords sur les plans futurs de réduction des émissions.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – L'Agence européenne pour l'environnement (AEE) a publié un rapport indiquant que, bien que l'Europe ait réduit ses émissions de 37 % et les décès liés à la pollution de l'air de 45 %, l'état général de l'environnement reste mauvais. Le rapport montre que de nombreuses zones naturelles et ressources en eau se dégradent, et que les effets du changement climatique, comme les vagues de chaleur, augmentent, causant des problèmes de santé et économiques.\n\n**Impact** – Ce rapport est important car il donne des faits clairs sur les progrès et les défis environnementaux en Europe. Il montre que, même si l'Europe est en avance sur d'autres grands pollueurs, elle doit faire plus pour protéger la nature, mieux gérer l'eau, et se préparer aux impacts climatiques. Par exemple, 81 % des habitats protégés sont en mauvais état et beaucoup de bâtiments ne résistent pas à la chaleur extrême.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L'AEE appelle les pays de l'UE à renforcer les politiques existantes dans le cadre du Pacte vert européen et à améliorer leur adaptation au changement climatique. Cela inclut une meilleure utilisation de l'eau, plus de plans de santé pour les vagues de chaleur, et une action plus rapide pour éviter des coûts plus élevés liés aux dégâts et aux problèmes de santé.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – L'Europe a fait de grands progrès pour réduire les émissions, mais elle doit agir plus vite et plus fort pour protéger son environnement et faire face aux effets croissants du changement climatique.",

Sin embargo, recientes debates entre países de la UE mostraron desacuerdos sobre planes futuros para reducir más las emisiones.\n\n**Qué pasó** – La Agencia Europea de Medio Ambiente (AEMA) publicó un informe que indica que, aunque Europa ha reducido sus emisiones en un 37 % y las muertes relacionadas con la contaminación del aire en un 45 %, el estado general del medio ambiente sigue siendo malo. El informe muestra que muchas áreas naturales y fuentes de agua se están deteriorando, y que los efectos del cambio climático, como las olas de calor, están aumentando, causando problemas de salud y económicos.\n\n**Impacto** – Este informe es importante porque ofrece datos claros sobre los avances y retos ambientales en Europa. Muestra que, aunque Europa va por delante de otros grandes contaminantes, debe hacer más para proteger la naturaleza, gestionar mejor el agua y prepararse para los impactos del clima. Por ejemplo, el 81 % de los hábitats protegidos están en mal estado y muchos edificios no soportan el calor extremo.\n\n**Próximo paso** – La AEMA insta a los países de la UE a reforzar las políticas existentes bajo el Pacto Verde Europeo y mejorar su adaptación al cambio climático. Esto incluye un mejor uso del agua, más planes de salud para olas de calor y acciones más rápidas para evitar costos mayores por daños y problemas de salud.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Europa ha logrado grandes avances en la reducción de emisiones, pero necesita actuar más rápido y con más fuerza para proteger su medio ambiente y prepararse ante los crecientes efectos del cambio climático.",
