      "summary": "A newly developed AI can predict which diseases specific genetic mutations are likely to cause, not just whether they are harmful. The breakthrough could speed up diagnoses and open new paths for personalized treatment.",
      "content": "Scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have created a new artificial intelligence system that can do more than flag harmful genetic mutations. The tool can also forecast the types of diseases those mutations are most likely to cause.\n\nThe approach, known as V2P (Variant to Phenotype), is intended to speed up genetic testing and support the development of new therapies for rare and complex illnesses. The research was published in the December 15 online issue of Nature Communications.\n\nPredicting disease from genetic variation\n\nMost existing genetic analysis tools are able to estimate whether a mutation is potentially damaging, but they typically stop there. They do not explain what kind of disease may result. V2P is designed to overcome this limitation by using advanced machine learning to connect genetic variants with their expected phenotypic outcomes -- meaning the diseases or traits a mutation may produce. In this way, the system helps predict how a person's DNA could affect their health.\n\n\"Our approach allows us to pinpoint the genetic changes that are most relevant to a patient's condition, rather than sifting through thousands of possible variants,\" says first author David Stein, PhD, who recently completed his doctoral training in the labs of Yuval Itan, PhD, and Avner Schlessinger, PhD. \"By determining not only whether a variant is pathogenic but also the type of disease it is likely to cause, we can improve both the speed and accuracy of genetic interpretation and diagnostics.\"\n\nTraining the AI to find the right mutation\n\nTo build the model, the researchers trained V2P on a large dataset containing both harmful and harmless genetic variants, along with detailed disease information. This training allowed the system to learn patterns linking specific variants to health outcomes. When tested using real, de-identified patient data, V2P frequently ranked the true disease-causing mutation within the top 10 candidates, demonstrating its potential to simplify and accelerate genetic diagnosis.\n\n\"Beyond diagnostics, V2P could help researchers and drug developers identify the genes and pathways most closely linked to specific diseases,\" says Dr. Schlessinger, co-senior and co-corresponding author, Professor of Pharmacological Sciences, and Director of the AI Small Molecule Drug Discovery Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"This can guide the development of therapies that are genetically tailored to the mechanisms of disease, particularly in rare and complex conditions.\"\n\nExpanding precision medicine and drug discovery\n\nAt present, V2P sorts mutations into broad disease categories, such as nervous system disorders or cancers. The research team plans to enhance the system so it can make more detailed predictions and combine its results with additional data sources to further assist drug discovery.\n\nThe researchers say this advance marks meaningful progress toward precision medicine, where treatments are selected based on an individual's genetic profile. By linking genetic variants to their likely disease effects, V2P could help clinicians reach diagnoses faster and help scientists uncover new targets for therapy.\n\n\"V2P gives us a clearer window into how genetic changes translate into disease, which has important implications for both research and patient care,\" says Dr. Itan, co-senior and co-corresponding author, Associate Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health, and Genetics and Genomic Sciences, a core member of The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, and a member of The Mindich Child Health and Development Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"By connecting specific variants to the types of diseases they are most likely to cause, we can better prioritize which genes and pathways warrant deeper investigation. This helps us move more efficiently from understanding the biology to identifying potential therapeutic approaches and, ultimately, tailoring interventions to an individual's specific genomic profile.\"\n\nThe paper is titled \"Expanding the utility of variant effect predictions with phenotype-specific models.\"\n\nThe study's authors, as listed in the journal, are David Stein, Meltem Ece Kars, Baptiste Milisavljevic, Matthew Mort, Peter D.

      "title": "A new way to prevent gum disease without wiping out good bacteria",
      "summary": "Scientists are uncovering a surprising way to influence bacteria—not by killing them, but by changing how they communicate. Researchers studying oral bacteria found that disrupting chemical signals used in bacterial “conversations” can shift dental plaque toward healthier, less harmful communities. The discovery could open the door to new treatments that prevent disease by maintaining a balanced microbiome rather than wiping bacteria out entirely.",
      "content": "All living organisms adapt in order to survive, and bacteria are no exception. Over many decades, some bacteria have gradually become resistant to widely used antibiotics and disinfectants, creating serious challenges for medicine and public health. At the same time, countless bacterial species play a helpful and often critical role in keeping the human body healthy. This raises an important question. Instead of trying to eliminate bacteria, could scientists find ways to influence how they behave to reduce disease and improve health?\n\nBacteria are far from silent. Inside the human mouth, roughly 700 different bacterial species constantly exchange information through a process called quorum sensing. This chemical communication allows bacteria to coordinate their actions as a group. Many oral bacteria rely on signaling molecules known as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) to send and receive these messages.\n\nInvestigating Bacterial Communication in Dental Plaque\n\nResearchers at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities College of Biological Sciences and the School of Dentistry set out to explore how bacteria in the mouth communicate and whether that communication could be deliberately disrupted. Their goal was to determine if interfering with these signals could help prevent plaque buildup and support a healthier oral microbiome. The findings, published in the journal npj Biofilms and Microbiomes, suggest this approach could reshape how doctors think about treating bacterial diseases.\n\nKey Findings From the Study\n\nThe researchers discovered several important patterns in how oral bacteria communicate and organize themselves:\n\nBacteria in dental plaque generate AHL signals in oxygen-rich areas (such as above the gumline), and those signals can be detected by bacteria living in oxygen-poor regions (beneath the gumline).\n\nEliminating AHL signals using specialized enzymes called lactonases led to an increase in bacterial species associated with good oral health.\n\nThese results indicate that carefully chosen enzymes might be used to reshape dental plaque communities and help maintain a healthy balance of microbes.\n\nDental Plaque as a Living Ecosystem\n\n\"Dental plaque develops in a sequence, much like a forest ecosystem,\" said Mikael Elias, associate professor in the College of Biological Sciences and senior author of the study. \"Pioneer species like Streptococcus and Actinomyces are the initial settlers in simple communities -- they're generally harmless and associated with good oral health. Increasingly diverse late colonizers include the 'red complex' bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, which are strongly linked to periodontal disease. By disrupting the chemical signals bacteria use to communicate, one could manipulate the plaque community to remain or return to its health-associated stage.\"\n\n\"What's particularly striking is how oxygen availability changes everything,\" said lead author Rakesh Sikdar. \"When we blocked AHL signaling in aerobic conditions, we saw more health-associated bacteria. But when we added AHLs under anaerobic conditions, we promoted the growth of disease-associated late colonizers. Quorum sensing may play very different roles above and below the gumline, which has major implications for how we approach treatment of periodontal diseases.\"\n\nToward New Microbiome-Based Treatments\n\nThe researchers plan to next examine how bacterial signaling differs across various regions of the mouth and among patients at different stages of periodontal disease. \"Understanding how bacterial communities communicate and organize themselves may ultimately give us new tools to prevent periodontal disease -- not by waging war on all oral bacteria, but by strategically maintaining a healthy microbial balance,\" said Elias. The team believes this strategy could eventually lead to therapies for other parts of the body, where imbalances in the microbiome are linked to illness and certain forms of cancer.\n\nFunding for the research was provided by the National Institutes of Health.",

      "title": "Living cells may generate electricity from motion",
      "summary": "Cells may generate their own electrical signals through microscopic membrane motions. Researchers show that active molecular processes can create voltage spikes similar to those used by neurons. These signals could help drive ion transport and explain key biological functions. The work may also guide the design of intelligent, bio-inspired materials.",
      "content": "Scientists have developed a new theoretical explanation for how living cells might generate electricity on their own. At the center of the idea is the cell membrane, the thin, flexible layer that surrounds every living cell and controls what enters and leaves it. Rather than being a static barrier, this membrane is constantly moving and reshaping itself at very small scales. The new framework shows that these tiny motions can give rise to real electrical effects.\n\nThe research was led by Pradeep Sharma and his colleagues, who built a mathematical model to explore how physical forces inside cells interact with biological activity. Their work focuses on how motion at the molecular level can translate into electrical signals across the membrane.\n\nMolecular Activity That Makes Membranes Move\n\nInside every cell, proteins are constantly changing shape, interacting with other molecules, and carrying out chemical reactions. One important process is ATP hydrolysis, which is how cells break down adenosine triphosphate to release energy. These active biological processes do not happen quietly. They push and pull on the cell membrane, causing it to bend, ripple, and fluctuate.\n\nThe model shows that these ongoing membrane movements can trigger a phenomenon known as flexoelectricity. Flexoelectricity occurs when bending or deformation in a material produces an electrical response. In this case, the bending of the cell membrane can create an electrical difference between the inside and outside of the cell.\n\nVoltage Levels Comparable to Nerve Signals\n\nAccording to the framework, the electrical voltages created across the membrane can be surprisingly strong. In some cases, they can reach up to 90 millivolts. That level is notable because it is similar to the voltage changes seen in neurons when they fire electrical signals.\n\nThe timing also matches what happens in the nervous system. The voltage shifts can occur within milliseconds, which aligns closely with the shape and speed of typical action potential curves for neurons. This suggests that the same physical principles could play a role in how nerve cells communicate.\n\nDriving Ion Movement Against Natural Gradients\n\nThe theory goes further by predicting that these membrane driven voltages could actively move ions. Ions are electrically charged atoms that cells use to send signals and maintain balance. Normally, ions flow along electrochemical gradients, meaning they move from areas of high concentration to low concentration.\n\nThe new model suggests that active membrane fluctuations could push ions in the opposite direction, working against those gradients. The researchers connect this behavior to specific properties of the membrane, including how stretchy it is and how it responds to electric fields. These properties help determine which direction ions move and what type of charge they carry.\n\nFrom Single Cells to Tissues and New Materials\n\nLooking ahead, the authors suggest that this framework could be expanded beyond individual cells. By applying the same principles to groups of cells, scientists could explore how coordinated membrane activity leads to larger scale electrical patterns across tissues.\n\nThe researchers argue that this mechanism offers a physical foundation for understanding sensory perception, neuronal firing, and even how living cells might harvest energy internally. It may also help bridge neuroscience with the development of bio inspired and physically intelligent materials, offering new ways to design systems that mimic the electrical behavior of living tissue.",

WFP needs $468 million to help six million survive the winter.\n\nDR Congo violence pushes 500,000 from their homes\n\nUN agencies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) say more than half a million people have fled their homes in just the last few days, in eastern areas overrun by Rwanda-backed M23 fighters.\n\nTweet URL\n\n“No one should have to choose between safety and survival,” WFP said in an online post on Tuesday, as South Kivu province witnesses its most significant escalation of hostilities since the beginning of the year.\n\nTo help, the agency urgently needs $350 million to deliver life-saving food to communities impacted by decades of insecurity in the vast, resource-rich region.\n\nIn neighbouring Burundi, meanwhile, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, reported that around 64,000 refugees have arrived, and more are on their way.\n\nNeeds include medical assistance and shelter, the agency said. It also issued a warning about unaccompanied or separated children and the “high percentage” of women at risk among the newly displaced.\n\nOperations suspended\n\nFighting in parts of South Kivu has forced the suspension of all humanitarian operations in the towns of Fizi and Baraka, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Tuesday, amid reports of panic and looting by armed groups.\n\nLocal authorities estimate that around 110,000 people have been newly displaced since 8 December, many sheltering in public spaces without access to aid. Some have crossed into Burundi, while others are moving onwards towards Tanzania.\n\nAid deliveries are resuming gradually in Uvira and Bukavu, but OCHA warned that access remains fragile as needs continue to rise.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Chronic illnesses like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are among the top causes of death worldwide. At the same time, mental health conditions affect over a billion people globally. Until now, these health challenges have often been addressed separately.\n\n**What happened** – At the recent United Nations General Assembly, world leaders agreed on a historic declaration to tackle noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health together for the first time. This agreement, announced by the World Health Organization (WHO), sets clear targets to be met by 2030, such as reducing tobacco use, better controlling high blood pressure, and expanding access to mental health care.\n\n**Impact** – This joint commitment is important because it recognizes how connected physical and mental health are. By working on both at once, governments aim to improve the lives of millions and reduce the heavy costs these diseases place on families and economies. The WHO calls this a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to change global health for the better.\n\n**What's next step** – Countries will now strengthen their health policies, increase funding, and improve essential health services. Progress will be tracked regularly by the UN, with governments expected to show real results in the coming years.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – For the first time, world leaders have united to fight chronic diseases and mental health problems together, setting clear goals to improve health worldwide by 2030.",

En travaillant sur les deux en même temps, les gouvernements veulent améliorer la vie de millions de personnes et réduire le coût élevé de ces maladies pour les familles et les économies. L'OMS parle d'une « opportunité unique en une génération » pour changer la santé mondiale.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les pays vont renforcer leurs politiques de santé, augmenter les financements et améliorer les services essentiels.
