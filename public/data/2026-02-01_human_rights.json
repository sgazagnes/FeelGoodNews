      "summary": "A Buddhist pilgrimage in the U.S. and a solidarity walk in the U.K. use long-distance walking as a nonconfrontational form of public peace witness.",
      "content": "A group of 19 Theravada Buddhist monks and rescue dog Aloka departed Huong Dao Vipassana Bhavana Center from Fort Worth, Texas, on a fresh autumn morning during the later part of October 2025, launching a journey that the organizers say will last four months of walking and cover around 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles).\n\nThe planned route, a passage from Texas through Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas, is intended to end by mid-February on the West Lawn of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., where the group, led by Bhikkhu Pannakara, plans to demand the federal recognition of Vesak, the Buddhist holiday commemorating the birth and enlightenment of Siddhartha Gautama.\n\nThe organizers — the Huong Dao Vipassana Bhavana Center — presented the Walk for Peace as a pilgrimage inspired by Buddhist walking meditation and dhutanga practice, a monastic discipline generally aimed at developing simplicity, resilience, and mindfulness while travelling. The monks, rather than leading a demonstration with chants or placards, move slowly, often without shoes, touching the community through their silent, prayerful, and compassionate presence and through their teachings on compassion and inner calm.\n\nThey make stops in the towns and cities along their route, using public parks, churchyards, and open spaces for rest, and, in some cases, receive recognition from locals and media coverage.\n\nThe walk has caught the eye of many, with people following online. The group is highly visible on social media with a live map created by Dhammacetiya, a project website for a Buddhist initiative called “The Ancient Sacred Buddhist Scripture Stupas.” There are also frequent photo and video updates showing the monastics continuing their journey eastwards, local governments welcoming them, and the community writing about their path. Social media supporters have noted the broad appeal of the pilgrimage, with the monks’ Facebook page showing more than 60,000 followers at the time of writing.\n\nHowever, they have also encountered numerous difficulties, among them an incident in November 2025 when a support vehicle for the group was struck by a truck on United States Highway 90 near Dayton, Texas. Two monks sustained injuries, and one of them, Bhante Dam Phommasan, had to have a leg amputated. Meanwhile, the world was closely following their activities, and international aid flooded in as the group demonstrated their resolve to continue the walk despite this setback.\n\nWalking for peace has its roots in the ancient Buddhist tradition of pilgrimage, in which movement through public space has both spiritual and ethical meanings. Walking meditation, or cankama in Pali, was a technique of the Buddha and his first followers, emphasizing awareness of the action of walking. Dhutanga, one of the ascetic practices of Theravada Buddhism, comprises, among other practices, voluntary walking far and wide to develop detachment and love for all beings.\n\nIn the 20th century, figures like Thich Nhat Hanh and Maha Ghosananda, who were monks and spiritual leaders, gave back to their communities by walking for peace, not only within the community of believers but also as a form of engaged spirituality amid war and conflict.\n\nDuring the past winter, an event similar to the monks’ walk in the US was happening across the Atlantic in the United Kingdom. On January 3, two young men originally from South Sudan, Giel Malual and his childhood friend John Kuei, set off on the “long walk of freedom for Sudan,” with the support of media platform Asylum Speakers.\n\nThe human rights activists’ fundraising and awareness campaign consisted of a roughly 1,126-kilometer (700-mile) walk from the south of England to the far north of Scotland. The organizers said the walk was intended to raise the money needed to build a primary school for Sudanese children displaced by the ongoing conflict in Sudan who are living in refugee camps in neighboring Chad. The response has been so successful that they have so far raised funds for two more schools.\n\nGiel Malual spoke movingly about his motivation to embark on the journey: “The long walk of freedom for Sudan is deeply personal to me which is why choosing this time of year is important, first to put myself in the shoes of Sudanese children and feel a fraction of their day-to-day struggle due to the war and hundreds of miles they had to walk to find safety. It is a walk of souls’ connection.”\n\nMalual and Kuei's walk ended on January 23 after 33 days, raising over GBP 100,000 (approx USD 138,000).\n\nThe walk in Britain was a local initiative that garnered support from community leaders. Among them was the former Lord Mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne, who greeted the walkers and highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, where civil war has forced millions of people to flee and has created a great need for basic services, including education. The walkers and their supporters insist that the walk was not a political demonstration but a sign of solidarity aimed at making the crisis visible. According to them, the Sudan crisis receives little coverage in the international media.\n\nThe Long Walk of Freedom for Sudan is part of a series of peace and solidarity events happening in the United Kingdom. They include silent public walks for peace, which are a tradition of faith communities. In June 2024, faith groups such as Buddhists, Jews, Quakers, Christians, Hindus, Muslims and others united for a silent walk through the heart of London, from Parliament Square to Trafalgar Square, to express their desire for peace in Palestine, and to remember those who have died in wars worldwide. Those attending brought white flowers, and there were no chants or slogans; it was more of an introspective, heartfelt moment rather than a political protest.\n\nThe US Buddhist pilgrimage and the British Sudan solidarity walk are part of a broader trend of people reviving long-distance journeys as a physical way to demonstrate their commitment to peace and humanitarian issues. Experts and practitioners note that peace pilgrimages and long walks have been part of modern history at different times, starting with the United States peace pilgrim movements of the mid-20th century and now including interfaith and human rights projects. In every case, the simple human act of walking, which is persistent, visible, and slow, serves as a means for participants to draw the public’s attention, encouraging them to think while adhering to the practice of nonviolence in daily life.\n\nAs winter gets colder, the monks keep moving forward and are expected to arrive in Washington, D.C., in mid-February after traveling a few thousand miles with the main message of sharing unity and inner peace. In the UK, the long march to the north for Sudanese solidarity was successful in gradually expanding awareness of the children displaced by the war, as the marchers raised funds to give their practical help.\n\nEach walk is an example of how the very act of movement, the basic action of stepping one foot after another, can be a deeply symbolic and practical way to express peace, compassion, and our collective humanity.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In 2025, two groups used long-distance walking in the US and the UK to promote peace and support humanitarian causes. These walks are quiet, slow, and meant to show care and raise awareness without protest slogans or chants.\n\n**What happened** – In the US, 19 Buddhist monks started a four-month, 3,700-kilometer pilgrimage from Texas to Washington, D.C., aiming to ask the government to recognize Vesak, a Buddhist holiday. They walk mostly barefoot and stop in towns to share teachings on peace and mindfulness. Meanwhile, in the UK, two men from South Sudan walked 1,126 kilometers from southern England to northern Scotland to raise money for schools for Sudanese children displaced by war. Their walk raised over 100,000 British pounds.\n\n**Impact** – Both walks attracted wide attention and support. The monks’ journey showed resilience even after one was seriously injured in an accident, while the UK walk helped provide education for children affected by conflict. These walks bring communities together, raise awareness about important issues, and use the simple act of walking to express care and hope.\n\n**What's next step** – The US monks are expected to reach Washington, D.C. by mid-February 2026 to deliver their message. The UK organizers plan to continue supporting schools for displaced children. These efforts may inspire more peaceful and helpful actions through walking in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Two peaceful long walks in the US and UK use slow movement to inspire awareness, healing, and support for people in need.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – En 2025, deux groupes ont utilisé la marche longue distance aux États-Unis et au Royaume-Uni pour promouvoir la paix et soutenir des causes humanitaires. Ces marches sont calmes, lentes, et destinées à montrer de la bienveillance et sensibiliser sans slogans ni cris.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Aux États-Unis, 19 moines bouddhistes ont commencé un pèlerinage de quatre mois, parcourant 3 700 kilomètres du Texas à Washington, D.C., pour demander la reconnaissance officielle de Vesak, une fête bouddhiste. Ils marchent souvent pieds nus et s’arrêtent dans les villes pour partager des enseignements sur la paix et la pleine conscience. Au Royaume-Uni, deux hommes originaires du Soudan du Sud ont marché 1 126 kilomètres du sud de l’Angleterre au nord de l’Écosse pour collecter des fonds en faveur d’écoles pour enfants soudanais déplacés par la guerre. Leur marche a permis de récolter plus de 100 000 livres sterling.\n\n**Impact** – Les deux marches ont attiré beaucoup d’attention et de soutien. Le voyage des moines a montré de la résilience, même après qu’un d’eux a été gravement blessé dans un accident. La marche britannique a aidé à fournir une éducation aux enfants touchés par le conflit. Ces marches rassemblent les communautés, sensibilisent à des enjeux importants, et utilisent la marche simple pour exprimer soin et espoir.\n\n**Étape suivante** – Les moines américains devraient arriver à Washington, D.C. à la mi-février 2026 pour transmettre leur message. Les organisateurs britanniques prévoient de continuer à soutenir les écoles pour enfants déplacés. Ces actions pourraient inspirer d’autres initiatives pacifiques et solidaires par la marche.\n\n**En une phrase** – Deux marches pacifiques aux États-Unis et au Royaume-Uni utilisent le mouvement lent pour inspirer sensibilisation, guérison et soutien aux personnes dans le besoin.\n",

      "content": "European Commissioner for Trade Maroš Šefčovič has noticed that he is being praised in Europe for rapidly concluding trade agreements on behalf of the EU.\n\nBrussels – In 2025, some journalists described the conclusion of EU free trade agreements with third countries with the term “turbo charge”, that is turbocharger. This was confirmed to the TASR Brussels correspondent by Slovak European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maroš Šefčovič, who contributed significantly to these agreements. This year Šefčovič has his schedule set to the same intense pace.\n\n“Last year several people described those trade negotiations as ‘turbo charge’. That there was a dramatic acceleration of trade negotiations between the Union and other countries,” explained Maroš Šefčovič. Journalists found an appropriate technical reference in the fact that, just as in combustion engines turbochargers ensure an increase in overall performance, Šefčovič also contributed to the success of the trade negotiations.\n\nThe European Commissioner reminded TASR, after the conclusion of what is so far the largest trade agreement ever between the EU and India, that the year 2025 is associated with three major agreements – with four member countries of the Mercosur group, with Indonesia and, finally, last year’s negotiations also successfully resulted in an agreement with India.\n\n“These three agreements basically help cover more than 50 percent of European exports,” he explained. He added that the Union is still waiting for the ratification of the trade agreement with Mexico. The ratification of the agreement, whose modernization both sides agreed on in January last year after ten years of negotiations, should be completed during 2026.\n\nŠefčovič indicated that his program for this year also has every chance of becoming a “turbo charge”. “Negotiations with Asian countries are continuing. There is Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand. Furthermore, our Australian partners have also expressed interest in reopening and speeding up trade negotiations, and we are also making good progress in negotiations with the United Arab Emirates,” he added.\n\nAccording to him, the EC considers the negotiations with the United Arab Emirates to be key also because, if they are successful, the other countries of this region grouped in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia – want to join them. The EU is the second largest trading partner of the GCC countries and in 2023 their mutual trade reached the level of 170 billion euros. A new and strengthened trade and investment partnership between both sides can multiply this turnover.\n\n“This is the working agenda for the coming period, but also a summary of three important agreements for the period since I took up this new mandate,” summed up Šefčovič of his work at the head of EU trade policy, for which he has been responsible since 1 December 2024.
