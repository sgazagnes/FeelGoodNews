      "title": "Rocky planet discovered in outer orbit challenges planet formation theory",
      "summary": "Astronomers have uncovered a distant planetary system that flips a long-standing rule of planet formation on its head. Around the small red dwarf star LHS 1903, scientists expected to find rocky planets close in and gas giants farther out — the same pattern seen in our own Solar System and hundreds of others. And at first, that’s exactly what they saw. But new observations revealed a surprise: the outermost planet appears to be rocky, not gaseous.",
      "content": "An international group of astronomers has identified a faraway planetary system that calls into question one of the most widely accepted ideas about how planets take shape.\n\nIn most planetary systems observed across the Milky Way, scientists see the same basic layout. Small, rocky planets circle close to their star, while large gas giants orbit at greater distances. Our own Solar System fits this pattern. The inner planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are made mostly of rock and metal. Farther out, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are dominated by thick layers of gas.\n\nThis arrangement is explained by a leading theory of planet formation. Young stars emit intense radiation that can strip away gases from nearby developing planets, leaving behind solid, rocky worlds. Farther from the star, cooler temperatures allow planets to hold onto thick atmospheres, leading to the formation of gas giants.\n\nA Rule Breaking System Around LHS 1903\n\nA newly identified system orbiting the star LHS 1903 does not follow that script. The discovery, reported in Science, centers on a small, faint red dwarf star that is cooler and less massive than the Sun.\n\nResearchers led by Prof. Ryan Cloutier of McMaster University and Prof. Thomas Wilson of the University of Warwick combined data from telescopes on Earth and in space to study the system. They initially identified three planets. The innermost world is rocky, followed by two gas rich planets similar to smaller versions of Neptune, a lineup that matches standard expectations.\n\nBut years of additional observations brought an unexpected twist. New measurements from the European Space Agency's CHEOPS satellite revealed a fourth planet, called LHS 1903 e, orbiting farthest from the star. Surprisingly, this outer world appears to be rocky.\n\n\"We've seen this pattern: rocky inside, gaseous outside, across hundreds of planetary systems. But now, the discovery of a rocky planet in the outer part of a system forces us to rethink the timing and conditions under which rocky planets can form,\" says Cloutier, who is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.\n\nRuling Out Collisions and Planetary Shifts\n\nThe team explored several possible explanations. They considered whether a massive impact might have stripped away the planet's atmosphere. They also examined whether the planets could have shifted positions over time. Detailed computer simulations and studies of the planets' orbits ruled out both scenarios.\n\nInstead, the findings point to a more unexpected idea. The planets in this system may not have formed simultaneously. Rather, they could have developed one after another as conditions around the star changed.\n\nInside Out Planet Formation\n\nStandard models propose that planets arise within a protoplanetary disc, a swirling cloud of gas and dust surrounding a young star. In this environment, clumps of material form several planetary embryos at roughly the same time. Over millions of years, these growing bodies evolve into fully formed planets with a range of sizes and compositions.\n\nThe structure of the LHS 1903 system suggests a different pathway known as inside out planet formation. In this scenario, planets take shape sequentially in shifting environments. The local conditions at the time each planet finishes forming determine whether it becomes gas rich or remains rocky.\n\nThis framework could explain the unusual nature of LHS 1903 e. By the time it began to assemble, much of the gas in the surrounding disc may have already dissipated, leaving too little material to build a thick atmosphere.\n\n\"It's remarkable to see a rocky world forming in an environment that shouldn't favour that outcome. It challenges the assumptions built into our current models,\" says Cloutier, who adds that the discovery raises broader questions about whether LHS 1903 is an anomaly or an early example of a pattern scientists have yet to recognize.\n\n\"As telescopes and detection methods become more precise, we are strengthening our ability to find planetary systems that don't resemble our own and that don't conform to longstanding theories,\" he says.\n\n\"Each new system adds another data point to a growing picture of planetary diversity -- one that forces scientists to rethink the processes that shape worlds across the galaxy.\"",

      "summary": "A massive star 2.5 million light-years away simply vanished — and astronomers now know why. Instead of exploding in a supernova, it quietly collapsed into a black hole, shedding its outer layers in a slow-motion cosmic fade-out. The leftover debris continues to glow in infrared light, offering a long-lasting signal of the black hole’s birth. The finding reshapes our understanding of how some of the universe’s biggest stars meet their end.",
      "content": "Astronomers have directly observed a massive dying star skip a supernova explosion and instead collapse into a black hole. This event provides the most detailed set of observations ever assembled of a star making that transition, giving researchers an unusually complete view of how stellar black holes form.\n\nBy combining fresh telescope data with more than a decade of archived observations, scientists were able to test and refine long standing theories about how the most massive stars end their lives. Rather than exploding outward in a brilliant supernova, this star's core gave way under gravity and formed a black hole. In the process, its unstable outer layers were gradually pushed outward.\n\nThe findings, published February 12 in Science, are drawing attention because they offer a rare look at the birth of a black hole. The results may help explain why some massive stars explode dramatically at the end of their lives, while others collapse quietly.\n\n\"This is just the beginning of the story,\" says Kishalay De, an associate research scientist at the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute and lead author on the new study. Light from dusty debris surrounding the newborn black hole, he says, \"is going to be visible for decades at the sensitivity level of telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, because it's going to continue to fade very slowly. And this may end up being a benchmark for understanding how stellar black holes form in the universe.\"\n\nThe Disappearance of M31-2014-DS1 in Andromeda\n\nThe star, known as M31-2014-DS1, was located about 2.5 million light-years away in the Andromeda Galaxy. De and colleagues examined data collected between 2005 and 2023 from NASA's NEOWISE mission along with other ground and space telescopes. They discovered that the star began brightening in infrared light in 2014. Then in 2016, its brightness dropped sharply in less than a year.\n\nBy 2022 and 2023, the star had nearly vanished in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, fading to just one ten-thousandth of its former brightness in those bands. What remains can now only be detected in mid-infrared light, where it glows at roughly one-tenth of its original intensity.\n\nDe says, \"This star used to be one of the most luminous stars in the Andromeda Galaxy, and now it was nowhere to be seen. Imagine if the star Betelgeuse suddenly disappeared. Everybody would lose their minds! The same kind of thing [was] happening with this star in the Andromeda Galaxy.\"\n\nWhen the team compared the observations with theoretical predictions, they concluded that such an extreme drop in brightness strongly indicates that the star's core collapsed and formed a black hole.\n\nWhy Some Massive Stars Fail to Explode\n\nStars shine because nuclear fusion in their cores converts hydrogen into helium, creating outward pressure that counteracts gravity. In stars at least 10 times more massive than our sun, this balance eventually breaks down when nuclear fuel runs low. Gravity then overwhelms the outward pressure, causing the core to collapse and form a dense neutron star.\n\nIn many cases, a flood of neutrinos released during this collapse generates a powerful shock wave that tears the star apart in a supernova. But if that shock wave is too weak to eject the surrounding material, much of the star can fall back inward. Theoretical models have long suggested that this fallback can turn the neutron star into a black hole.\n\n\"We've known for almost 50 years now that black holes exist,\" says De, \"yet we are barely scratching the surface of understanding which stars turn into black holes and how they do it.\"\n\nThe Key Role of Convection\n\nThe detailed study of M31-2014-DS1 also helped researchers revisit a similar object, NGC 6946-BH1, which had been identified a decade earlier. Reanalyzing both cases revealed a crucial missing ingredient in understanding what happens to a star's outer layers after a failed supernova. The answer lies in convection.\n\nConvection arises from large temperature differences inside a star. The core is extremely hot, while the outer layers are much cooler. This contrast drives gas to circulate between hotter and cooler regions.\n\nWhen the core collapses, the outer gas is still in motion because of this churning process. According to models developed at the Flatiron Institute, that motion prevents most of the outer material from plunging straight into the black hole. Instead, some inner layers circle the black hole, while the outermost layers are pushed outward.\n\nAs the expelled material travels away, it cools. At lower temperatures, atoms and molecules combine to form dust. That dust blocks light from the hotter gas closer to the black hole, absorbs energy, and reemits it in infrared wavelengths. The result is a lingering reddish glow that can last for decades after the original star has disappeared.\n\nCo-author and Flatiron Research Fellow Andrea Antoni developed the theoretical framework behind these convection models. Drawing on the new observations, she says, \"the accretion rate -- the rate of material falling in -- is much slower than if the star imploded directly in. This convective material has angular momentum, so it circularizes around the black hole. Instead of taking months or a year to fall in, it's taking decades. And because of all this, it becomes a brighter source than it would be otherwise, and we observe a long delay in the dimming of the original star.\"\n\nMuch like water spiraling down a drain rather than dropping straight through, gas continues orbiting the newly formed black hole as gravity gradually pulls it inward. This delayed infall means the entire star does not collapse all at once. Even after the core quickly gives way, some material falls back slowly over many decades.\n\nResearchers estimate that only about one percent of the star's original outer envelope ultimately feeds the black hole, producing the faint light still observed today.\n\nBuilding a Bigger Picture of Black Hole Formation\n\nAs they analyzed M31-2014-DS1, the team also reexamined NGC 6946-BH1. The new study provides strong evidence that both stars followed a similar path. What first seemed like an unusual case now appears to be part of a broader category of failed supernovae that quietly produce black holes.\n\nM31-2014-DS1 initially stood out as an \"oddball,\" De says, but it now seems to be one of several examples, including NGC 6946-BH1.\n\n\"It's only with these individual jewels of discovery that we start putting together a picture like this,\" De says.",
