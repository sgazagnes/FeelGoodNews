      "content": "Boy with rare condition amazes doctors after world-first gene therapy\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Fergus Walsh Medical editor Share Save\n\nChu family\n\nA three-year-old boy has astounded doctors with his progress after becoming the first person in the world with his devastating disease to receive a ground-breaking gene therapy. Oliver Chu has a rare, inherited condition called Hunter syndrome - or MPSII - which causes progressive damage to the body and brain. In the most severe cases, patients with the disease usually die before the age of 20. The effects are sometimes described as a type of childhood dementia. Due to a faulty gene, before the treatment Oliver was unable to produce an enzyme crucial for keeping cells healthy. In a world first, medical staff in Manchester have tried to halt the disease by altering Oliver's cells using gene therapy. Prof Simon Jones, who is co-leading the trial tells the BBC: \"I've been waiting 20 years to see a boy like Ollie doing as well as he is, and it's just so exciting.\"\n\nAt the centre of this remarkable story is Oliver - the first of five boys around the world to receive the treatment - and the Chu family, from California, who have put their faith in the medical team at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. A year after starting the treatment, Oliver now appears to be developing normally. \"Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it's just so amazing,\" says his mother Jingru. The BBC has followed Oliver's story for more than a year - including how scientists in the UK first developed the pioneering gene therapy and how the medical trial they are conducting almost didn't get off the ground due to lack of funds.\n\nStem cell removal - December 2024\n\nWe first meet Oliver and his dad Ricky in December 2024 at the clinical research facility at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. It's a big day. Since being diagnosed with Hunter syndrome in April, Oliver's life - like that of his elder brother, Skyler, who also has the condition - has been dominated by hospital visits. Skyler had shown some late development in speech and coordination, but this had initially been put down to being born during Covid. Ricky tells me his sons' diagnosis came as a complete shock. \"When you find out about Hunter syndrome, the first thing the doctor tells you is 'Don't go on the internet and look it up because you'll find the worst cases and you'll be very, very disheartened'.\" \"But, like anybody, you look it up and you're like, 'Oh my goodness, is this what's going to happen to both my sons?'\" Children are born apparently healthy, but around the age of two they start to show symptoms of the disease. These vary and can include changes to physical features, stiffness of the limbs and short stature. It can cause damage throughout the body, including to the heart, liver, bones and joints and in the most serious cases can lead to severe mental impairment and progressive neurological decline. Hunter syndrome almost always occurs in boys. It's extremely rare, affecting one in 100,000 male births in the world. Until now, the only medicine available for Hunter syndrome was Elaprase, which costs around £300,000 per patient, per year and can slow the physical effects of the disease. The drug is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and so does not help with cognitive symptoms. But today, Oliver is being hooked up to a machine and having some of his cells removed - the first crucial step in trying to halt his genetic disorder in this one-off treatment. \"His blood is being passed through a fancy machine that is collecting a specific type of cell called stem cells which will be sent to a lab to be modified and then given back to him,\" Dr Claire Horgan, consultant paediatric haematologist explains.\n\nOliver's cells are tweaked\n\nOliver's cells are carefully packaged and sent to a laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London. In Hunter syndrome, a genetic error means that cells are missing the instructions for making an enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), essential for breaking down large sugar molecules which over time accumulate in tissues and organs. Scientists insert the missing IDS gene into a virus, which has its genetic material removed so that it can't cause disease. A similar method has been used in other gene therapies, such as the treatment for another rare inherited condition, MLD. Dr Karen Buckland, from the Cell and Gene Therapy Service at GOSH, explains: \"We use the machinery from the virus to insert a working copy of the faulty gene into each of the stem cells. \"When those go back to Oliver, they should repopulate his bone marrow and start to produce new white blood cells and each of these will hopefully start to produce the missing protein [enzyme] in his body.\" There still remains the issue of how to get enough of the missing enzyme into the brain. To overcome this, the inserted gene is modified so that the enzyme it produces crosses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently.\n\nInfusion day - February 2025\n\nWatch: Moment Oliver becomes the first person in the world to have the infusion to treat Hunter syndrome\n\nWe next meet Oliver back at the clinical research facility at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. This time he's with his mum Jingru, while Ricky has stayed in California to look after Skyler. There is a sense of anticipation as a member of the research team opens a large a metal cryopreservation tank where Oliver's gene edited stem cells are frozen, having been transported back from GOSH. A small, clear infusion bag is removed and slowly brought to body temperature in a tray of liquid. After multiple checks, a nurse draws the clear fluid containing around 125 million gene-modified stem cells, into a syringe. Oliver is used to hospitals, but is fretful, and wriggles as the research nurse slowly injects the treatment, about a cup full, into a catheter in his chest. Jingru holds Oliver steady in her arms. After 10 minutes, the infusion is done. An hour later, a second, identical infusion is made. Oliver continues to watch cartoons on a portable screen, oblivious to the potential importance of what's just happened. And that's it. The gene therapy is complete. It seems to be all over rather quickly, yet the ambition here is huge: to stop Oliver's progressive disease in its tracks, in a one-off treatment. After a couple of days, Oliver and Jingru fly back to California. Now the family, and the medical team must wait to see if the gene therapy has worked.\n\nEarly signs of progress - May 2025\n\nParents Jingru and Ricky hope the ground-breaking therapy will eventually be available for Oliver's older brother Skyler too\n\nIn May, Oliver is back in Manchester for crucial tests to see if the gene therapy is working. This time the whole family is here. We meet in a park in central Manchester and it's immediately clear that things are looking good. Oliver is more mobile and inquisitive than I've seen him. Admittedly, he now has the freedom to play and is out of hospital, but he appears brighter and healthier. Ricky is thrilled: \"He's doing really well. We have seen him progressing in his speech, and mobility. In just three months he has matured.\" The really big news is that Oliver has been able to come off the weekly infusion of the missing enzyme. \"I want to pinch myself every time I tell people that Oliver is making his own enzymes,\" says Jingru. \"Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it's just so amazing.\" She tells me he is \"so different\" from before the treatment, is talking \"a ton\" and is engaging more with other children. It is lovely to finally meet five-year-old Skyler who is very protective and caring towards his younger brother. \"My wish upon the star is for Skyler, to be able to get the same treatment,\" says Ricky. \"It feels like Oliver has got a reset in his life, and I want the same thing for Skyler, even though he's a bit older.\" Initially it was thought that Oliver was too old for the trial, as the treatment cannot reverse existing damage, but tests showed he was still largely unaffected. Skyler seems to take delight in the world around him, and is keen to hold my hand and chat as we walk to the park. Ricky explains that Skyler has delayed development in speech and motor skills, but is undergoing infusion therapy, which gets the treatment to his body, but not his brain.\n\n'Eternally grateful'\n\nWatch: \"It's all we dreamed for,\" says Oliver's dad Ricky\n\nOliver returns to Manchester every three months for a few days of follow-up tests. In late August, further checks confirm the gene therapy is working. Oliver is clearly thriving, and to date is now nine months post treatment. Prof Jones, whom Oliver calls Santa because of his white beard, is beaming: \"Before the transplant Ollie didn't make any enzyme at all and now he's making hundreds of times the normal amount. \"But more importantly, we can see he's improving, he's learning, he's got new words and new skills and he's moving around much more easily.\" However, Prof Jones exercises a degree of caution: \"We need to be careful and not get carried away in the excitement of all this, but things are as good as they could be at this point in time.\" On the rooftop garden at the hospital, Oliver plays with his dad. \"He's like a completely different child. He's running around everywhere, he won't stop talking,\" says Ricky. \"The future for Ollie seems very bright and hopefully this means more kids will get the treatment.\" In all, five boys have been signed up for the trial, from the US, Europe and Australia. None are from the UK as patients here were diagnosed too late to qualify. All the boys will be monitored for at least two years. If the trial is deemed a success, the hospital and university hope to partner with another biotech firm in order to get the treatment licensed. Prof Jones says the same gene therapy approach is being applied to other gene disorders. There are similar treatments on trial in Manchester for MPS type 1 or Hurler syndrome and MPS type 3 or Sanfilippo syndrome. Ricky and Jingru say they are \"eternally grateful\" to the Manchester team for allowing Oliver to join the trial. They say they are astonished by his progress in recent months. Oliver's now producing the missing enzyme and his body and brain are healthy. \"I don't want to jinx it, but I feel like it's gone very, very well,\" says Ricky. \"His life is no longer dominated by needles and hospital visits. His speech, agility and cognitive development have all got dramatically better. \"It's not just a slow, gradual curve as he gets older, it has shot up exponentially since the transplant.\"\n\nThe trial that almost never was\n\nResearchers at the University of Manchester led by Prof Brian Bigger had spent more than 15 years working on creating the gene therapy for Hunter syndrome. In 2020 the university announced a partnership with a small US biotech company Avrobio, to conduct a clinical trial. But three years later the company handed back the licence to the university, following poor results from another gene therapy study and a lack of funds. The first-in-human trial, which would soon help Oliver, was in jeopardy before it had even begun. Prof Jones: \"We had to move very quickly to try to save the whole idea and find another sponsor and another source of funding.\" It was then that British charity, LifeArc, stepped in, providing £2.5m of funding. CEO Dr Sam Barrell said: \"A huge challenge for the more than 3.5 million people in the UK living with rare conditions, is getting access to effective treatments – currently 95% of conditions have none. \" The Chu family are relieved the trial didn't come to a halt and now hope Skyler may one day benefit from the same gene therapy as his brother. \"I would walk to the end of the earth, backwards, forwards, upside down, barefoot, to make sure my kids have a better future,\" says Ricky.",

      "summary": "Researchers have uncovered a surprising way the brain switches pain on, revealing that neurons can release an enzyme outside the cell that activates pain signals without disrupting normal movement or sensation. This enzyme, called VLK, modifies nearby proteins in a way that intensifies pain and strengthens connections tied to learning and memory. Removing VLK in mice dramatically reduced post-surgery pain while leaving normal function untouched, offering a promising path toward safer, more targeted pain treatments.",
      "content": "Researchers at Tulane University, working with teams from eight additional institutions, have identified a previously unknown way that nerve cells send messages. This discovery could change how scientists understand pain and may guide the development of safer and more effective treatments.\n\nThe work was co-led by Matthew Dalva, director of the Tulane Brain Institute and professor of cell and molecular biology in the School of Science and Engineering, together with Ted Price at the University of Texas at Dallas. Their study shows that neurons can release an enzyme outside the cell that activates pain signals following an injury. The findings, reported in Science, also shed new light on how brain cells strengthen their connections during learning and memory.\n\nExternal Enzyme Linked to Pain Activation\n\n\"This finding changes our fundamental understanding of how neurons communicate,\" Dalva said. \"We've discovered that an enzyme released by neurons can modify proteins on the outside of other cells to turn on pain signaling -- without affecting normal movement or sensation.\"\n\nThe researchers identified this enzyme as vertebrate lonesome kinase (VLK). They found that neurons use VLK to communicate in the space surrounding the cells, where it alters nearby proteins in ways that can influence how signals travel between nerve cells.\n\nVLK's Role in Cell Signaling and Drug Development\n\n\"This is one of the first demonstrations that phosphorylation can control how cells interact in the extracellular space,\" Dalva said. \"It opens up an entirely new way of thinking about how to influence cell behavior and potentially a simpler way to design drugs that act from the outside rather than having to penetrate the cell.\"\n\nThe team discovered that active neurons release VLK, which increases the activity of a receptor involved in pain, learning and memory. When researchers removed VLK from pain-sensing neurons in mice, the animals did not experience normal post-surgical pain, yet their movement and sensory abilities remained intact. When VLK levels were increased, pain responses intensified.\n\nImplications for Pain, Learning and Neural Plasticity\n\n\"This study gets to the core of how synaptic plasticity works -- how connections between neurons evolve,\" said Price, director of the Center for Advanced Pain Studies, professor of neuroscience at the University of Texas at Dallas' School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences and a co-corresponding author of the study. \"It has very broad implications for neuroscience, especially in understanding how pain and learning share similar molecular mechanisms.\"\n\nDalva noted that the results point toward a safer strategy for altering pain pathways by focusing on enzymes such as VLK instead of blocking NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors help regulate communication between neurons but can cause significant side effects when disrupted.\n\nPathway May Simplify Future Drug Design\n\nThe findings also offer one of the first examples of how to influence interactions between proteins on the cell surface without entering the cell itself. Dalva said this could make drug development easier and reduce unintended effects, since the therapeutic agent would work outside the cell.\n\nNext steps include determining whether this mechanism affects only a small set of proteins or represents a wider biological process that has gone largely unnoticed. If it proves to be widespread, it may reshape treatment strategies for neurological and other diseases.\n\nLarge Collaborative Effort\n\nThe research was carried out in partnership with colleagues at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the University of Houston, Princeton University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, New York University Grossman School of Medicine and Thomas Jefferson University.\n\n\"Our findings were only possible through this kind of collaboration,\" Dalva said. \"By combining Tulane's expertise in synaptic biology with the strengths of our partners, we were able to reveal a mechanism that has implications not just for pain, but for learning and memory across species.\"\n\nThe project was supported by grants from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Center for Research Resources, all part of the National Institutes of Health. Co-first authors include Dr. Sravya Kolluru, Dr. Praveen Chander and Dr. Kristina Washburn, all members of The Dalva Lab at Tulane.",

The work points toward a natural, cell-based way to slow Alzheimer’s decline.",
      "content": "Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine have identified a natural process in the brain that can remove existing amyloid plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease while also helping preserve memory and thinking ability. This process relies on astrocytes, star shaped support cells, which can be guided to clear out the toxic plaque buildup commonly seen in Alzheimer's. When the team increased the amount of Sox9, a protein that influences many astrocyte functions during aging, the cells became more effective at removing amyloid deposits. The findings, reported in Nature Neuroscience, suggest that strengthening astrocyte activity could one day help slow cognitive decline linked to neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n\"Astrocytes perform diverse tasks that are essential for normal brain function, including facilitating brain communications and memory storage. As the brain ages, astrocytes show profound functional alterations; however, the role these alterations play in aging and neurodegeneration is not yet understood,\" said first author Dr. Dong-Joo Choi, who conducted this work while at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy and the Department of Neurosurgery at Baylor. Choi is now an assistant professor at the Center for Neuroimmunology and Glial Biology, Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.\n\nFocusing on Sox9 as a Key Regulator\n\nFor this project, the investigators set out to understand how astrocytes change with age and how those changes relate to Alzheimer's disease. Their attention centered on Sox9, a protein that influences a wide network of genes involved in astrocyte aging.\n\n\"We manipulated the expression of the Sox9 gene to assess its role in maintaining astrocyte function in the aging brain and in Alzheimer's disease models,\" explained corresponding author Dr. Benjamin Deneen, professor and Dr. Russell J. and Marian K. Blattner Chair in the Department of Neurosurgery, director of the Center for Cancer Neuroscience, member of the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor and principal investigator at the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital.\n\nTesting the Approach in Symptomatic Alzheimer's Models\n\n\"An important point of our experimental design is that we worked with mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that had already developed cognitive impairment, such as memory deficits, and had amyloid plaques in the brain,\" Choi said. \"We believe these models are more relevant to what we see in many patients with Alzheimer's disease symptoms than other models in which these types of experiments are conducted before the plaques form.\"\n\nIn these models, the researchers either increased or removed Sox9 and then monitored each mouse's cognitive performance for six months. During this period, the animals were tested on their ability to recognize familiar objects and locations. After the behavioral studies were completed, the team examined the brains to measure plaque accumulation.\n\nHigher Sox9 Levels Improve Plaque Removal and Memory\n\nThe results showed a clear difference. Lowering Sox9 led to faster plaque buildup, reduced structural complexity in astrocytes and diminished plaque clearing. Raising Sox9 had the opposite effect, increasing the cells' activity, supporting plaque removal and preserving cognitive performance. The protective benefits suggested that strong astrocyte engagement may help slow the cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative disease.\n\n\"We found that increasing Sox9 expression triggered astrocytes to ingest more amyloid plaques, clearing them from the brain like a vacuum cleaner,\" Deneen said. \"Most current treatments focus on neurons or try to prevent the formation of amyloid plaques.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Alzheimer’s disease causes harmful clumps called amyloid plaques to build up in the brain. These plaques are linked to memory loss and thinking problems. Scientists want to find ways to remove these plaques and protect brain function.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine discovered that increasing a protein called Sox9 in special brain cells named astrocytes helps these cells clear out amyloid plaques. They tested this in mice that already had memory problems and plaques. When Sox9 levels were raised, the astrocytes removed more plaques, and the mice’s memory improved over six months.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it shows a natural way the brain can clean itself by activating astrocytes, not just by targeting nerve cells or stopping plaques from forming. The study suggests that boosting Sox9 could slow down memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n**What’s next step** – Scientists want to study Sox9’s role in human brains and explore treatments that increase this protein to help patients. More research is needed to understand how to safely use this approach in people.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Raising the protein Sox9 helps brain support cells clear harmful plaques and improve memory in Alzheimer’s models, pointing to new treatment possibilities.",

Les chercheurs cherchent des moyens de supprimer ces plaques et de protéger les fonctions cérébrales.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs du Baylor College of Medicine ont découvert qu’augmenter une protéine appelée Sox9 dans des cellules cérébrales spéciales nommées astrocytes aide ces cellules à éliminer les plaques amyloïdes. Ils ont testé cela sur des souris déjà atteintes de troubles de la mémoire et de plaques. En augmentant Sox9, les astrocytes ont retiré plus de plaques, et la mémoire des souris s’est améliorée sur six mois.\n\n**Impact** – Cela est important car cela montre une manière naturelle dont le cerveau peut s’auto-nettoyer en activant les astrocytes, plutôt que de cibler seulement les neurones ou d’empêcher la formation des plaques. L’étude suggère qu’augmenter Sox9 pourrait ralentir la perte de mémoire liée à Alzheimer.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques souhaitent étudier le rôle de Sox9 dans le cerveau humain et développer des traitements pour augmenter cette protéine afin d’aider les patients. Plus de recherches sont nécessaires pour utiliser cette méthode en toute sécurité.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – Augmenter la protéine Sox9 aide les cellules de soutien cérébrales à éliminer les plaques nuisibles et à améliorer la mémoire dans des modèles d’Alzheimer, ouvrant de nouvelles pistes thérapeutiques.",

      "title": "Malaria vaccine price cut set to protect 7 million more children by 2030",
      "summary": "Vaccine alliance Gavi and children’s agency UNICEF have struck a new pricing deal that will sharply cut the cost of a key malaria vaccine and make it possible to protect nearly seven million additional children by 2030, the agencies announced on Sunday.",
      "content": "Under the agreement, the price of the R21/Matrix-M vaccine will fall to $2.99 per dose within a year – a reduction expected to save up to $90 million. Those savings should allow countries to secure more than 30 million extra doses over the next five years.\n\n“Today’s announcement is a powerful example of what our Vaccine Alliance does best,” said An Vermeersch, Gavi’s Chief Vaccine Programmes & Markets Officer.\n\n“We are leveraging innovative financing and partnerships to secure affordable vaccines that can better protect children against one of Africa’s biggest killers.”\n\nNearly 600,000 deaths in 2023\n\nMalaria remains one of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases. In 2023, it caused an estimated 597,000 deaths, the vast majority among young children in Africa. A child dies from the disease roughly every minute.\n\n“A devastating death toll like this demands action,” said Leila Pakkala, Director of UNICEF’s Supply Division.\n\n“At a time of declining international aid, UNICEF is determined to work with partners to deliver enough vaccines at the best possible price to protect children.”\n\nThe new pricing arrangement was enabled by an advance payment through the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), which converts long-term donor pledges into upfront funds. This gives Gavi the ability to act quickly when major market-shaping opportunities emerge.\n\nAmbition to action\n\n“IFFIm exists to turn ambition into action,” said Ken Lay, Chair of the IFFIm Board. “This agreement shows how financial innovation can unlock opportunities that save lives.”\n\nMore than 40 million malaria vaccine doses have already been delivered through Gavi-supported programmes, with 24 African countries now integrating malaria vaccination into routine immunisation.\n\nDemand is strong: 14 countries introduced the vaccine for the first time last year, and another seven have done so in 2025.\n\nThe lower price is expected to help Gavi move closer to its target of fully vaccinating 50 million additional children against malaria by the end of the decade.\n\nBoth WHO-recommended malaria vaccines, R21/Matrix-M and RTS,S, have been shown to reduce malaria cases by more than half in the first year after vaccination, with further protection following a booster dose.\n\nFor families and health systems already under strain from the disease, the expanded rollout could be transformative. “This is about giving every child a fair chance at protection,” Lay said. “It’s about saving lives now, not years from now.”",
