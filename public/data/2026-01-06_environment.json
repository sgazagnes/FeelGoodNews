      "summary": "Earth911 turns 35 in 2026. We invited Trey Granger, who worked at Earth911 from 2007...\nThe post 35 Years Worth Of Things You (Probably) Didn’t Know About Earth911 appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "Earth911 turns 35 in 2026. We invited Trey Granger, who worked at Earth911 from 2007 to 2014 as the site’s first content editor, and whoe also oversaw expansion of the recycling directory, to share some of the highlights of the continuing journey to an easy to understand recycling system.\n\nEarth911 turns 35 years old in 2026 (but we don’t look a day over 30). To celebrate, here are 35 fun facts about your favorite low-waste resource.\n\n1. At 35 years old, Earth911 predates several well-established recycling brands, including America Recycles Day (founded in 1997), Call2Recycle (1994), the Product Stewardship Institute (2000), the Recycle Guys (1992), and the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (2004).\n\n2. Initially launched on October 29, 1991, the recycling directory originally featured only one material: motor oil. It also only listed recycling locations in Arizona.\n\n3. The World Wide Web was still in its infancy in 1991, so the original search platform was the toll-free 1-800-CLEANUP.\n\n4. Before 1-800-CLEANUP, states and municipalities were maintaining their own localized recycling directories. In California alone, there were 248 different environmental hotlines to provide recycling information across a range of materials.\n\n5. 1-800-CLEANUP had some early celebrity endorsements. In the 1990s, Mario Andretti, Ted Danson, and Steven Seagal (among others) recorded public service announcements for the company on the importance of motor oil recycling.\n\n6. The Earth911 website first launched in 1996, via the domain name cleanup.org. By then, the directory contained nationwide recycling information for over 100 materials.\n\n7. The name Earth911 came about thanks to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which referred to the recycling directory as “Earth’s 911,” a call-to-action regarding the urgency to reduce America’s waste. The name stuck, and the EPA also helped support the nationwide expansion of the recycling directory via a grant.\n\n8. While today we may take for granted the technology of GPS and turn-by-turn directions, Earth911 was ahead of the curve in its early days. Using ArcView software, all recycling center addresses were geocoded in the directory so consumers could enter their ZIP code and find nearby recycling locations.\n\n9. Earth911 has always relied on partnerships with thousands of local government recycling officials, who are granted remote access to update their curbside and drop-off recycling information in the directory.\n\n10. As one of the earliest web-based directories, Earth911 has always enjoyed strong search engine optimization. For years, it was the #1 search result on Google for terms like “recycle” and “prevent global warming,” outranking popular resources like the EPA and Wikipedia.\n\n11. Earth911 had an outside-the-box approach to advertise its free recycling directory. It partnered with consumer product companies including ExxonMobil and Yellowbook to provide a recycling call-to-action on packaging so customers would know where to recycle their products.\n\n12. The directory wasn’t always just a resource for recycling information. In its early tenure, it featured electric vehicle charging stations and marine bilge pump out locations.\n\n13. Earth911 Founder Chris Warner was also an animal lover. In 1999, he utilized Earth911’s location-based technology to launch Pets911, a resource for lost and found pets and local shelter adoptions.\n\n14. In 2002, Earth911 partnered with Oceana to launch Beaches911, which provided real-time water quality information for local beaches. With the tagline “Know Before You Go,” Beaches911 let city and county governments inform beachgoers via the Internet whether their local beach was open on a given day.\n\n15. In 2004, Warner started Amber Alert 911, a web portal for Arizona and seven other states to post missing child alerts that would be distributed locally in real-time. Remember Earth911 the next time you see an Amber Alert notification on your phone or a highway sign.\n\n16. While winning over 70 awards over the years, Earth911’s most prestigious prize is likely the 2001 Stockholm Challenge Award. Unofficially known as the Nobel Prize for the IT society, it celebrates innovative IT programs.\n\n17. Earth911’s original tagline was “Make Every Day Earth Day” to remind Americans that eco-friendliness doesn’t take a day off.\n\n18. Earth911 had a mascot in its early days named Handy. It was a yellow hand with the Earth in its palm that showed kids how to lend a hand to help out the environment.\n\n19. The 2006 Academy Award-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth brought mainstream attention to eco-friendly living. As a result, Earth911’s new owners launched daily lifestyle content on Earth911.com and a weekly newsletter that helped the site reach a whole new audience.\n\n20. Earth911 began syndicating both its recycling directory and articles in 2007 to platforms including Comedy Central, G4 TV, and Live Science. This also allowed companies like Castrol and Keurig to provide local recycling information directly from their websites.\n\n21. Recognizing the impact of business waste, Earth911 launched a business-centric website in 2007 in partnership with Staples. In addition to providing a directory of locations that accept industrial waste, the site provided content such as how to start an office recycling program.\n\n22. In 2007, Earth911 experienced “the Oprah effect.” On her Earth Day special, Oprah Winfrey mentioned Earth911 by name as a resource for recycling, and her plug sent so much traffic to the website that it temporarily crashed the servers.\n\n23. Earth911 made its primetime TV debut in November 2007. As part of its inaugural Green Week, NBC displayed a graphic on-screen during the TV show Heroes telling people to visit Earth911 to recycle their electronics. Luckily, this time the company was prepared for the bump in traffic and no servers crashed.\n\n24. Earth911 went international in 2008, adding recycling locations in Canada and Mexico to the recycling directory.\n\n25. 2008 also saw the relaunch of 1-800-CLEANUP, now bilingual in English and Spanish.\n\n26. Earth911 launched its mobile application iRecycle in 2009, which has since been downloaded over 400,000 times for Android and iOS.\n\n27. By the late 2000s, over 200,000 websites linked to Earth911.com as a resource for local recycling.\n\n28. The popular recycling mystery series debuted on Earth911.com in 2009, answering the question of how to recycle complicated materials that typically aren’t accepted at the curb like pizza boxes and gift cards.\n\n29. Earth911 released its first annual report in 2010, summarizing website traffic from the previous year. The most commonly searched material for recycling in 2009 was computers.\n\n30. In 2011, Earth911 joined The Sustainability Coalition to provide data to consumer product companies and retailers on what products are commonly recycled by curbside programs in the U.S.\n\n31. The Federal Trade Commission revised its Green Guides in 2012, imposing penalties on companies that made claims like “Please recycle” on their packaging without being able to prove that local recycling was actually available. Luckily, Earth911 was able to pair its local recycling data with population data from the US census to provide companies with a numerical value for the percentage of Americans that could recycle over 300 different materials at the curb or via drop-off locations, a handy resource for backing up green claims.\n\n32. In 2014, Earth911 merged with Quest Resource Management Group. Quest provides business recycling and waste management services, including automotive and grocery retailers across the U.S.\n\n33. In 2018, Earth911 was sold to Earth Media Partners, led by Mitch Ratcliffe, and joined the podcast world with Sustainability in Your Ear, a weekly show answering recycling questions and featuring interviews with leaders in the green space.\n\n34. The Earth911 Sustainability Awards debuted in 2019, recognizing outstanding community recycling programs, eco-friendly companies, and green nonprofits.\n\n35. In 2023, Earth911 started the eWaste for Trees program with DonorConnection. Every device recycled via mail through the program would result in the planting of 20 new trees.\n\nHere’s to 35 more years of Earth911 being the go-to resource for low-waste living.\n\nEditor’s Note: The sustainability road has always been a rough one, as is the case with building a new approach to any human problem. We’re preparing a new search experience, with new services that address the entire circular economy needed to keep materials in use and out of landfills. Stay tuned for the next generation of our work.",

Discover the intense world of elite wildland firefighting with Kelly Ramsey, the first woman in about a decade to join the Rowdy River Hotshots, a pseudonymously named, California-based crew of highly trained wildland firefighters. In this episode of Earth911’s Sustainability In Your Ear, Kelly shares insights from her powerful new memoir, Wildfire Days: A Woman, a Hotshot Crew, and the Burning American West, which chronicles her transformative two years fighting fires and discovering herself in the process. Her journey into the masculine world of hotshot crews offers a unique perspective on who becomes one of these ultimate first responders, exploring not just the Marine-type training and intense physicality required, but also the personal transformation that comes from confronting both literal and metaphorical fires.\n\nAs we head into 2025, the conversation takes on urgent relevance, with budget cuts reducing the number of available firefighters despite wildfires growing more severe by the decade. 1,600 firefighters have been laid off this year, despite a growing need. Kelly explains the concept of Preparedness Level 5, when there are no crews left at the time fire danger peaks, and warns that understaffing could leave the nation operating at this dangerous level for much of the upcoming fire season. She also addresses the psychological and physical toll of this extreme profession, the sobering reality of firefighter mortality. She also offers practical advice for those living in wildfire-prone areas on home hardening and evacuation preparedness.

      "title": "The biggest climate migration problem may be that there’s not enough of it",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "This story is excerpted from Shelter From the Storm: How Climate Change Is Creating a New Era of Migration, available January 6, 2026, from The New Press.\n\nIn Guatemala, outside the town of Jocotán, in a house hidden from the main road by a thin wall of vegetation, I met Elena, a slight 38-year-old with bright eyes and dark hair that was just starting to show the first hints of gray. Elena had seven kids whom she spent most of her time caring for, while her husband found unsteady work as a for-hire farmer. Her husband’s job paid enough to get by, just barely, but the family struggled to travel to see a doctor for their 5-year-old daughter, who had an undiagnosed heart issue. The eldest daughter, who was 19, had been going to school but dropped out during the COVID-19 pandemic because they could no longer afford the $40 per month for books, her uniform, and other costs. Meanwhile everything was getting more expensive, Elena complained, and it often did not rain enough to yield a fruitful harvest.\n\nWe met in a neighbor’s dirt-floor compound, where chickens and ducks pecked at a trash heap and muddy patches of ground. Behind me, tortillas smoked on the stove in the detached cinder-block kitchen. Nearby, cars and trucks rumbled down the main road heading to the Honduras border a half hour away.\n\nWhen I asked Elena about the prospect of going to the United States, a shy smile crept across her face. Her husband talks about it, she said, but she knows it’s just a dream. It would cost thousands of dollars to hire a coyote and make the trip, and the only way they could raise that kind of cash would be to put up their land as collateral. Some of her neighbors have made that bet, and sometimes it has worked out, but not always. Migration would be a huge risk. It could take weeks or months for Elena’s husband to travel and establish himself in the United States, assuming he could even get in, during which time Elena would have no source of income. If things didn’t work out and her husband was deported or couldn’t pay off the coyote’s fee plus interest — or worse, if he was injured or killed en route — their land could be swiped from under them, leaving them even worse off than they already were. She would go in a heartbeat, she said, if only it were realistic. And it wasn’t.\n\nAuthor Julian Hattem, editor of the Migration Policy Institute’s online journal. Amanda Joy Photographics\n\nWe might say that Elena is trapped. Emigrating to the United States would almost surely be transformational for her and her family, even if just one member could establish a foothold there. She would no longer need to worry about going hungry. It could put her family on a path of upward mobility, with better access to health care and education. Elena’s children would probably have a markedly more comfortable life than her own, which is the desire of all parents worldwide. This was exactly the story of hundreds of millions of Americans whose ancestors scraped together their savings to come to the United States, where they suffered abuse and worked hard, benefited from and contributed to its economic growth, and in a few generations had descendants with a profoundly different quality of life. Instead, she and her family are stuck in a rural farming community where the land is drying up and falling apart and where the prices at the market are climbing ever higher.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nIn the long run, “trapped populations” may be the worst victims of climate change. Migration costs money and can be complicated and, if traveling internationally, usually illegal. Leaving might enable people like Elena to find better paying jobs elsewhere and send back money that could help protect their homes and families against encroaching climate change.\n\nA barbed wire fence overlooks the Rio Grande at the U.S.-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas. Migrant crossings have dropped significantly in the past year, peaking in the last months of 2023.\n\nJohn Moore / Getty Images\n\nYet for a million reasons people stay in place, even if doing so is dangerous. Many of them cannot leave. When disaster strikes, people with disabilities, the elderly, and the poor tend to be less likely to be able to evacuate, and therefore account for an outsize number of fatalities. When Hurricane Katrina hit the United States, for instance, about half the dead were 75 years and older. Moreover, there is probably no way that Elena could get to the United States legally, and laws can be difficult things to break, especially when they are backed by the full weight and force of the U.S. government. It also often takes connections to be able to move, which many people do not have. If Elena had a cousin or friend in the United States who would help her out — tell her whom to call, where to stay, how to get a job — her family might have an easier time. Without this social capital, she’s facing an uphill climb.\n\nAnd of course, it is about 1,000 miles to get from Guatemala to the United States, and even farther for people from Asia or the Pacific Islands. Deserts and oceans are physically difficult to cross, and often deadly. It is a sad fact that many tens of thousands of people migrating for a better life never live to see it. The United Nations has recorded the cases of more than 72,000 migrants who died or disappeared in their journeys from 2014 to 2025, but this is surely a tremendous undercount, given the remote deserts, forbidding jungles, and expanse of oceans that migrants must cross when they have no legal path. There is no telling how many people die every year trying to seek out a better life.\n\nThe security-first dogma of Western border policies makes these journeys even deadlier than they would be otherwise. As authorities clamp down, migrants are forced to take even more precarious routes to evade detection, putting themselves at increasing risk of dehydration, assault by criminal groups, and shipwreck. The Mediterranean, by far the deadliest migration corridor worldwide, became even deadlier as Italian and EU officials cracked down on lifesaving search-and-rescue operations in the mid-2010s. On the U.S.-Mexico border, the world’s deadliest land crossing, aggressive security policies have historically not necessarily stopped people from crossing, but they have pushed migrants into more dangerous routes deeper into the desert. As the world gets warmer, remote stretches of the desert become deadlier, increasing the risk of dehydration, heat stroke, and exposure.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nIf she could migrate away from the Dry Corridor, the data suggest that Elena would be financially better off. Migration, by and large, tends to be good for people. Although the actual act of migrating is difficult and expensive, the economic payoff is great. Worldwide, migration has lifted millions of people out of poverty — probably billions. According to the World Bank, migrants going from a lower-income country to a higher-income country typically see their wages grow between three and six times.\n\nA view of traffic at the civic center of Guatemala City in August 2025.

The money that migrants send back to friends and loved ones in their origin communities can help build new protections against disaster or make it easier to rebuild afterward. As we drove across Guatemala, a future in which more people left home didn’t actually seem all that bad. The U.S. media tends to portray all of Central America as distressingly poor, with tin roofs, unreliable electricity, and barely-there dirt roads. It is anything but.\n\nEven far from Guatemala City, our car glided on smooth asphalt past gleaming strip malls that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a suburban Phoenix subdivision. Throughout Guatemala, grand two- and three-story houses tower over the road, peeking above the trees and looking oddly out of place behind rough-hewn wood shacks selling pineapples and tortillas. My hotel in Chiquimula featured two separate swimming pools, the water shimmering in the midday sun, perched in a lush sprawling yard where teenagers played soccer and flirted while parents lounged under the pergola. Nearby, an entrepreneur offered tourists paragliding adventures and the chance to go sightseeing in a helicopter. My driver, Conrado, showed me TikTok videos of thrill-seekers screaming with joy in a giant swing at a similar adventure attraction not far away.\n\nMuch of the money used to invest in this growth comes from one place: “Remesas,” Conrado said simply. Remittances. Money from the United States that migrants send back via Western Union, a mobile phone app, or a range of other services. About 3 in 10 households in northern Central America receive remittances from abroad, typically about $350 per month in Guatemala. That’s only about 5 percent of median U.S. household income but can be a life-changing amount of money in Guatemala that can easily cover expenses or provide a significant down payment on climate protections. In Guatemala, more money comes from remittances than from all foreign exports combined.\n\nOn a hillside in the tiny village of Barbasco, where drought has ravaged farmlands and extreme weather has accelerated erosion, I met a 40-year-old woman with kind eyes named Consuela, who received money from her son in New York. Intense and recurrent hurricanes had split the earth underneath her home, creating a 6-inch gash in the dirt floor where one end of the building was beginning a slow march toward the edge of the cliff. Inch by inch and bit by bit, the ground underneath had started to give way and slide downhill. It was a common sight on these hills, where coffee and corn plants perched precariously on steep slopes that threatened to give way with the next storm.\n\nConsuela’s home in Barbasco, Guatemala.

Elsewhere, in Ghana, remittances help farmers invest in irrigation systems and crop rotation. They also help recipients build houses out of concrete rather than mud, so families can withstand landslides and other disasters, and provide access to electricity and telephones that alert them to upcoming disasters and enable them to get help when they need it. In hot, coastal Mexico, remittances help residents — particularly poorer residents — purchase air conditioners to stay cool even in the sweltering summer months. In Bangladesh, some recipients say remittances make up half their household income.\n\nIn large part because of these remittances, migration has long been one of the most effective strategies for lifting people out of poverty — not just migrants themselves, but also their families and communities in their homeland.\n\nAs the world reckons with climate change that will particularly hurt poor, rural communities in places like Guatemala, migration is not simply a way to escape impending climate disaster but also a strategy to defend against it. Making it easier for people to leave their home can not only help them flee the most dire disasters but also help them earn money to invest in adaptation and resilience strategies. In fact, some economists say governments should actively spend money to encourage people to migrate, at least to urban areas within their own countries, to boost growth. Subsidizing transportation to cities and helping people find jobs or enroll in new training would mitigate the negative impacts of climate change in rural areas, the thinking goes, and help increase the productivity of cities. The biggest climate migration problem may be that there’s simply not enough of it.\n\nFrom Shelter From the Storm: How Climate Change Is Creating a New Era of Migration by Julian Hattem, to be published on January 6, 2026, by The New Press.",

      "personality_title": "How Migration and Remittances Help Families Adapt to Climate Change",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In places like rural Guatemala, many families face worsening droughts and rising costs that make farming and daily life harder. Climate change is making these challenges worse, and many people dream of moving to better places, like the United States, but face serious obstacles.\n\n**What happened** – Elena, a mother of seven near Jocotán, Guatemala, wants to migrate to the U.S. to improve her family’s life but cannot afford the risky and expensive journey. Migration is often seen as a way to escape poverty and climate problems, but many people like Elena are trapped because they lack money, legal options, or support networks. Despite this, families who do manage to migrate often send money back home, called remittances, which help communities invest in homes, education, and protection from climate disasters.\n\n**Impact** – Migration and remittances have proven to be powerful tools for lifting families out of poverty and helping them adapt to climate change. For example, in Guatemala, about 30% of households receive remittances that can cover essential expenses or help build stronger houses. This money supports families like Consuela’s, who is rebuilding her home away from a dangerous hillside. Migration not only helps individuals but also strengthens entire communities by providing resources to prepare for and recover from climate effects.\n\n**What's next step** – Experts suggest that governments could support safer and easier migration, especially within countries, by helping people move to cities and find jobs or training. This would not only protect vulnerable rural populations but also help urban areas grow and adapt. Encouraging migration as a planned strategy could reduce risks and improve lives amid climate change.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Migration and the money sent home by migrants are vital ways families adapt to climate change, offering both immediate relief and long-term resilience for vulnerable communities.\n",
      "personality_title_fr": "Comment la migration et les envois de fonds aident les familles à s’adapter au changement climatique",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Dans des régions rurales comme le Guatemala, de nombreuses familles font face à des sécheresses de plus en plus graves et à la hausse des prix, ce qui rend l’agriculture et la vie quotidienne plus difficiles. Le changement climatique aggrave ces problèmes, et beaucoup rêvent de partir dans des pays comme les États-Unis, mais rencontrent de sérieux obstacles.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Elena, mère de sept enfants près de Jocotán, au Guatemala, souhaite migrer aux États-Unis pour améliorer la vie de sa famille, mais ne peut pas payer ce voyage risqué et coûteux. La migration est souvent vue comme un moyen d’échapper à la pauvreté et aux problèmes climatiques, mais beaucoup, comme Elena, sont piégés faute d’argent, de solutions légales ou de réseaux d’aide. Pourtant, les familles qui réussissent à migrer envoient souvent de l’argent à leur pays, appelé « envois de fonds », qui aide les communautés à investir dans les logements, l’éducation et la protection contre les catastrophes climatiques.\n\n**Impact** – La migration et les envois de fonds sont des outils puissants pour sortir les familles de la pauvreté et les aider à s’adapter au changement climatique. Par exemple, au Guatemala, environ 30 % des foyers reçoivent ces envois qui couvrent des dépenses essentielles ou permettent de construire des maisons plus solides. Cet argent soutient des familles comme celle de Consuela, qui reconstruit sa maison loin d’une colline dangereuse. La migration aide non seulement les individus, mais aussi les communautés entières en fournissant des ressources pour se préparer et se remettre des effets climatiques.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Des experts suggèrent que les gouvernements pourraient soutenir une migration plus sûre et plus facile, surtout à l’intérieur des pays, en aidant les gens à déménager en ville et à trouver un emploi ou une formation. Cela protégerait les populations rurales vulnérables et aiderait aussi les villes à grandir et à s’adapter. Encourager la migration comme stratégie planifiée pourrait réduire les risques et améliorer la vie face au changement climatique.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – La migration et l’argent envoyé par les migrants sont des moyens essentiels pour les familles de s’adapter au changement climatique, offrant à la fois un soulagement immédiat et une résilience à long terme.\n",
      "personality_title_es": "Cómo la migración y las remesas ayudan a las familias a adaptarse al cambio climático",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – En lugares rurales como Guatemala, muchas familias enfrentan sequías cada vez más fuertes y costos que suben, lo que hace que la agricultura y la vida diaria sean más difíciles. El cambio climático empeora estos problemas, y muchas personas sueñan con mudarse a lugares mejores, como Estados Unidos, pero enfrentan obstáculos serios.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Elena, madre de siete hijos cerca de Jocotán, Guatemala, quiere migrar a Estados Unidos para mejorar la vida de su familia, pero no puede pagar el viaje riesgoso y caro. La migración suele verse como una forma de escapar de la pobreza y los problemas climáticos, pero mucha gente como Elena está atrapada porque no tiene dinero, opciones legales o redes de apoyo. Sin embargo, las familias que logran migrar suelen enviar dinero a sus hogares, llamadas remesas, que ayudan a las comunidades a invertir en casas, educación y protección contra desastres climáticos.\n\n**Impacto** – La migración y las remesas han demostrado ser herramientas poderosas para sacar a las familias de la pobreza y ayudarlas a adaptarse al cambio climático. Por ejemplo, en Guatemala, alrededor del 30 % de los hogares reciben remesas que pueden cubrir gastos esenciales o ayudar a construir casas más fuertes. Este dinero apoya a familias como la de Consuela, que está reconstruyendo su hogar lejos de una ladera peligrosa. La migración no solo ayuda a las personas, sino que también fortalece a las comunidades al proporcionar recursos para prepararse y recuperarse de los efectos climáticos.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los expertos sugieren que los gobiernos podrían apoyar una migración más segura y fácil, especialmente dentro de los países, ayudando a las personas a mudarse a las ciudades y encontrar trabajos o capacitación. Esto protegería a las poblaciones rurales vulnerables y también ayudaría a las ciudades a crecer y adaptarse. Fomentar la migración como una estrategia planificada podría reducir riesgos y mejorar vidas frente al cambio climático.\n\n**Una frase clave** – La migración y el dinero que envían los migrantes son formas vitales para que las familias se adapten al cambio climático, ofreciendo alivio inmediato y resiliencia a largo plazo.\n",
