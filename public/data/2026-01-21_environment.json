      "content": "UK homes to get £15bn for solar and green tech to cut energy bills\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Esme Stallard , Climate and science reporter and Justin Rowlatt , Climate Editor Share Save\n\nAndrew Aitchison/Getty Images\n\nHouseholds will be eligible for thousands of pounds' worth of solar panels and other green tech to lower their energy bills, the government has announced. The long-awaited Warm Homes Plan promises to provide £15bn to households across the UK over the next five years, as well as introducing new rights for renters. The government has said it wants to create a \"rooftop revolution\", tripling the number of homes with solar, and lifting one million people out of fuel poverty. The plan has been strongly welcomed by the energy and finance industry, but the Conservative Party said the scheme will \"saddle households with high ongoing running costs\".\n\nFirst touted back in 2024, the Warm Homes Plan promised to tackle the \"national emergency\" of rising energy bills, but it has taken two years for the final detail to be published. The government announced that the plan, published on Wednesday, will focus on funding solar panels, heat pumps and batteries for households across the UK via low-interest loans and grants. For able-to-pay households even with the grants there are likely to be additional costs of installing the technologies. For a heat pump after the subsidy households pay on average £5,000. But for an average three bedroom semi-detached home, installing these three technologies, could save £500 annually on energy bills, it estimates. Although social charity Nesta, and green energy charity, MCS Foundation, have estimated it could be more than £1000. \"A warm home shouldn't be a privilege, it should be a basic guarantee for every family in Britain,\" said Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Measures in the plan include: Extending the Boiler Upgrade Scheme by a further year to 2029/30, offering £7,500 grants for heat pumps\n\nAdditional £600m for low-income households to receive funding for the full cost of solar panels and batteries taking the total available to £5bn\n\nLow and zero-interest loans for households irrespective of income The plan has been strongly welcomed by the energy industry, workers' unions, and the finance sector, who see the long-term financial commitment by the government as crucial for driving private investment into green technologies. \"£15 billion is a substantial commitment, it provides certainty to investors and businesses in the energy market,\" said Dhara Vyas, chief executive of trade body Energy UK. Camilla Born, CEO of Electrify Britain - a joint campaign group from Octopus and EDF to encourage switching to electric heating - also welcomed the announcement and said it will help cut bills long-term but said \"the bad side is that it is a plan, and we need delivery\". Some of the schemes are already distributing grants, but for new funding the government has yet to decide how or when households will receive the money. It said that \"further engagement with the finance sector\" is needed this year. Richard Tice, Reform deputy leader, strongly criticised the plan and said it was: \"A scandalous waste of up to £15bn of taxpayers' cash primarily buying Chinese made solar panels, batteries and heat pumps, that is bad for British industry.\" Two thirds (68%) of the solar panels imported by the UK came from China in 2024, according to HMRC trade data. The government has said the scheme would contribute to 180,000 new jobs in the clean heating sector - although some of these are likely to be from retraining existing engineers.\n\nInsulation funding downgraded\n\nThe original plan had focused on ramping up installation of insulation in homes which was considered a cost-effective way to reduce heat loss from the UK's leaky housing stock. But ongoing controversy with a government-funded insulation scheme, ECO, involving botch installations, has led to the scheme not being extended. 'Failings at every level' resulted in botched insulation scheme, MPs told Aadil Qureshi, CEO of Heat Geek, which retrains heating engineers to install heat pumps, said it was the right decision and a refocus on green tech was better value for government money. Unlike insulation, he said heat pumps are a technology in its infancy, and needed government support to catalyse the industry. \"[The plan] allows the industry to commit, to double down - it allows investors, manufacturers to say let's keep investing to get to a certain point where it is equal with the hydrocarbon alternative,\" he said. By switching households away from oil heaters and gas boilers to electrical heat pumps, powered by renewable energy, the government hopes it will cut the country's planet warming emissions, of which around 18% come from home heating.\n\nDozens of people have got in contact with Your Voice Your BBC News about their experience installing low-carbon technologies like heat pumps. One retired couple Chris and Penny Harcourt, living in Stowmarket, got a heat pump two years ago and said it was the \"best update we have done in our house for 20 years\". But they said that with current electricity prices it was expensive to run and it was only when they got solar panels did they see the costs fall. You can watch a conversation BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt had with Penny below.\n\nClimate Editor Justin Rowlatt speaks to Penny Harcourt, who wrote into Your Voice Your BBC News about her electric-powered house\n\nHeat pumps can be three to four times more efficient than gas boilers, but higher electricity prices mean that they can end up being the same or more expensive to run. But moving households off gas heating has been a priority for the government. Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, has previously said the UK's dependence on fossil fuels was its \"Achilles heel\" - after significant fluctuations in prices - and clean power was the only way to lower energy bills. Miliband defends clean power goal after energy bills rise But the UK has some of the highest electricity bills in Europe due to upgrades to the network, government taxes and the impact of wholesale prices driven by the gas price. Claire Coutinho, shadow energy secretary said: \"Unless the Government gets serious about cutting electricity bills now, many of these taxpayer-funded schemes will saddle households with high ongoing running costs every single year.\" The government hopes that ramping up solar panels will be the answer. The Warm Homes Plan will encourage households to opt for the trio of low carbon technologies - heat pumps, solar panels and batteries. This will see more of the electricity demand of heat pumps met by home-generated solar energy rather than from the grid; thus driving down prices. Miliband told the BBC that the government's plan is the \"the most cost-efficient long-term way to make a difference to people\" and bring energy bills down. \"We saw the highest demand for solar panels last year, the highest demand for heat pumps we've ever seen, but we don't want those to just be the preserve of the wealthy,\" he said.\n\nNot everyone in the green industry is supportive of all the measures. Dale Vince, CEO of energy company Ecotricity, praised the new funding for solar but criticised the high level of subsidy for heat pumps. Although he said they had a role to play, he said they weren't the national answer for lowering heating costs and greenhouse gas emissions. \"Solar panels give us the biggest bang for buck there is no doubt about that - cheapest to install and most productive in terms of bringing down energy bills. Heat pumps sit at the other end of that scale,\" Vince said. \"We could put solar panels on 10 million rooftops or heat pumps in one million homes.\"\n\nRenters' rights reforms\n\nThe installation of low carbon tech will only be available to those who are homeowners or in social housing, but the Warm Homes Plan also includes recent announcements to changes in renters' rights. From 2030, landlords will need to make sure rental properties have a minimum energy efficiency score of EPC C - up from E. But currently the way that a home is awarded an EPC score is based on estimated running costs rather than energy efficiency, which can mean the score is downgraded following a heat pump installation. In the plan, the government has said it intends to announce changes to the assessment process later this year. The industry was also hoping that the Warm Homes Plan would set out updated efficiency requirements for new builds - the Future Homes Standard - but it said these would be published in the next few months. There had been concern amongst environmentalists that the requirement for solar panels on new homes was to be dropped. But the plan said: \"We have confirmed that under these standards, new homes will have low-carbon heating, high levels of energy efficiency and solar panels by default.\" Jess Ralston, Energy Analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said that these decisions have been a long time coming. \"That timelines are being pushed back is likely to be frustrating for those who are still colder and poorer in shoddy rental homes, but the public overwhelmingly back better standards for new builds so should be encouraged to see new requirements on the house builders at long last,\" she said.\n\nAdditional reporting Miho Tanaka",

      "summary": "",
      "content": "This story was produced by Grist and was co-published with The Asian Dispatch . It is part of the Grist series Vital Signs , exploring the ways climate change affects your health. This reporting initiative is made possible thanks to support from the Wellcome Trust.\n\nIt is a cloudy, humid September morning near the end of monsoon season in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh and one of the world’s most densely populated cities. Streets normally bustling are quiet as residents of the Uttara neighborhood prepare for the weekly prayer. Suddenly, dozens of young volunteers emerge from the silence, gathering before heading to the shores of a small nearby lake. There, the stench of rotting waste hangs heavily in the air, burning the inside of their nostrils and stifling breaths. The volunteers begin to organize into different teams. Some pick litter off the ground. Others take a canoe and nets into the stagnant water. They collect plastic containers, banana peels, and anything else that has pooled in or near the lake over months and years. Some volunteers even dive into the murky water searching for waste.\n\nDhaka is home to over 36 million people and growing fast. It is expected to become the world’s largest urban center before the year 2050. But municipal services have not been able to keep up with its breakneck growth, making the city one of the world’s most polluted as well. More than half of its daily trash is not collected.\n\n“All of us young volunteers are working hard to clean [up] and represent our country to the world,” said Umme Kulsum Siddiki Brishti, a university student, as she took a break during the Uttara clean up. “We are trying to change people’s mindset.”\n\nBangladesh Clean volunteer and university student Umme Kulsum Siddiki Brishti takes a break during the Uttara cleanup of one of the canals in a neighborhood in northern Dhaka. “Nowadays people are getting more aware, and I believe the situation will improve because humans can change,” she said. Omar Hamed Beato\n\nBangladesh Clean, the group that organized the day’s volunteers, is not just a beautification effort. In a country where more than 272,000 premature deaths are associated with pollution every year, it’s an acknowledgment that the stakes are life-or-death. Between 1901 and 2019, average temperatures in Bangladesh have increased by nearly 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) during some months. This warming, coupled with increasingly irregular rainfall patterns, is leading to longer summer rainy seasons and warmer winters. Mosquitoes are now breeding more rapidly, bringing with them diseases like dengue and chikungunya. The insects thrive in warm, humid environments rich in the kind of organic matter found in much of Dhaka’s waste.\n\nBangladesh Clean has become one model for how residents are taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSewage mixed with chemicals trickles out from a textile factory. Mosquito larvae can survive even in moderately polluted water.\n\nOmar Hamed Beato\n\nThe organization was founded in 2016 and today is composed of more than 50,000 volunteers, mostly teenagers and young adults recruited through social media and word of mouth. Every Friday, they fan out across the country to clean waterways and neighborhoods. Since its founding, the group says it has organized about 15,000 cleanup events across the country. Rahat Sarker Hridoy joined the cleanups in 2021 after seeing the group advertised on Facebook; he has been a regular ever since.\n\n“It’s important for my country, I never get tired of doing these [events]. I dream one day my country will be neat and clean,” he said during the Uttara cleanup, soaked in contaminated water. “I can’t do this alone. That’s why I joined the organization.”\n\nPopulation growth and unplanned urbanization make waste extremely difficult to manage in Dhaka. Omar Hamed Beato\n\nBangladesh has experienced big spikes in mosquito-borne diseases, especially dengue and chikungunya, in recent years. In 2023, there were 321,179 reported cases of dengue and 1,705 deaths — the country’s worst outbreak on record. Official numbers were smaller last year, just over 100,000 cases, but health experts warn it is likely an undercount. Only a fraction of hospitals document dengue infections, while limited access to healthcare in rural areas leaves many cases undiagnosed.\n\n“Without action by the people, without action by society, [dengue] is not possible to manage,” said Karibul Bashar, an entomologist and epidemiologist at Jahangirnagar University and advisor to the World Health Organization in Southeast Asia. “There are a lot of small containers, canned food, packaged food, polythene sheets, polythene bags, and plastic bags everywhere.” Even a small amount of water in any plastic bag or plastic cup is enough for mosquitoes to breed, he added.\n\nBags can be breeding grounds for mosquitoes since they can hold water inside them for long periods of time. Omar Hamed Beato\n\nBashar is developing an artificial intelligence system that can help predict future outbreaks. His approach involves placing mosquito traps in neighborhoods and analyzing both mosquito populations and the number of infected people in surrounding areas.\n\n“We can develop an early warning system,” he said, surrounded by dengue-infected mosquitoes in his laboratory on the outskirts of Dhaka. “If the mosquito density is high in a place where patients are already present, we can say the disease will spread rapidly. [It] can flag this on a government server, showing where the next hotspot is likely to emerge in the next two or three weeks for dengue.”\n\nEarly warning means the potential for quick action and control, he said.\n\nKaribul Bashar observes mosquitoes through a microscope in his lab. Omar Hamed Beato\n\nSlides show the life cycle of an Aedes mosquito. After hatching, mosquito larvae need water and organic matter to develop into fully grown mosquitoes. Adults, which are capable of transmitting dengue, are indigenous to tropical areas, yet are now found in every continent but Antarctica. As the climate changes and the world becomes more connected, Bashar believes that mosquito-borne diseases “will be a very big threat in the future” around the world. Omar Hamed Beato\n\nFor decades, millions of Bangladeshis have flocked to cities in search of new economic opportunities and to flee small towns and villages inundated during the monsoon. But the crowded neighborhoods make them powerful incubators for mosquito-borne diseases. This was the case for Nilufar Begum, who lives with seven of her relatives in a tiny home covered by steel plates. Begum and her 4-year-old granddaughter were diagnosed with chikungunya last August. While not as severe as dengue, its effects can last for months, if not years. When Grist visited the family a month after the infection, they were still experiencing headaches and muscle pain.\n\n“The mosquitos are unbearable now. There were not this many 10 years ago,” Begum said, sitting on a bed in the dark room where her family sleeps. It had been a year since the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed was ousted from power after weeks of student-led protests that resulted in the government killing 1,400 people. Begum said that the political turmoil had taken a toll on basic civic functions; the interim government had been struggling to provide services once common in her area such as fumigation, trash collection, and drain clearance.\n\nA member of South Dhaka City Corporation fumigates one of the city’s neighborhoods. Fumigation can be counterproductive because it poses health risks to humans and kills mosquitoes’ natural predators. It also doesn’t reach buildings’ private interiors, where mosquitoes can easily grow in bathrooms and kitchens. Omar Hamed Beato\n\nAll of this has a ripple effect in healthcare centers unable to cope with the influx of patients. Many who end up there wait in crowded corridors without beds or medicine, as Grist observed during a visit to the Mugda Medical College Hospital in September. Families with children crowded the halls, waiting to be attended by medical personnel who could not do much besides providing pain relief and monitoring vital signs, as dengue has no specific treatment.\n\n“We had to buy all the medicine [ourselves],” said Rubina Begum, who almost burst into tears while holding her unconscious dengue-infected 2-year-old son, Omar, in her arms at the hospital. “The hospital only provided one bag of saline [solution] at the beginning. Until now, the medicine has cost us 8,000 Taka [equivalent to $65] in total.”\n\nFamily members sit with loved ones infected with dengue fever at Mugda Medical College Hospital. Doctors say many patients delay seeking medical help due to not being able to afford treatment. Omar Hamed Beato\n\nIt’s common in Bangladesh for the vast majority of medical expenses to be covered by patients out-of-pocket — a tall order in a country where 1 in 3 people earns less than $5 per day. According to an interview with an official from the country’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh only invests 0.78 percent of its gross domestic product in healthcare. By comparison, countries like India and Indonesia spend about double that amount, while the United States commits more than 18 times as much.\n\n“Most of the hospitals make temporary wards for six to seven weeks [during the peak of the monsoon season] by pulling some doctors and nurses from other departments,” explained Abu Sayeed Chowdhury, a senior pediatrician at Mugda Medical College Hospital. “Dengue cases are found all year now, so we should make a permanent care system for this. During the peak time, due to so many patients, sometimes there’s a shortage for saline solutions, so we should focus on the emergency preparedness for these kind of situations.”\n\nSpeaking from a government building in central Dhaka, Bangladesh’s deputy health minister Sayedur Rahman told Grist that most of the country’s health budget is directed toward prevention rather than care. “Any number of [mosquito-related] patients at the hospital is a failure of the vector control program … that is the responsibility of another ministry and local government,” said Rahman, a doctor who was appointed to the ministry a few months after the ousting of Bangladesh’s former government in August 2024. “We have 150,000 patients admitted in the hospitals right at this moment, whereas we have beds for only 110,000. So the rest — 20,000 to 30,000 patients — are on the floor in the government hospitals.”\n\nRahman also explained that his ministry does not plan to allocate more money to better equip hospitals to fight against mosquito-borne diseases. Instead, it intends to negotiate preventive measures with other ministries to reduce the need for hospital care in the first place. These ideas include instituting educational programs in schools and releasing sterilized mosquitoes into the environment to reduce mosquito populations.\n\nMosammat Shirin, left, sits at home with her daughter and granddaughter inside a mosquito net.\n\nOmar Hamed Beato\n\nBashar doubts the latter plan’s effectiveness, given the overwhelming number of disease-carrying mosquitoes already breeding in Bangladesh; he believes this population will crowd out any sterilized mosquitoes released by the government. “During the adaptation, 50 percent [of laboratory-bred] male mosquitoes will die,” he told Grist, adding that the other 50 percent will face unfavorable odds in sexual competition with local males, who are better adapted to the environment.\n\n“We can’t clean it in one day. The people living nearby have to step up so that the lake gets clean. By doing the cleaning today, we’re sending them a message that we’ve started the work of cleaning but to continue and finish it will be up to them,” said Brishti. “If people here don’t change then we can’t do anything. No matter how much we clean here it won’t matter if people don’t change their mindset.”\n\nWali-Ul Haque contributed to this story.",

      "content": "Humpback whales off the west coast of Canada have learned a cooperative hunting technique from whales migrating into the area, and this cultural knowledge may help the population cope as food becomes scarce\n\nHumpback whales work together to trap fish by surrounding them with bubbles Jenn Dickie/North Coast Cetatean society\n\nAn innovative feeding behaviour has spread rapidly through humpback whales in the fjords of western Canada, in a clear example of how cultural knowledge can help animal populations to survive.\n\nBubble-net feeding is a group hunting technique in which whales blow bubbles to corral fish, then surge upwards together to gulp them down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s an activity that’s done cooperatively, given the level of coordination and division of labour involved,” says Ellen Garland at the University of St Andrews, UK.\n\nThe behaviour has been documented for decades among humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Alaskan waters, and researchers have started seeing it recently in the northeastern Pacific population off Canada.\n\nBut it is tricky for researchers to establish whether complex behaviours like this are transmitted through social learning — rather than being independently discovered by multiple individuals.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nTo tease apart the process, Éadin O’Mahony at the University of St Andrews and her colleagues analysed field observation data from 2004 to 2023, focusing on 526 individuals living in the Kitimat Fjord System in British Columbia, within Gitga’at First Nation territory.\n\nThe team identified the whales using images of their tail flukes, which are unique to each animal. The data shows that 254 individuals performed bubble-net feeding at least once, and about 90 per cent of these events occurred in a cooperative context.\n\nThe behaviour also appeared to take off after 2014, coinciding with a major marine heatwave in the north-east Pacific that reduced prey availability.\n\n“With the heatwave, as prey availability went down, a whale’s ability to change feeding behaviour would help it maintain its daily calorie intake,” says O’Mahony.\n\nWhales were more likely to adopt bubble-net feeding if they regularly associated with others that already used the technique. Bubble-net feeding was probably introduced in the region by whales migrating from elsewhere in the north-east Pacific, but the pattern points mainly to the behaviour spreading through local social networks, carried by stable groups and influential individuals.\n\n“What we see from the heatwave years onward is an increase in whales already in the area who previously didn’t take part in bubble-net feeding,” says O’Mahony.\n\nHumpback whales’ ability to pass on knowledge through social groups may be vital to their survival, and understanding their culture could help us protect them, the researchers say.\n\n“It’s not just about how many animals are left, but about whether the social behaviours that make the population function are coming back too,” says Ted Cheeseman, co-founder of the citizen science platform Happywhale, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\nJournal reference: Proceedings of the Royal Society B DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2025.2409",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Humpback whales live along the west coast of Canada, where food has become harder to find because of changes in ocean temperatures. They need new ways to catch fish to survive.\n\n**What happened** – Some whales that migrated into the area brought a special hunting method called bubble-net feeding. In this method, whales blow bubbles to trap fish in a circle, then swim up together to catch them. Researchers studied 526 whales from 2004 to 2023 and found that many learned this trick by watching and working with others in their groups.\n\n**Impact** – This shows that humpback whales can learn from each other and share skills, not just rely on instinct. The bubble-net feeding helps them catch enough food even when fish are scarce. It also proves that whale groups have a kind of culture, passing knowledge from one whale to another, which is rare in animals.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will keep watching how this behavior spreads and how it helps whales survive as the ocean keeps changing. Understanding whale culture might help protect them better in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Humpback whales off Canada have learned a group hunting method from each other that helps them catch fish when food is scarce, showing how animals can share useful skills to adapt.\n",
