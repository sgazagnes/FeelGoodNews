      "title": "Statins may help almost everyone with type 2 diabetes live longer",
      "summary": "New research suggests statins may protect adults with type 2 diabetes regardless of how low their predicted heart risk appears. In a large UK study, statin use was linked to fewer deaths and major cardiac events across all risk levels. Even those labeled “low risk” benefited, challenging long-held assumptions about who should receive preventive therapy. Side effects were rare and generally mild.",
      "content": "A large long-term study has found that statins, a widely used class of cholesterol-lowering medications, significantly reduce the risk of death and serious heart-related problems in adults with type 2 diabetes. Importantly, these benefits were seen even in people who were considered to have a low chance of developing heart disease within the next 10 years. This challenges a long-standing debate over whether preventive statin treatment is worthwhile for patients who appear to be at lower cardiovascular risk.\n\nStatins are commonly prescribed to lower LDL cholesterol, what many people know as bad cholesterol. High LDL levels are linked to clogged arteries, heart attacks, and strokes. People with type 2 diabetes already face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, but doctors have not always agreed on whether statins are necessary for those whose short-term heart risk appears minimal. The new findings suggest that statins may offer protective effects for a much wider group of diabetes patients than previously believed. The study was published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe research team, led by scientists from the University of Hong Kong, examined health records from the IQVIA Medical Research Data (IMRD)-UK database. Their goal was to assess both the effectiveness and safety of starting statin therapy for primary prevention. Primary prevention refers to preventing a first heart attack or stroke before any such event has occurred.\n\nThe study focused on adults in the United Kingdom with type 2 diabetes between the ages of 25 and 84. Participants were followed for as long as 10 years. At the start of the study, none of the individuals had serious heart disease or significant liver problems, allowing researchers to more clearly assess the effects of statins without interference from existing severe conditions.\n\nStatins Reduced Death and Heart Events at Every Risk Level\n\nResearchers compared people who began taking statins with those who did not, grouping them based on their predicted 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This risk estimate is commonly used in clinical practice to guide treatment decisions.\n\nAcross all risk categories, statin use was linked to lower rates of death from any cause and fewer major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Even participants classified as low risk experienced measurable benefits, which directly challenges the assumption that statins only help people already at high risk of heart disease.\n\nSafety Findings and What They Mean for Patients\n\nIn terms of safety, the researchers observed a very small increase in myopathy in one risk group. Myopathy refers to muscle-related side effects, which can include weakness or soreness and are a known but uncommon concern with statin use. No increase in liver-related problems was found, addressing another common worry among patients and clinicians.\n\nBased on these results, the authors concluded that doctors should carefully consider the advantages of statin therapy for all adults with type 2 diabetes, even when a person's short-term predicted risk of cardiovascular disease is low. The findings suggest that relying solely on short-term risk estimates may cause some patients to miss out on treatments that could help them live longer and avoid serious heart complications.",

Northwestern scientists discovered this hidden mechanism and created an antibody that strips away the tumor’s protective signal.

      "content": "Scientists at Northwestern have uncovered a clever trick that helps pancreatic cancer hide from the immune system -- and a potential way to stop it.\n\nPancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers, often found too late and difficult to treat with current therapies\n\nResearchers uncovered a sugar-based coating that allows pancreatic tumors to hide from the immune system\n\nAn experimental antibody removed that disguise, allowing immune cells to attack the cancer and slow tumor growth in mice\n\nThe research team is now refining the antibody and preparing for early studies in humans\n\nPancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat, in part because it often does not respond to even the most advanced immune-based therapies. Scientists at Northwestern Medicine have now uncovered a key reason why. Their research shows that pancreatic tumors use a sugar-based disguise to avoid detection by the immune system. The team also developed an experimental antibody that blocks this deceptive signal and allows immune cells to recognize the cancer again.\n\nThe researchers identified this immune evasion strategy for the first time and demonstrated that interfering with it using a monoclonal antibody can restore immune activity. In preclinical mouse studies, immune cells became active again and began attacking cancer cells.\n\n\"It took our team about six years to uncover this novel mechanism, develop the right antibodies and test them,\" said study senior author Mohamed Abdel-Mohsen, associate professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n\"Seeing it work was a major breakthrough.\"\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Cancer Research (published by the American Association for Cancer Research).\n\nWhy Pancreatic Cancer Evades Treatment\n\nPancreatic cancer remains among the deadliest forms of cancer. It is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, offers limited treatment options, and has a five-year survival rate of only 13%. Unlike some other cancers, it often does not respond well to immunotherapies.\n\nOne reason is that immune activity inside pancreatic tumors is unusually low. \"We set out to learn why, and whether we could flip that environment, so immune cells attack tumor cells instead of ignoring or even helping them,\" Abdel-Mohsen said.\n\nThe research team discovered that pancreatic tumors take advantage of a protective system normally used by healthy cells. Under normal circumstances, healthy cells display a sugar called sialic acid on their surface. This sugar sends a signal to the immune system that essentially says, \"don't harm me.\"\n\nHow Tumors Use a Sugar-Based Disguise\n\nThe scientists found that pancreatic cancer cells copy this strategy. Tumors add the same sugar to a surface protein known as integrin α3β1. This sugar-coated protein can then bind to a receptor on immune cells called Siglec-10, triggering a false signal that tells immune cells to stand down.\n\n\"In short, the tumor sugar-coats itself -- a classic wolf-in-sheep's-clothing move -- to escape immune surveillance,\" Abdel-Mohsen explained.\n\nDeveloping an Antibody to Block the Signal\n\nAfter uncovering this hidden mechanism, the Northwestern team worked to create monoclonal antibodies capable of blocking it. When tested in laboratory experiments and in two animal models, the antibodies restored immune activity. Immune cells began engulfing cancer cells, and tumor growth slowed significantly compared with untreated mice.\n\nCreating the antibody required extensive testing. \"When you make an antibody, you test what are called hybridomas, cells that produce antibodies. We screened thousands before finding the one that worked,\" Abdel-Mohsen said.\n\nThe researchers now plan to study how the antibody performs alongside existing chemotherapy and immunotherapy options. \"There's a strong scientific rationale to believe combination therapy will allow us to reach our ultimate goal: a full remission,\" he said. \"We don't want only a 40% tumor reduction or slowing down. We want to remove the cancer altogether.\"\n\nMoving Toward Human Studies\n\nAccording to Abdel-Mohsen, the team is currently refining the antibody for use in humans and preparing for early safety and dosing studies. At the same time, researchers are testing the therapy in combination with standard treatments and developing a diagnostic test to identify which patients have tumors that rely on this sugar-based pathway. This approach could help doctors match the therapy to the patients most likely to benefit.\n\nIf progress continues as expected, Abdel-Mohsen estimates the treatment could be available to patients in about five years.\n\nThe implications may extend beyond pancreatic cancer. \"We're now asking whether the same sugar-coat trick shows up in other hard-to-treat cancers, such as glioblastoma, and in non-cancer diseases where the immune system is misled,\" he said.\n\nA Growing Field of Sugar-Based Immunology\n\nAbdel-Mohsen's laboratory focuses on glyco-immunology, an emerging area of research that examines how sugars influence immune responses. \"We're just scratching the surface of this field,\" he said. \"Here at Northwestern, we're positioned to turn these sugar-based insights into real treatments for cancer, infectious diseases and aging-related conditions.\"\n\nAbdel-Mohsen is a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.\n\nThe paper is titled \"Targeting Interactions Between Siglec-10 and α3β1 Integrin Enhances Macrophage-Mediated Phagocytosis of Pancreatic Cancer.\" The research was supported in part by Northwestern University's Center for Human Immunobiology Pilot Award, 2025-2026 to Abdel-Mohsen.

      "content": "Tryptophan is widely known for its connection to sleep, but its importance goes much further. The compounds produced from tryptophan help build proteins, generate cellular energy (NAD+), and create essential brain chemicals such as serotonin and melatonin. Together, these processes support mood, learning, and healthy sleep patterns.\n\nAs the brain ages or develops neurological disease, this system begins to break down. Scientists have repeatedly observed disruptions in how tryptophan is processed in aging brains, with even stronger effects seen in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. These changes are linked to worsening mood, impaired learning, and disturbed sleep. Until now, however, researchers did not know what caused the brain to shift how it uses tryptophan in the first place.\n\nSIRT6 Identified as a Key Regulator of Brain Chemistry\n\nProf. Debra Toiber and her research team at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev have now uncovered a clear biological explanation. Their work points to the loss of a longevity-related protein called Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) as the driving factor behind this metabolic imbalance.\n\nUsing experiments in cells, Drosophila (fly), and mouse models, the researchers showed that SIRT6 plays an active role in controlling gene expression (e.g., TDO2, AANAT). When SIRT6 levels drop, this control is lost. As a result, tryptophan is redirected toward the kynurenic pathway, which produces neurotoxic compounds, while the production of protective neurotransmitters such as serotonin and melatonin declines.\n\nPublished Evidence and a Reversible Effect\n\nThe findings were recently published in Nature Communications.\n\nImportantly, the researchers also found that the damage caused by this shift is not permanent. In a SIRT6 knockout fly model, blocking the enzyme TDO2 led to a significant improvement in movement problems and reduced the formation of vacuoles, which are signs of brain tissue damage. These results suggest that there may be a meaningful window for therapeutic intervention.\n\n\"Our research positions SIRT6 as a critical, upstream drug target for combating neurodegenerative pathology,\" says Prof. Toiber.\n\nResearch Team and Funding Support\n\nAdditional researchers include: Shai Kaluski-Kopatch, Daniel Stein, Alfredo Garcia Venzor, Ana Margarida Ferreira Campos, Melanie Planque, Bareket Goldstein, Estefanía De Allende-Becerra, Dmitrii Smirnov, Adam Zaretsky, Dr Ekaterina Eremenko -- Sgibnev, Miguel Portillo, Monica Einav, Alena Bruce Krejci, Uri Abdu, Ekaterina Khrameeva, Daniel Gitler, and Sarah-Maria Fendt.\n\nThe study was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 849029), the David and Inez Myers foundation, the Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the High-tech, Bio-tech and Negev fellowships of Kreitman School of Advanced Research of Ben-Gurion University and The Israel Science Foundation (Grant no. 422/23).

Genetic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer and familial hypercholesterolaemia (high cholesterol), as recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention1, can identify people who are at increased risk of these conditions long before they develop. This enables enhanced screening or treatment to prevent their often devastating consequences. Yet large-scale, population-wide genetic screening remains an unattained goal, with few studies having tested its feasibility and impact outside of selected private health systems. Writing in Nature Health, Lacaze et al.2 evaluated the uptake and yield (the number of at-risk individuals identified) of genetic screening among roughly 30,000 adults aged 18–40 years in a prospective nationwide pilot in Australia.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00035-8\n\nReferences Murray, M.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Cancer and heart disease cause many deaths in rich countries. These illnesses often show symptoms only when they are very advanced, making treatment harder. Genetic screening can find people at risk before symptoms appear, but it has not been done widely across whole countries.\n\n**What happened** – In Australia, researchers tested genetic screening on about 30,000 adults aged 18 to 40. This nationwide study checked if young people would take part and how many at-risk individuals could be found. The screening looked for risks linked to cancers and heart conditions caused by inherited genes.\n\n**Impact** – The study showed genetic screening can successfully find people at risk early, before they get sick. This means doctors can offer better monitoring or treatment to prevent serious illness later. It is one of the largest tests of such screening in a whole country and focused on young adults, who usually do not get screened.\n\n**What’s next step** – Researchers want to see if this approach works well in other countries and if the benefits outweigh the costs. More studies will check how to make genetic screening widely available and affordable.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Australia’s large study shows genetic screening in young adults can spot disease risks early, opening new ways to prevent serious illness.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Le cancer et les maladies cardiaques causent de nombreux décès dans les pays riches. Ces maladies montrent souvent des symptômes seulement à un stade avancé, rendant le traitement plus difficile. Le dépistage génétique peut identifier les personnes à risque avant l'apparition des symptômes, mais il n'a pas été largement utilisé à l'échelle nationale.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – En Australie, des chercheurs ont testé le dépistage génétique sur environ 30 000 adultes âgés de 18 à 40 ans. Cette étude nationale a examiné la participation des jeunes et combien de personnes à risque pouvaient être détectées. Le dépistage cherchait des risques liés à certains cancers et maladies cardiaques héréditaires.\n\n**Impact** – L'étude a montré que le dépistage génétique peut identifier avec succès les personnes à risque tôt, avant qu'elles ne tombent malades. Cela permet aux médecins de proposer une meilleure surveillance ou un traitement pour prévenir une maladie grave plus tard. C’est l’un des plus grands tests de ce type à l’échelle d’un pays, ciblant les jeunes adultes.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs veulent vérifier si cette méthode fonctionne dans d’autres pays et si les avantages justifient les coûts. D’autres études examineront comment rendre ce dépistage accessible et abordable.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – La grande étude australienne montre que le dépistage génétique chez les jeunes adultes peut détecter tôt les risques de maladie, ouvrant la voie à la prévention.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – El cáncer y las enfermedades del corazón causan muchas muertes en países ricos. Estas enfermedades suelen mostrar síntomas solo en etapas avanzadas, lo que dificulta el tratamiento. El cribado genético puede identificar a personas en riesgo antes de que aparezcan los síntomas, pero no se ha realizado a gran escala en países enteros.\n\n**Qué pasó** – En Australia, investigadores probaron el cribado genético en unos 30,000 adultos de 18 a 40 años. Este estudio nacional evaluó cuántos jóvenes participaron y cuántas personas en riesgo se detectaron. El cribado buscó riesgos relacionados con ciertos cánceres y enfermedades cardíacas hereditarias.\n\n**Impacto** – El estudio mostró que el cribado genético puede encontrar a personas en riesgo temprano, antes de que se enfermen. Esto permite a los médicos ofrecer mejor seguimiento o tratamiento para prevenir enfermedades graves más adelante. Es uno de los estudios más grandes de este tipo en un país, centrado en adultos jóvenes.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores quieren saber si esta estrategia funciona en otros países y si los beneficios justifican los costos. Se realizarán más estudios para hacer que el cribado genético sea accesible y asequible.\n\n**Frase clave** – El gran estudio australiano demuestra que el cribado genético en adultos jóvenes puede detectar riesgos de enfermedad temprano, abriendo nuevas formas de prevenir enfermedades graves.",
