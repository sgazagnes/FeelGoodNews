      "title": "New low temperature fuel cell could transform hydrogen power",
      "summary": "Kyushu University scientists have achieved a major leap in fuel cell technology by enabling efficient proton transport at just 300°C. Their scandium-doped oxide materials create a wide, soft pathway that lets protons move rapidly without clogging the crystal lattice. This solves a decades-old barrier in solid-oxide fuel cell development and could make hydrogen power far more affordable.",
      "content": "As global demand for energy continues to rise, researchers, industry leaders, governments, and other stakeholders are working together to explore new ways of producing power. This effort has become even more urgent as the world confronts the climate crisis and looks for alternatives to fossil fuels.\n\nOne technology attracting significant attention is the solid-oxide fuel cell, or SOFC. Unlike batteries, which release stored chemical energy, these fuel cells convert chemical fuels directly into electricity and keep generating power as long as fuel is available. Many people are already familiar with hydrogen fuel cells, which use hydrogen gas to produce electricity and water.\n\nWhy High Operating Temperatures Are a Major Challenge\n\nAlthough SOFCs are known for their high efficiency and long operational life, they have a serious limitation: they need extremely high temperatures of around 700-800°C to function properly. Reaching and maintaining these temperatures requires specialized materials that can withstand intense heat, which makes the systems expensive.\n\nResearchers at Kyushu University, reporting in Nature Materials, now say they have developed an SOFC that works efficiently at just 300°C. According to the team, this breakthrough could greatly reduce costs, support the creation of low-temperature SOFCs, and speed up their real-world use.\n\nThe Key Role of Electrolytes in Fuel Cell Performance\n\nAt the core of every SOFC is a component called the electrolyte, a ceramic layer that moves charged particles between the fuel cell's electrodes. In hydrogen fuel cells, this layer carries hydrogen ions (a.k.a. protons), allowing the cell to generate electricity. However, the electrolyte typically needs extremely high temperatures to keep these protons moving fast enough for efficient operation.\n\n\"Bringing the working temperature down to 300°C it would slash material costs and open the door to consumer-level systems,\" says Professor Yoshihiro Yamazaki of Kyushu University's Platform of Inter-/Transdisciplinary Energy Research, who directed the study. \"However, no known ceramic could carry enough protons that fast at such 'warm' conditions. So, we set out to break that bottleneck.\"\n\nSolving the Dopant Problem in Crystal Lattices\n\nElectrolytes are built from atoms arranged in a crystal lattice. Protons move through the gaps between these atoms. Scientists have spent years testing various materials and chemical dopants -- substances that modify a material's properties -- in hopes of increasing the speed of proton movement through the lattice.\n\n\"But this also comes with a challenge,\" Yamazaki explains. \"Adding chemical dopants can increase the number of mobile protons passing through an electrolyte, but it usually clogs the crystal lattice, slowing the protons down. We looked for oxide crystals that could host many protons and let them move freely -- a balance that our new study finally struck.\"\n\nA 300°C Breakthrough Using Sc-Doped BaSnO3 and BaTiO3\n\nThe team discovered that two oxides, barium stannate (BaSnO 3 ) and barium titanate (BaTiO 3 ), when doped with high levels of scandium (Sc), reached the target proton conductivity of more than 0.01 S/cm at 300°C. This conductivity is similar to what today's SOFC electrolytes achieve at 600-700°C.\n\n\"Structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Sc atoms link their surrounding oxygens to form a 'ScO 6 highway,' along which protons travel with an unusually low migration barrier. This pathway is both wide and softly vibrating, which prevents the proton-trapping that normally plagues heavily doped oxides,\" says Yamazaki. \"Lattice-dynamics data further revealed that BaSnO 3 and BaTiO 3 are intrinsically 'softer' than conventional SOFC materials, letting them absorb far more Sc than previously assumed.\"\n\nOpening the Door to Affordable Low-Temperature Fuel Cells\n\nThese results overturn the long-standing trade-off between adding more dopants and maintaining fast ion movement, providing a promising path toward affordable, intermediate-temperature SOFCs.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are devices that turn fuels like hydrogen into electricity. They are efficient but usually need very high temperatures around 700-800°C to work well, which makes them expensive and hard to use widely.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Kyushu University found a way to make SOFCs work efficiently at just 300°C. They used special materials called scandium-doped barium stannate and barium titanate. These materials create a smooth path inside the fuel cell that allows protons to move quickly without getting stuck, something that was difficult before.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it solves a problem that limited SOFCs for decades. Lowering the temperature needed means cheaper materials can be used, making fuel cells more affordable. This could help more people and industries use hydrogen power, which produces clean energy.\n\n**What's next step** – The research team will likely work on building practical low-temperature SOFCs for real-world use. This may lead to new energy devices that are cheaper and easier to maintain, speeding up the shift to cleaner energy sources.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Kyushu University scientists created a new fuel cell material that allows hydrogen power to work well at much lower temperatures, making clean energy more affordable and accessible.",

      "title": "After COP30, Indigenous advocates celebrate gains while warning of unfinished work",
      "summary": "The COP30 climate conference in Belém, billed as the “Indigenous COP,” was defined by the organized presence of Indigenous activists, who staged protests and demanded inclusion in negotiations. Their advocacy led to tangible successes, notably Brazil’s promise to demarcate more Indigenous lands and the U.N.’s formal recognition of Indigenous rights, including Free, Prior, and Informed Consent, in the Just Transition Work Programme.\n\nDespite these gains, Indigenous advocates were profoundly disappointed by the ultimate failure of U.N. member states to commit to a specific plan to stop relying on fossil fuels, with oil-rich nations watering down the final text. Leaders affirmed that the crucial fight for climate justice and land rights will continue through grassroots resistance, legal action, and future international forums, extending beyond the U.N. conference halls.",
      "content": "If there is one image that encapsulates COP30, this year’s global climate change conference in Belém, Brazil, it might be this: Indigenous activists, in traditional clothing and regalia, storming past security into a secure zone made for international negotiators and preapproved delegates.\n\nThe action occurred on the second day of COP30 and underscored how this conference would be different from others. This COP had been billed as the “Indigenous COP,” given the venue’s proximity to the Amazon and Brazil’s efforts to ensure Indigenous participation. But that presence was still limited by the nature of U.N. negotiations, in which member states have voting rights and Indigenous peoples who haven’t achieved internationally recognized statehood are unable to vote on decisions such as when and how to transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nYour support powers solutions-focused climate reporting — keeping it free for everyone.

On multiple days throughout the conference, they marched in the streets, blocked the doors to the conference, pushed their way in, and made sure the world knew that “they can’t decide for us without us.”\n\nTo Kaeden Watts, a climate and Indigenous rights policy expert from the Māori tribes of Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Ngāti Maniapoto, and Tūhoe, who watched the conference unfold from Aotearoa New Zealand, it was a stark contrast to previous COPs he’s attended where Indigenous perspectives were often ignored or only heard when they were amplified by non-Indigenous allies like Greta Thunberg. This time, he saw news reporters interview Indigenous demonstrators and leaders who spoke about land rights and climate harms.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\n“This time you were seeing the amplification of Indigenous voices purely from an incredible organizing effort,” Watts said. “That’s an outcome we very rarely see and it’s resulted in tangible change.”\n\nBefore the end of COP, the government of Brazil took steps to demarcate the lands of 27 Indigenous peoples throughout Brazil, and promised to recognize 59 million additional hectares over the next five years.\n\nAccording to the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, an organization representing Indigenous peoples in Brazil, more Indigenous participants were represented at this COP than in the entire 30-year history of the conference — over 5,000 Indigenous participants, including about 900 with accredited access to areas where negotiators and preapproved delegates met.\n\nIndigenous advocates went into COP wanting nation-states to agree to a clear roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels and commitments to end deforestation. They had a slew of proposals they hoped to include in the Global Mutirão, a nonbinding international agreement among U.N. members at COP30, that would protect Indigenous rights and their territories. That didn’t happen, but countries did agree to formally recognize the importance of protecting Indigenous rights, including land rights, in the Just Transition Work Programme, a U.N. program to help countries transition off of fossil fuels.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nThat’s a big deal to Emil Gualinga, who is a member of the Kichwa People of Sarayaku and participated in COP30 as a member of the International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change, an official global caucus created to enable Indigenous peoples to engage in COP negotiations. Gualinga said that this year, Panama helped ensure the Just Transition Work Programme included a reference to Indigenous peoples’ right to free, prior, and informed consent to what happens in their territories. This is increasingly important in light of studies that show mineral deposits critical to fossil fuel-free energy production are often found within Indigenous nations’ lands and waters.\n\nBut while he’s proud of that achievement, Gualinga was among many who were disappointed by the failure of U.N. member states to commit to a specific plan to stop relying upon fossil fuels, allowing the atmosphere to continue its path toward warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, which scientists have warned will wreak catastrophic consequences on Earth. The final version of the Global Mutirão was watered down by representatives from oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia and countries with growing economies like China and India.\n\n“None of our proposals were taken into account for the Global Mutirão text,” Gualinga said, noting that Mutirão is an Indigenous name. ”But even so, none of the proposals were taken into account.”\n\nStill, he isn’t discouraged. “The fight for Indigenous peoples is not only at the COP,” he added.\n\nInternational venues like COP are important spaces for environmental justice advocacy on behalf of Indigenous peoples to both defend planetary health and their rights to land and water but are just one tool among many. This is something Gualinga knows intimately; his community in the Amazon forest of southern Ecuador has spent decades fighting against oil industry efforts to drill on their lands. He was only a child when the oil industry entered their territory.\n\nThe Sarayaku people responded with organized resistance: The women snuck out in the middle of the night to steal weapons from the security forces and the village stopped fishing, hunting, and going to school for six months in order to keep vigil over their land. The Sarayaku filed local and international lawsuits alleging that the oil company’s presence violated their right to free, prior, and informed consent to what happens on their territories. In 2012, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights concluded that Ecuador had violated their rights by allowing the company to enter their territory.\n\n“You don’t know in advance which strategies are going to work,” Gualinga reflected on the local advocacy. “I think it’s a matter of being creative and seeing where to focus.”\n\nEarlier this year Pacific island nations, led in part by Indigenous students and lawyers, won a landmark decision from the International Court of Justice that made clear that national governments have a legal obligation to mitigate climate change and compensate those harmed. Many who flew to Belém from the Pacific hoped the court’s ruling would provide needed pressure to compel global action, like transitioning off of fossil fuels.\n\nBelyndar Rikimani, a Solomon Islander who attended the COP as a founding member of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change which initiated the ICJ case, was disappointed that the ruling wasn’t acknowledged. “At a moment when science is unequivocal and communities on the front lines are sounding the alarm, the absence of any reference to a fossil fuel phaseout in the decision text is a devastating failure of political courage,” she said. “We will keep pushing inside courtrooms, negotiation halls, and at the grassroots until states meet their obligations and deliver the future our generation deserves.”\n\nGualinga said he expects to see Indigenous international advocacy continue next summer in Bonn, Germany, where another U.N. conference will discuss national and international guidelines for transitioning off fossil fuels, and at the First International Conference for the Phase-Out of Fossil Fuels in Santa Marta, Colombia, next April. “For the Indigenous movement in the Amazon Basin, this is an important event, given that Indigenous peoples’ organizations have called for the Amazon, and especially Indigenous peoples’ territories, to be decreed as no-go zones for extractive industries,” he said.\n\nKaeden Watts in Aotearoa New Zealand said that he thinks the visibility of Indigenous resistance at COP30 suggests that the messages of Indigenous peoples are starting to resonate with the public. He expects the movement for Indigenous climate justice to continue to grow, undeterred by the disappointments at COP.\n\n“Ever since Indigenous peoples have had to fight for their rights — in whatever form that looked like — their advocacy and their determination for self-determination has never stopped,” he said. “And we’ll never see it stop.”",

Un método especial es la descerna, que consiste en quitar con cuidado el cuerno para que los rinocerontes sean menos atractivos para los cazadores.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta campaña es importante porque combina tecnología y ayuda de la gente para combatir la caza furtiva de formas nuevas. La descerna es una medida valiente que puede salvar a los rinocerontes sin dañarlos. Al proteger a estos animales, la campaña ayuda a mantener a salvo la vida silvestre de Sudáfrica y el equilibrio de la naturaleza.\n\n**Próximo paso** – La campaña seguirá usando estas herramientas y trabajando con más comunidades para proteger mejor a los rinocerontes. Si la caza furtiva disminuye, la población de rinocerontes podría crecer. El éxito de este programa podría inspirar a otros países a hacer esfuerzos similares.\n\n**Una frase clave** – La nueva campaña de Sudáfrica usa tecnología, apoyo comunitario y métodos inteligentes como la descerna para proteger a los rinocerontes de los cazadores furtivos y ayudar a recuperar su población.",

      "summary": "“[W]e want the Seed Library to be a place of freedom, an initiative for us to have autonomy over our food, but also over our spirit, our minds, our words.”",
      "content": "By Thin Ink\n\nThis is an excerpt of a longer interview on Thin Ink, a weekly publication on food, climate, and where they meet. Read the full interview here.\n\nVivien Sansour is the founder of the Palestine Heirloom Seed Library and a tireless advocate for food sovereignty, not just for her home country but also for the world. For years, she’s worked to preserve the seeds, crops, and stories that root Palestinians to their land.\n\nIn this interview with Thin Ink, Sansour talks about the past, present, and future of Palestinian food systems and about whether, and how, they might be revived.\n\nThin Ink (TI): Perhaps we can start by having you tell readers a bit more about the Palestine Heirloom Seed Library you set up. What was the idea behind it? What prompted you to do this, and you know, what was the motivation?\n\nVivien Sansour (VS): So the Seed Library came out of a lot of grief, really, and the idea that as a young person growing up in Palestine, I was born knowing that everything I love was under threat. So there was never a time in my life where I felt like I could take anything for granted.\n\nI was born in the late ’70s, and obviously, we were well into the Israeli occupation. So the idea that there is someone who is in control of your life was always present. I'm sure you may be familiar with that coming from where you come from.\n\nBut when I was a child, the world was very tangible and real, like my grandmother’s rabbits, my family’s apricot trees, and the almond trees where I spent a lot of my time, not just as a child, but also as a grown person. The shade of those ancient, old almond trees … it's a relationship that continues to be very much in my pores. They’re like an extension of my body, my family, my life.\n\nThese are not just romantic words. This is how I grew up. I am in love with where I come from, and the Seed Library for me was a way to basically put that love in some form of … I don't know … contemporary story and structure people relate to and understand.\n\nAfter I tried to pursue a PhD in Agriculture and Life Science, I realized I wanted to go talk to the people I grew up with and the people I had forgotten to meet. I didn’t want to waste eight years of my life in the halls of universities when I could be spending eight years of my life with elders who will not be there tomorrow, and the knowledge they have. I quit the program, went home, and just allowed myself to visit people I don’t know, go to villages, talk to random people in the street, and just share myself as much as I also received from others.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by مكتبه البذور البلدية الفلسطينية (@paliheirloomseedlibrary)\n\nIt’s very ironic, actually. After being a proud PhD dropout, I ended up being invited to the halls of academia to speak about exactly what I did.\n\nIt all makes sense to me now, because I was doing the real field work. I didn’t call it that; it was more like grief and work to preserve, honour, and keep alive the culture and the bio culture of a place and a people I belong to, but also a people who have been teachers to me.\n\nI was looking for, literally, the taste of my childhood. So every inquiry I made was more of an inquiry into something I was longing for. I was like someone who lost their lover and is trying to rebuild them through the remnants of them, right? That’s how I started collecting different seeds, like carrot or beans or arugula or spinach. And then I started sharing this with the world, and it turned out I wasn’t the only heartbroken lover.\n\nA lot of people walk around with broken hearts about their world that has been destroyed and is being destroyed. The Library now extends beyond Palestine, and we run, pretty much, a global grassroots initiative. I think it’s because people, especially Indigenous people and people who know pain and oppression, understand that we are living in a time of hospice, where a lot of what we love is dying and is being intentionally destroyed and replaced.\n\nTI: That’s both lovely and sad, and there are so many strands I want to follow up on. So you started out working to protect these seeds, as well as the stories, culture, and memories around them. And unfortunately, I'm going to have to drag you back to Palestine. The latest UN statistics show that the vast majority of farmland in Gaza has been destroyed, and those that are not destroyed are largely inaccessible. Beyond food production, what does that loss of farmland mean in terms of loss of history and culture and knowledge of your food systems?\n\nVS: First thing: I am not in the business of protecting anything. I think people keep talking about that, and I find it fascinating, because in reality, these seeds are protecting us. I mean, we are the ones who need to eat. We are the ones who need to breathe the clean oxygen. And in a lot of ways, in these times of massive grief, these seeds are keeping us alive, giving us some hope and holding within them our history. This is why we are trying to propagate them and give them space to grow wherever we can, because they are the holders of our story.\n\nSecondly, I don’t care about the UN. Fuck the UN, and fuck their reports. Also, the international organisations that claim to care about human rights and ecology. As someone often referred to as an ecologist, I feel massively betrayed by these organisations. For example, our Seed Library is in Battir, a village that’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site. And I don't see UNESCO trying to do anything to protect this site. In fact, every day we have a new settler incursion.\n\nSo please register my anger, because the world is dead silent, except for people in the grassroots who are like seeds trying to survive in environments that are completely volatile, from New York City to Burma to wherever. They’re raising their voices, whereas all those institutions were designed to keep us silent.\n\nI’ll get to your question on land, but it’s important for me to highlight that we want the Seed Library to be a place of freedom, an initiative for us to have autonomy over our food, but also over our spirit, our minds, our words. That's why I’ve always rejected any support from governmental institutions.\n\nAnd when you talk about land and the mass destruction of land, well, how can these seeds live? These seeds, especially the crop varieties that we eat, like zucchini, tomatoes, etc, are varieties developed through an incredibly imaginative, creative and scientific manner, co-creating with soil, land, water, and air. They are thousands of years old.\n\nOkra isn’t from Palestine, but travelled there, was domesticated there, and throughout years of domestication, became a very nice guest (in our cuisine), to the point where we have what we call a “ba’al okra,” where “ba’al” refers to the Canaanite deity of fertility.\n\nUntil today, we call these varieties that grow with no irrigation “ba’al.” These varieties learned and entered into relationships with the soil and the hands of people. Everything we eat today, if we’re lucky to have food on our plate, is a product of a relationship between land, soil, human and non-human elements. And so when you take away and destroy the land and the soil, you are destroying the ability to have these relations that allow continuity.\n\nIt is obviously by design that this destruction of our farmland has happened. It’s been ongoing, by the way.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by مكتبه البذور البلدية الفلسطينية (@paliheirloomseedlibrary)\n\nTI: But we gotta start somewhere, right? You’ve been doing this for a much longer time than I have been doing my journalistic work, but my thinking is that if I give up what I’m doing, I let them win, them being either the military dictators in Burma/Myanmar or the people who put private profits above public goods in terms of food and climate. But I definitely feel what I’m doing is totally inadequate.\n\nVS: You know, I don't see Palestine as an isolated story. This is not the core of why I live or why I do what I do. We live in a scorching hot world, not only as in rising temperatures, although that is, of course, part of it, but a scorching hot world of violence and of unprecedented measures. The introduction of AI, the advancement of military technology and surveillance, and the hyper capitalism we’re living in have made this planet almost uninhabitable, right?\n\nSo I don’t see what's happening to us in isolation from that. I see it as a microcosm.\n\nIn fact, I was talking to a friend in Palestine the other day, and he said, “Maybe we are the lucky ones in the sense that the way we're heading in terms of AI and climate change taking over, the hell we are living may look tender in the face of the hell the world might see.”\n\nThe President of Colombia, very intelligently, has said many times that Palestine is a test run. So watch out and wake up, world. For me and for us at the Seed Library, the vision has always been that I may not be able to change the world in my lifetime, but what I can do, as much as I can do, is create more tender spaces in the world, and expand those tender spaces as much as possible so that they can connect, but also that the next generation will have something. It was not about, “Oh, I'm going to liberate Palestine.”\n\nOur work is about reminding people that there is still life worth fighting for. What is the saying where you plant a seed for others to live in its shade? That’s it.",
