      "title": "Jupiter’s clouds are hiding something big",
      "summary": "Jupiter’s swirling storms have concealed its true makeup for centuries, but a new model is finally peeling back the clouds. Researchers found the planet likely holds significantly more oxygen than the Sun, a key clue to how Jupiter—and the rest of the solar system—came together. The study also reveals that gases move through Jupiter’s atmosphere much more slowly than scientists once thought. Together, the findings reshape our understanding of the solar system’s largest planet.",
      "content": "Towering clouds ripple across Jupiter's surface in dramatic patterns. Like Earth's clouds, they contain water, but on Jupiter they are far denser and far deeper. These layers are so thick that no spacecraft has been able to directly observe what lies below them.\n\nNow, scientists have taken a major step toward solving that mystery. A new study led by researchers at the University of Chicago and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has produced the most detailed model of Jupiter's atmosphere ever created. The work provides a deeper look into the planet's interior without needing to physically descend into its crushing depths.\n\nOne of the study's key findings helps resolve a long running debate about Jupiter's composition. The researchers estimate that the gas giant contains roughly one and a half times more oxygen than the sun. That result sharpens scientists' understanding of how Jupiter and the rest of the solar system took shape.\n\n\"This is a long-standing debate in planetary studies,\" said Jeehyun Yang, a postdoctoral researcher at UChicago and the study's lead author. \"It's a testament to how the latest generation of computational models can transform our understanding of other planets.\"\n\nThe study was published Jan. 8 in The Planetary Science Journal.\n\nStorms, Clouds, and Chemical Clues\n\nAstronomers have been watching Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere for centuries. More than 360 years ago, early telescope observations revealed a massive, persistent feature on the planet's surface.\n\nThat feature is now known as the Great Red Spot, a colossal storm roughly twice the size of Earth that has raged for hundreds of years. It is only one part of a planet-wide system of violent winds and thick clouds that blanket Jupiter in nearly constant motion.\n\nWhile these storms are visible from afar, what lies beneath them remains largely unknown. Jupiter's clouds are so dense that NASA's Galileo spacecraft lost contact with Earth when it plunged into the planet's atmosphere in 2003. Today, NASA's Juno mission studies Jupiter from orbit, gathering data from a safe distance.\n\nFrom orbit, scientists can identify chemicals in the upper atmosphere, including ammonia, methane, ammonium hydrosulfide, water, and carbon monoxide. Researchers combine those measurements with known chemical reactions to infer what may be happening deeper below the clouds.\n\nEven so, past studies have reached conflicting conclusions, especially when estimating how much water and oxygen Jupiter contains. Yang recognized that new modeling techniques could help resolve those disagreements.\n\nA New Way to Model Jupiter's Atmosphere\n\nJupiter's atmosphere is a chemical maze. Molecules move between scorching temperatures deep inside the planet and cooler regions above, shifting between different states and rearranging themselves through thousands of reactions. On top of that, clouds and droplets form, dissolve, and interact with their surroundings.\n\nTo capture all of this complexity, Yang and colleagues combined atmospheric chemistry with hydrodynamics in a single model. This approach allows the simulation to track both chemical reactions and the movement of gases, clouds, and droplets together.\n\n\"You need both,\" Yang said. \"Chemistry is important but doesn't include water droplets or cloud behavior. Hydrodynamics alone simplifies the chemistry too much. So, it's important to bring them together.\"\n\nThis combined approach had not been done before at this level of detail, and it led to several important insights.\n\nOxygen, Water, and Planetary Origins\n\nThe model produced a new estimate of Jupiter's oxygen content, pointing again to a value of about one and a half times that of the sun. This contrasts with a recent high profile study that suggested Jupiter might contain only about a third as much oxygen.\n\nPinning down this number matters because oxygen plays a major role in planetary formation. The elements that make up planets and living things originated in the sun, but their proportions can vary from world to world. Those differences offer clues about how planets formed and where they came from.\n\nOne open question is whether Jupiter formed where it currently orbits or whether it migrated over time. Much of the planet's oxygen is locked into water, which behaves very differently depending on temperature. Farther from the sun, water freezes into ice, which is easier for growing planets to collect than water vapor.\n\nUnderstanding those conditions does not just explain Jupiter's past. It also helps scientists predict what kinds of planets might form around other stars and which ones could potentially support life.\n\nA Slower, More Mysterious Atmosphere\n\nThe model also suggests that Jupiter's atmosphere circulates far more slowly than scientists once believed. Vertical movement of gases appears to be dramatically reduced compared to standard assumptions.\n\n\"Our model suggests the diffusion would have to be 35 to 40 times slower compared to what the standard assumption has been,\" said Yang. Instead of moving through an atmospheric layer in hours, a single molecule might take several weeks.\n\n\"It really shows how much we still have to learn about planets, even in our own solar system,\" Yang said.\n\nFunding: NASA, Caltech-Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",

      "title": "Puffy baby planets reveal a missing stage of planet formation",
      "summary": "A young star called V1298 Tau is giving astronomers a front-row seat to the birth of the galaxy’s most common planets. Four massive but extremely low-density worlds orbiting the star appear to be inflated precursors of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. By watching how the planets subtly tug on one another, scientists measured their masses and confirmed they are far puffier than expected. The system reveals how these planets dramatically shrink and transform as they age.",
      "content": "Astronomers were surprised to learn in recent years that most Sun-like stars host at least one planet that falls between Earth and Neptune in size and orbits closer than Mercury does in our own solar system -- sizes and orbits absent from our solar system. These worlds, known as super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, turn out to be the most abundant type of planet in the Milky Way. Yet for all their prevalence, how they form has remained unclear. An international research team has now identified a long-missing piece of that puzzle by directly measuring four extremely young planets as they evolve toward these common planetary forms.\n\nBy studying the V1298 Tau system, the researchers captured an unusually early snapshot of planetary development. Their measurements reveal planets caught in the act of changing into the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes seen throughout the galaxy.\n\n\"What's so exciting is that we're seeing a preview of what will become a very normal planetary system,\" says John Livingston, the study's lead author from the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo, Japan. \"The four planets we studied will likely contract into 'super-Earths' and 'sub-Neptunes' -- the most common types of planets in our galaxy, but we've never had such a clear picture of them in their formative years.\"\n\nA Young Star System Frozen in Time\n\nV1298 Tau is remarkably young by astronomical standards, at just about 20 million years old -- a blink of an eye compared to the Sun's 4.5-billion-year history. Four large planets circle this energetic star, each ranging in size from Neptune to Jupiter. These worlds appear to be in a short-lived and chaotic stage of rapid change, offering a glimpse of what many mature planetary systems once looked like.\n\nAstronomers believe this system represents an early version of the tightly packed, multi-planet systems commonly found across the galaxy. Much like the Rosetta Stone helped scientists interpret ancient hieroglyphics, V1298 Tau provides a key reference for understanding how the galaxy's most common planets take shape.\n\nMeasuring Planetary Mass Without Doppler Signals\n\nOver a ten-year period, the team relied on a combination of space-based and ground-based telescopes to monitor the system. They tracked the precise moments when each planet crossed in front of its star, events called transits. These observations revealed that the planets' orbits were not perfectly steady. Instead, the planets subtly pulled on one another, causing small but measurable changes in their transit timing.\n\nThese variations, known as Transit-Timing Variations (TTVs), allowed scientists to calculate the planets' masses directly for the first time.\n\n\"For astronomers, our go-to 'Doppler' method for weighing planets involves making careful measurements of the star's velocity as it's tugged by its retinue of planets.\" said Erik Petigura, a co-author from UCLA. \"But young stars are so extremely spotty, active, and temperamental, that the Doppler method is a non-starter.\" By using TTVs, we essentially used the planets' own gravity against each other. Precisely timing how they tug on their neighbors allowed us to calculate their masses, and sidestep the issues with this young star.\"\n\nPlanets as Light as Cosmic Cotton Candy\n\nThe mass measurements revealed a striking result. Even though the planets are five to ten times larger than Earth, their masses are only five to fifteen times greater. This combination makes them extraordinarily low in density -- more like planetary-sized cotton candy than solid, rocky worlds.\n\n\"The unusually large radii of young planets led to the hypothesis that they have very low densities, but this had never been measured,\" said Trevor David, a co-author from the Flatiron Institute who led the system's original discovery in 2019. \"By weighing these planets for the first time, we have provided the first observational proof. They are indeed exceptionally 'puffy,' which gives us a crucial, long-awaited benchmark for theories of planet evolution.\"\n\nLosing Atmospheres and Shrinking Over Time\n\nThis extreme puffiness helps resolve a long-standing question in planet formation. If planets simply formed and cooled slowly, they would be far more compact. Instead, the analysis shows that these young worlds must have changed dramatically early on, quickly losing large portions of their thick atmospheres as the surrounding disk of gas around their star disappeared.\n\n\"These planets have already undergone a dramatic transformation, rapidly losing much of their original atmospheres and cooling faster than what we'd expect from standard models,\" explains James Owen, a co-author from Imperial College London who led the theoretical modeling. \"But they're still evolving. Over the next few billion years, they will continue to lose their atmosphere and shrink significantly, transforming into the compact worlds we see throughout the galaxy.\"\n\nPetigura compared the system's importance to a famous fossil discovery. \"I'm reminded of the famous 'Lucy' fossil, one of our hominid ancestors that lived 3 million years ago and was one of the key 'missing links' between apes and humans,\" he said. \"V1298Tau is a critical link between the star/planet forming nebulae we see all over the sky, and the mature planetary systems that we have now discovered by the thousands.\"\n\nWhy Our Solar System Is Different\n\nToday, V1298 Tau stands out as a natural laboratory for studying how the most common planets in the Milky Way come into existence. Observations of this system provide rare insight into the chaotic and transformative early lives of planets and may help explain why our own solar system lacks the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that dominate elsewhere.\n\n\"This discovery fundamentally changes how we think about planetary systems,\" adds Livingston. \"V1298 Tau shows us that today's super-Earths and sub-Neptunes start out as giant, puffy worlds that contract over time. We're essentially watching the universe's most successful planetary architecture in the making.\"",
