      "summary": "Unlike movements in earlier decades, Argentina’s latest youth-led protests are increasingly organized digitally through platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Whatsapp, rather than through unions or political parties.",
      "content": "This article was written by activist Facundo Rodriguez as part of the Forus-led CADE Youth Voices for Digital Rights program and is published here under a partnership agreement with Global Voices.\n\nIn a global context where our rights to protest face increasing pressure, the Argentine experience in youth manifestations, at a time of Generation Z protests worldwide, offers a reading lens into how contemporary youth participation is organised and can emerge from “civic space darkness.”\n\nArgentina’s latest university protests began in 2024, the first year of Javier Milei’s government, and were sparked by austerity, inflation, and budget cuts to public higher education, which threatened the historic role of public universities as engines of social mobility. Over a year later, they are now merging with more recent mobilizations that reflect deeper generational concerns about gender justice, equal access to knowledge, social mobility, and the future of public institutions.\n\nUnlike movements in earlier decades, Argentina’s youth-led protests are increasingly organized digitally through platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and WhatsApp rather than through unions or political parties. The Marcha Federal Universitaria in April 2024 — replicated in October — spread rapidly through hashtags such as #MarchaFederalUniversitaria (#FederalUniversityMarches), coordinated by student groups and open networks nationwide.\n\nThe defense of public education has become central. This movement is driven by a generation aware of how underfunding public universities directly affects their access to quality higher education.\n\nIn recent mass marches defending universities, the factor of “organicity” was once again evident. Mass participation was not solely due to student or union organizations (“organic”), but also to tens of thousands of independent students, non-activists, who felt individually called to join. The organization of these protests combined street action with numerous social media initiatives (TikTok videos, X threads, graphic content) to raise awareness of the issue.\n\nOn September 17, 2025, tens of thousands marched in Buenos Aires demanding restoration of funding for public universities and pediatric health as part of broader protests against austerity measures targeting education and health. Social media posts and calls mobilized using slogans such as “Nuestro futuro no se veta” (“Our future can't be vetoed”), associated with the protest plan.\n\nRecent data from the EU SEE initiative points to a trend in which new generations mobilize through hybrid models where traditional and digital participation mechanisms coexist with decentralized, horizontal, and explosive forms of civic action.\n\nAt the same time, pressure on civic space, civil society organizations, polarization, and disinformation campaigns shape and mold participation. But no form of civic participation is static, and across the region we are seeing new modes of protest emerge: intergenerational coalitions, digitally mediated campaigns, and youth-led actions that combine online mobilization with street-level presence.\n\nGeneration Z, those born from the late 1990s to the early 2010s, now represents roughly one-quarter of Latin America’s population, or about 160 million young people — one out of every four Latin Americans. As digital natives, they have developed new forms of parasocial engagement online, sharing key concerns: the climate crisis, social, gender, and economic injustices, and heightened economic pressures.\n\nYouth protests in Argentina, particularly those of GenZ, operate under this model of action — a dual path where the streets and social media do not compete, but rather reinforce and amplify one another. While these movements inherit tactics from traditional activism, they reinterpret them with their own logic.\n\nUnlike mobilizations led by traditional actors, such as trade unions or political parties, which follow an inorganic, hierarchical, and planned structure, youth participation is often much less structured, more individual, and sparked by specific events that generate mass engagement. Still, these young actors also collaborate with traditional structures, which provide political and organizational support to the movements.\n\nThe ‘Green Tide’\n\nThe campaign for legal, safe and free abortion, under the movement of the Marea Verde (Green tide), around 2015 and 2020, is highly illustrative of this dynamic. Although there was central coordination through a national campaign, what ensured its success and mass appeal was a social dynamic that became autonomous and organic.\n\nThe Ni Una Menos (Not One Woman Less) movement in particular united millions to confront sexist, machista violence, since 2015. A tweet was turned into a slogan and a viral hashtag, spreading across social media and transforming into a mass movement. Gen Z and millennial activists not only amplified the message online, but also drove huge mobilizations offline. For many young Argentines, the movement was a defining entry point into feminism, inspiring their participation not only in anti-femicide marches but also in related campaigns such as the successful fight for reproductive rights. The movement became a phenomenon of cultural identity.\n\nThis wave operated simultaneously on two fronts. On the streets, through mass protests, “pañuelazos” (green scarf demonstrations), and vigils that displayed physical strength and territorial presence. And on social media, the green scarf became a symbol and a continual generator of content, educating, pressuring representatives, and shaping the media agenda.\n\nThe same digitally driven dynamic has shaped other intergenerational and intersectional protests. In October 2025, thousands gathered in Buenos Aires demanding justice for three young women whose torture and murders had been broadcast online. In both cases, Argentina’s young people are using the tools of their generation to transform online outrage into real-world collective action, rooted in connectivity and rapid mobilization.\n\nThe political context is decisive. The period 2015–2021 marked the height of the feminist struggle, which succeeded in generating public debate and securing reproductive rights, fighting against gender-based violence, and femicides at the centre of the national agenda. The current political period in Argentina has sought to curtail some of these discussions.\n\nMeanwhile, the legacy of the Mothers and Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo is still shaping today’s movements in the country. In the midst of the latest dictatorship (1976–1983), these women took to the streets to demand the safe return of their disappeared sons, daughters, and grandchildren — a cause that continues to this day.\n\nMilei’s government, however, has attempted to roll back aspects of the feminist agenda, reducing institutional support for gender policies, defunding programs, and questioning the legitimacy of feminist demands.\n\nThis has led to many other movements linked to economic, social, and environmental equality, and to a renewed urgency of state responsibility. Feminist movements are also active and seeking to regain momentum in this context.\n\nThe contextual shift\n\nThis logic of civic mobilization, though with its own characteristics, has precedents in other provinces and contexts. In Entre Ríos, protests to protect wetlands and rivers are a central feature of the public agenda, shaped particularly by the region’s geography, with its many freshwater channels and wetlands.\n\nAlthough not as large-scale or youth-led as the Green Wave, these movements share traits of self-convocation. They also build on a key historical precedent in the province: the massive resistance of the citizens of Gualeguaychú against the installation of the UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UMP) pulp mill (formerly Botnia), which demonstrated civil society’s capacity to organize sustainably outside traditional structures.\n\nThe greatest challenge of this hybrid model is the risk of purely symbolic or performative activism: the illusion that digital activism (posting a story, signing an online petition) is sufficient in itself, replacing collective action on the ground.\n\nYouth movements themselves show that the public and physical street remain central and irreplaceable. The LGBTQ+ Pride March, which mobilizes hundreds of thousands of people across Argentine provinces every November since 1992, in memory of the founding of Nuestro Mundo, the first LGBTQ+ organization in Latin America in 1967, is proof of this. While it could exist as a digital event, the physical gathering, the celebration of bodies in public space, and the demonstration of numbers remain irreplaceable political acts.\n\nThe future of GenZ mobilizations in Argentina does not appear to be purely digital or purely analog. It is this dual path: social networks to organize, raise awareness, and build identity; the streets to exert pressure, make collective strength visible, and materialize change.",

Watch the full debate here.\n\nRussia’s war against Ukraine / European defence and security\n\nIn response to Russia’s systematic use of energy supplies as a weapon, Parliament approved the agreement with Council to ban imports of Russian natural gas on 17 December. The ban will apply to spot-market liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the date the regulation enters into force in early 2026, and to pipeline gas from 30 September 2027. The text agreed also sets out the maximum penalties that member states must impose on operators who violate the regulation. During negotiations with the Danish presidency of the Council, MEPs pushed for a ban on all imports of Russian oil and secured a commitment by the European Commission to present legislation for this in early 2026 so that an effective ban can enter into force as soon as possible and no later than late-2027.\n\nOn 17 December, MEPs adopted a resolution on military mobility highlighting the urgent need to improve the rapid cross-border movement of troops, equipment and assets across Europe to withstand potential Russian aggression. Parliament is calling for the removal of internal borders for the movement of troops and military equipment across the EU, and for upgrades to railways, roads, tunnels and bridges. MEPs recommend working towards a “military Schengen area”, reinforced by a military mobility task force and a European coordinator to streamline implementation of the different initiatives, with the Commission providing a roadmap. In a report on “European Defence Readiness 2030: Assessment of Needs”, also adopted on 17 December, MEPs identify possible ways to strengthen financing tools and better mobilise private investment to support the European Union’s defence readiness. In a rapidly deteriorating security environment and with the EU facing hybrid and conventional threats, Parliament stresses the need for the EU to ramp up investment in defence readiness significantly.\n\nOn 16 December Parliament backed a request to fast-track its legislative processes on draft legislation on a loan for Ukraine. The proposal would introduce an EU reparations loan for Ukraine, underpinned by the European Commission borrowing against the profits and cash balances generated by immobilised Russian state assets. This new instrument, if adopted, would support Ukraine’s financial needs and state budget, including military capabilities, as well as the country’s defence industry and its integration into the European defence industrial base. The proposed loan is linked to the existing Ukraine Facility and Ukraine Loan Cooperation Mechanism.\n\nTo strengthen Europe’s defence technological and industrial base, on 16 December plenary approved an agreement with Council on increasing funding for defence-related investment. This will be achieved by amending existing EU programmes - the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP), Horizon Europe, the European Defence Fund (EDF), the Digital Europe programme (DEP) and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) - to channel EU funding towards defence.\n\nOn 16 December, MEPs and the Commission debated the continuing Belarusian hybrid attacks on Lithuania. A resolution will be put to a vote on 18 December. The draft text points to Belarus’ repeated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and balloon incursions into Lithuanian airspace, as well as cyberattacks, state-sponsored disinformation campaigns, economic coercion, and instrumentalised migration. These actions, the draft says, are deliberate, coordinated, hostile and also part of a broader Russia-led strategy to undermine the EU, its member states and NATO. Watch the debate.\n\nOn 15 December, MEPs from four committees approved new proposals to accelerate defence investment and improve the EU’s responsiveness in the face of security challenges. The set of legislative files, part of the “Omnibus V” package of EU simplification measures, are designed to speed up the approval of permits for defence projects and the export of defence equipment between EU countries, simplify security and defence procurement and EU cooperation on defence contracts, ensure that EU chemical regulations accommodate defence needs, and simplify the implementation of the European Defence Fund. These proposals also aim to facilitate up to €800 billion in defence investment over the next four years under the ReArm Europe Plan/Readiness 2030, allowing member states and the defence industry to react more effectively in response to escalating security challenges\n\nOn 2 December, the Foreign Affairs Committee adopted a report stressing that, while the transatlantic partnership remains the backbone of the world’s democratic community and a pillar of the liberal international order, the EU must strengthen its strategic autonomy to stay resilient amid shifts in US foreign policy. MEPs underline that cooperation should prioritise trade, security and defence, technology, energy and new geopolitical threats, alongside the rule of law, societal resilience and environmental protection.\n\nIn a resolution adopted on 27 November, Parliament urged the EU to show leadership at this crucial geopolitical moment and to continue working with the US and other like-minded partners to ensure that negotiations for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine uphold the principles of international law. MEPs reiterated that “nothing about Ukraine should be decided without Ukraine, and nothing about Europe without Europe”, and criticised the US administration’s ambivalence toward the country.\n\nOn 25 November, Parliament adopted a law to establish the EU’s first-ever European defence industry programme (EDIP). The scheme seeks to strengthen the EU defence industry, foster joint procurement, extend manufacturing capacity and increase support for Ukraine. The €1.5 billion EDIP budget includes €300 million for the Ukraine Support Instrument and sets up the new FAST fund of at least €150 million to strengthen the defence supply chain. During negotiations, MEPs secured additional funding via the SAFE instrument, and the programme also enables member states to redirect unspent Recovery and Resilience Facility funds to support EDIP projects.\n\nFurther reading\n\nParliament to fast-track the reparations loan for Ukraine\n\nEU to phase out imports of Russian gas\n\nMEPs back “military Schengen” to help withstand potential Russian aggression\n\nMEPs back new measures to strengthen Europe’s defence readiness\n\nParliament backs measures to boost EU support for defence investments\n\nDefence: MEPs call on European allies to build a strong pillar inside NATO\n\nParliament greenlights first-ever European defence industry programme\n\nEU must show leadership in achieving peace in Ukraine\n\nMEPs demand a unified EU response to Russian violations and hybrid warfare threats\n\nEU-US relations: MEPs call for deepened transatlantic cooperation beneficial for both sides\n\nMEPs demand an assertive foreign policy that defends the EU’s interests\n\n\n\nGeoeconomic situation and EU competitiveness\n\nOn 16 December, MEPs approved new EU rules on sustainability reporting and due diligence obligations for companies. Social and environmental reporting will apply only to EU companies with more than 1,000 employees and an annual net turnover exceeding €450 million, as well as to non-EU companies generating the same turnover within the EU. For due diligence, the requirements will be limited to very large EU companies with over 5,000 employees and a net annual turnover above €1.5 billion. The same rules will apply to non-EU companies with an equivalent turnover in the EU.\n\nTo prevent imports from Mercosur countries harming Europe’s agriculture sector, MEPs approved a safeguard clause for the EU-Mercosur agreement on 16 December. Negotiations with the Council on the final form of the legislation started on 17 December and were concluded the same evening. The draft regulation sets out how the Commission could decide to temporarily suspend tariff preferences on the import of certain agricultural products considered sensitive (such as poultry or beef, eggs, citrus and sugar) from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay if these imports are seen to be harming EU producers.\n\nOn 17 December, Parliament gave its greenlight to new EU deforestation rules, agreed between Parliament and Council on 4 December. The application of the EU Deforestation Regulation will be postponed by one year for all businesses. The new law also introduces targeted adjustments to help companies, global stakeholders and member states implement the legislation more effectively.\n\nOn 16 December, MEPs adopted new rules on further flexibility and support for farmers in complying with the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP). Farmers will enjoy more flexibility for keeping land in good agricultural and environmental condition. Inspections will take place according to the “once only” principle, so farmers will not have to undergo more than one official on-the-spot check in any given year. Co-legislators also agreed to increase financial support for small scale farmers.\n\nThese agreements form part of the Omnibus I simplification package proposed by the European Commission on 26 February 2025. MEPs have repeatedly pushed for a revision of EU rules to simplify and reduce administrative requirements for businesses. The Commission’s “omnibus” package seeks to boost competitiveness and investment capacity for businesses. As a matter of urgency, Parliament has already adopted several proposals and is making swift progress to finalise the remaining ones. Addressing the informal leaders’ meeting in Copenhagen on 1 October, President Metsola reaffirmed Parliament’s commitment to the simplification agenda, emphasising that it “will mean more jobs, more stability and ultimately, more security.”\n\nMEPs and the Council reached a provisional agreement updating EU rules on the screening of foreign investments to prevent security risks, on 11 December. Under the new rules foreign investments in sensitive sectors such as defence, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, critical raw materials and financial services will be subject to mandatory screening by member states, in order to identify and address potential security or public order risks.\n\nOn 11 December, the Legal Affairs Committee came forward with a series of recommendations for an upcoming Commission proposal on a new legal framework to support innovative companies, known as the “28th corporate regime”. According to MEPs, to boost cross-border mobility, investment and innovation, the EU needs harmonised rules tailored to SMEs, including startups and scaleups, aligning EU company law with the dynamic needs of modern businesses.\n\nOn 26 November, MEPs approved a proposal to simplify InvestEU programme reporting requirements and expand its financial capacity to address rising funding challenges. InvestEU is the EU’s main instrument for attracting public and private investment. The proposal is part of the Omnibus II package, which seeks to simplify EU rules, boost competitiveness, and enhance investment capacity. The changes will reinforce the InvestEU programme with a €2.9 billion increase in the EU guarantee. This additional guarantee will enable more financial support to be channelled, for instance, into housing, modern transport infrastructure, clean energy technologies, and skills development.\n\nFurther reading\n\nMercosur: Parliament and Council agree on agriculture safeguards\n\nMercosur: Parliament backs safeguard measures to protect EU agriculture\n\nSimplified sustainability reporting and due diligence rules for businesses\n\nDeforestation law: Parliament adopts changes to postpone and simplify measures\n\nParliament endorses simpler rules and more support for farmers\n\nAgreement on enhanced tools to protect EU strategic sectors from risky foreign investments\n\nInvestEU: final vote to increase financial capacity and simplify rules\n\nMEPs’ recommendations for a new EU framework for innovative companies\n\n\n\nMigration\n\nOn 17 December, MEPs approved the negotiation mandate for talks with Council on changes to the EU’s 2024 Asylum Law regarding the criteria for designating safe non-EU countries. Negotiations started on 17 December in Strasbourg and were concluded on 18 December. Co-legislators agreed on the new rules under which member states may decide that a non-EU country is a safe third country (STC) with respect to an asylum applicant who is not a national of that country, and may therefore declare their application inadmissible. The new rules would allow EU countries to apply the STC concept in individual cases where one of these three conditions is met: there is a connection between the applicant and a third country; applicants have transited through a third country on the way to the EU; or an agreement or arrangement exists with a third country at a bilateral, multilateral or EU level for the admission of asylum seekers. The deal builds on a proposal by the Commission to update this provision in the Asylum Procedure Regulation. MEPs also approved the mandate for talks on an EU-wide list of safe countries of origin. On 3 December, the Civil Liberties Committee endorsed the designation of an EU-wide list, in line with the Commission proposal. The list would include: Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Kosovo, India, Morocco and Tunisia. EU accession candidate countries are also considered safe countries of origin, unless specific circumstances indicate otherwise, e.g. indiscriminate violence in the context of an armed conflict. Negotiations started on 17 December in Strasbourg.\n\nFurther reading\n\nAsylum: EP and Council reach a deal to update safe third country rules\n\nMEPs support review of criteria to declare a third country safe for asylum applicants\n\nAsylum policy: MEPs back first EU list of safe countries of origin\n\nEU Talent Pool: deal on facilitating international recruitment in shortage occupations\n\nMore flexible visa suspension mechanism\n\nReinforced Europol mandate for fight against migrant smuggling\n\nNext multiannual financial framework\n\nOn 11 December, Parliament’s Budgets Committee presented its draft interim report for the 2028–2034 multiannual financial framework (MFF). The report will set out Parliament’s position for upcoming talks with member states, including proposed funding levels for each EU policy and programme. It calls for a significantly strengthened MFF. The co-rapporteurs Siegfried Mureşan (EPP, RO) and Carla Tavares (S&D, PT) claim this will address the EU’s intensifying geopolitical, economic, social, and environmental challenges. Parliament is expected to vote on the report in plenary in May 2026.\n\nOn 7 May 2025, Parliament adopted a resolution outlining its demands for the 2028–2034 budget. MEPs call for a significantly more ambitious multiannual financial framework (MFF) that can deliver on EU citizens’ rising expectations amid global instability, arguing that the current spending ceiling of 1% of the EU-27’s gross national income is not enough.\n\nFurther reading\n\nPress conference: lead MEPs brief the public on EU’s long-term budget\n\nParliament’s priorities for the EU’s post-2027 long-term budget\n\nParliament's draft report on the long-term EU budget\n\nRecording of the presentation of the draft report in the Budgets Committee (19.2.2025.)\n\nRecording of a press conference by the MFF co-rapporteurs (18.12.2024.)\n\nEPRS briefing: Future of EU long-term financing (February 2025)\n\nPress release: \"Own Resources\": Parliament's position on new EU revenue\n\nAll you need to know about the EU’s long-term budget\n\nMiddle East\n\nOn 16 December, MEPs discussed recent developments in Palestine and Lebanon with Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Šuica. The debate centred around ongoing violence in Palestine, recent Israeli air attacks on alleged Hezbollah sites in Lebanon, and the prospects of achieving a two-state solution. Watch the debate.\n\nIn a debate on 21 October, MEPs and Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Šuica discussed the recent Middle East peace agreement and the role of the EU. On 13 October, EP President Roberta Metsola welcomed the peace deal for Gaza and said the EU stands ready to help ensure its implementation.\n\nIn a resolution adopted on 11 September 2025, MEPs stated that the creation of a Palestinian state is key to peace, Israel’s security, and regional normalisation. MEPs strongly condemned Israel’s aid blockade and urged all EU institutions and member states to take diplomatic steps to ensure a commitment to a two-state solution. Parliament also called for Gaza’s total demilitarisation, the release of all hostages, Hamas’s exclusion from governance, and full investigations into all war crimes and violations of international law.\n\nFurther reading\n\nParliament pushes for Gaza aid, the hostages’ release and justice\n\nGaza at breaking point: EU action to combat famine, the urgent need to release hostages and move towards a two-state solution\n\nEnlargement\n\nOn 22 October, Parliament adopted a resolution on the institutional implications of the EU’s enlargement negotiations. It emphasises that Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and other geopolitical challenges heighten the need to accelerate the enlargement process. The resolution also stresses that the post-2027 MFF and a more efficient budget, including the new own-resources package, must equip the EU to move decisively towards enlargement while safeguarding existing policies, programmes and priorities. The report highlights the need to address the problems stemming from unanimity voting in the Council, including its use for intermediate steps in the accession process, allowing bilateral disputes to delay candidate countries’ progress.",

The meeting is the most important opportunity of the year to reaffirm the strategic partnership between the European Union and the Western Balkans, the Declaration states.\n\nThe document reaffirms the full and unequivocal commitment to the Western Balkans’ perspective of membership in the European Union.\n\n– The future of the Western Balkans is in our Union. Enlargement represents a real opportunity that must be seized. We welcome the new momentum and the progress achieved since the last meeting. Accelerating the accession process, based on credible reforms by the partners, fair and rigorous conditionality and on the principle of own merits, is in our mutual interest. Enlargement is a geostrategic investment in peace, security, stability and prosperity, as stated in the Granada Declaration. The urgency of our time requires a sustainable momentum. The countries aspiring to membership should accelerate their reform activities. In parallel, the Union should strengthen its internal foundations and reforms, it is emphasized in the “Brussels Declaration”.\n\nEU–Western Balkans Summit in Brussels, 17 December 2025, Photo: European Council\n\nThe document stresses that inclusive regional cooperation, reconciliation and good-neighbourly relations remain key to building a common future, as well as to implementing international agreements in good faith and with tangible results, including the Prespa Agreement with Greece and the Treaty of Friendship, Good-Neighbourliness and Cooperation with Bulgaria.\n\n– Determined further efforts are still needed to foster reconciliation and regional stability, as well as to find and implement definitive, inclusive and binding solutions to the partners’ regional and bilateral disputes and issues, rooted in the legacy of the past, and in accordance with international law and established principles, including the Agreement on Succession Issues, as well as the remaining cases of missing persons and issues related to war crimes, the text adds.\n\nThe Declaration underlines that the EU welcomes the commitment of the Western Balkans partners to uphold European values and principles in accordance with international law, the primacy of democracy, fundamental rights and values and the rule of law, and expects them to demonstrate this in words and deeds, by taking responsibility and implementing the necessary reforms, especially in the area of fundamental principles.\n\n– Freedom of expression, independent and pluralistic media, gender equality and the strong role of civil society are key to ensuring a functioning democracy. The EU calls on the partners to guarantee the rights of persons belonging to minorities and their equal treatment, the document states. (17 December 2025)",
