      "title": "A hidden T cell switch could make cancer immunotherapy work for more people",
      "summary": "Scientists have discovered that T cell receptors activate through a hidden spring-like motion that had never been seen before. This breakthrough may help explain why immunotherapy works for some cancers and how it could be improved for others.",
      "content": "Over the past ten years, T cell immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most promising developments in cancer treatment. These therapies work by training a patient's own immune system to detect and destroy dangerous cells. Despite their success, scientists have struggled to fully explain how these treatments function at a molecular level. This lack of understanding has slowed progress, especially since T cell therapies work well for only a small number of cancer types and fail in most others, for reasons that have remained unclear. Gaining insight into their modus operandi could help make these therapies effective for far more patients.\n\nScientists at The Rockefeller University have now uncovered crucial details about the T cell receptor (TCR), a protein complex embedded in the cell membrane that plays a central role in T cell therapies. Using cryo-EM, researchers from the Laboratory of Molecular Electron Microscopy studied the receptor in a biochemical setting designed to closely resemble its native milieu. They discovered that the TCR behaves like a jack-in-the-box, staying compact until it encounters an antigen or another suspicious particle, at which point it rapidly opens. This behavior contradicts what earlier cryo-EM studies of the receptor had shown.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature Communications, could help researchers improve and expand the use of T cell immunotherapies.\n\n\"This new fundamental understanding of how the signaling system works may help re-engineer that next generation of treatments,\" says first author Ryan Notti, an instructor in clinical investigation in Walz's lab and a special fellow in the Department of Medicine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where he treats patients with sarcomas, or cancers that arise in soft tissue or bone.\n\n\"The T cell receptor is really the basis of virtually all oncological immunotherapies, so it's remarkable that we use the system but really have had no idea how it actually works -- and that's where basic science steps in,\" says Walz, a world expert in cryo-EM imaging. \"This is some of the most important work to ever come out of my lab.\"\n\nHow T Cells Detect Threats\n\nWalz's lab focuses on producing detailed images of macromolecular complexes, especially proteins found in cell membranes that help cells communicate with their surroundings. The TCR is one such complex. Made up of multiple proteins, it enables T cells to recognize antigens displayed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes on other cells. This recognition process is what T cell therapies rely on to mobilize the immune system against cancer.\n\nAlthough scientists have known the individual parts of the TCR for many years, the earliest steps that trigger its activation have remained elusive. Notti, who works as both a physician and a researcher, found this gap especially troubling because many of his sarcoma patients were not benefiting from T cell immunotherapies.\n\n\"Determining that would help us understand how the information gets from outside the cell, where those antigens are being presented by HLAs, to the inside of the cell, where signaling turns on the T cell,\" he says.\n\nNotti earned his Ph.D. in structural microbiology at Rockefeller before moving into oncology, and he suggested to Walz that they investigate this unanswered question together.\n\nRebuilding the TCR's Natural Environment\n\nWalz's team is known for creating custom membrane environments that closely mimic the natural surroundings of membrane proteins. \"We can change the biochemical composition, the thickness of the membrane, the tension and curvature, the size -- all kinds of parameters that we know have an influence on the embedded protein,\" Walz says.\n\nFor this study, the researchers set out to observe the TCR in conditions that closely resemble those inside a living cell. They placed the receptor into a nanodisc, a tiny disc-shaped section of membrane held in solution by a scaffold protein wrapped around its edge. Assembling the full receptor was difficult, and \"getting all eight of these proteins properly assembled into the nanodisc was challenging,\" Notti says.\n\nPrevious structural studies of the TCR had relied on detergent, which often strips away the surrounding membrane. Walz notes that this was the first time the receptor complex had been restored to a membrane environment for detailed imaging.\n\nSeeing the Receptor Switch On\n\nOnce the TCR was embedded in the nanodisc, the researchers used cryo-EM to visualize it. The images showed that the receptor remains closed and compact when inactive. When it encounters an antigen-presenting molecule, however, the structure opens and extends outward, resembling a wide-reaching motion.\n\nThe result surprised the team. \"The data that were available when we began this research depicted this complex as being open and extended in its dormant state,\" Notti explains. \"As far as anyone knew, the T cell receptor didn't undergo any conformational changes when binding to these antigens. But we found that it does, springing open like a sort of jack-in-the-box.\"\n\nThe researchers believe two factors made this discovery possible. First, they carefully recreated the TCR's in vivo membrane environment using the right lipid mixture. Second, they reinserted the receptor into a membrane using nanodiscs before conducting cryo-EM imaging. They found that an intact membrane keeps the receptor in a closed position until activation occurs. In earlier studies, detergent may have removed this restraint, allowing the receptor to open prematurely.\n\n\"It was important that we used a lipid mixture that resembled that of the native T cell membrane,\" says Walz. \"If we had just used a model lipid, we wouldn't have seen this closed dormant state either.\"\n\nImplications for Cancer Therapies and Vaccines\n\nThe team believes their findings could help improve treatments that rely on T cell receptors. \"Re-engineering the next generation of immunotherapies tops the charts in terms of unmet clinical needs,\" Notti says. \"For example, adoptive T cell therapies are being used successfully to treat certain very rare sarcomas, so one could imagine using our insights to re-engineer the sensitivity of those receptors by tuning their activation threshold.\"\n\nWalz also sees potential applications beyond cancer therapy. \"This information may be used for vaccine design as well,\" he adds. \"People in the field can now use our structures to see refined details about the interactions between different antigens presented by HLA and T cell receptors. Those different modes of interaction might have some implication for how the receptor functions -- and ways to optimize it.\"",

      "summary": "Researchers have identified a previously overlooked protein that helps regulate appetite and energy use in the body. This “helper” protein supports a key system that decides whether the body burns energy or stores it, and when it does not function properly, appetite signals can weaken.",
      "content": "New research suggests that a protein the body relies on to manage appetite and energy levels cannot function on its own. Instead, it depends on a partner protein to work properly. This discovery could help scientists better understand how genetic factors contribute to obesity.\n\nIn a study published in Science Signaling on December 16, an international research team led by scientists at the University of Birmingham examined how a helper protein known as MRAP2 supports an appetite regulating protein called MC3R. MC3R plays a key role in deciding whether the body stores energy or uses it.\n\nBuilding on earlier hunger research\n\nPrevious studies had already shown that MRAP2 is essential for the activity of a related protein (MC4R), which is known to control hunger. The new research set out to determine whether MRAP2 provides the same kind of support for the closely related protein MC4R.\n\nTo explore this question, the researchers used cell models to observe how the proteins interact. They found that when MRAP2 was present in equal amounts with MC3R, cellular signaling became stronger. This result suggests that MRAP2 helps MC3R do its job of balancing energy intake with energy use. The team also identified specific regions of MRAP2 that are required for supporting signaling through both MC3R and MC4R.\n\nHow genetic mutations weaken appetite signals\n\nThe researchers then investigated what happens when MRAP2 carries genetic mutations that have been identified in some people with obesity. In these experiments, mutated versions of the supporter protein (MRAP2) failed to boost MC3R signaling. As a result, the appetite regulating protein did not respond as effectively.\n\nThese findings indicate that changes in MRAP2 can interfere with the hormone system that normally helps maintain energy balance. When this system does not work as intended, appetite regulation may be disrupted.\n\nNew clues for obesity risk and future treatments\n\nDr. Caroline Gorvin, Associate Professor at the University of Birmingham and lead author of the study, said: \"The findings give us some important insights into what's going on in the hormonal system, related to some key functions like energy balance, appetite, and puberty timing.\n\n\"The identification of this protein, MRAP2, as a key aide or supporter to these essential appetite-regulating proteins also gives us new clues for people who have a genetic predisposition to obesity, and how MRAP2 mutations are a clear indication of risk.\"\n\nBy learning more about how MRAP2 supports appetite related signaling, researchers hope to determine whether future drugs could target this protein. Such treatments might strengthen feelings of fullness, reduce overeating, and improve the body's overall energy balance, offering new options for weight loss when dieting alone is not effective.\n\nA collaborative effort in metabolism and cell signaling research\n\nThe research was carried out by a team from the Department of Metabolism and Systems Science and the Centre of Membrane Proteins and Receptors (COMPARE). COMPARE is a cross-University Research Centre involving the Universities of Birmingham and Nottingham, focused on studying how cells communicate in both health and disease. Its goal is to develop new therapies for widespread conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – G proteins are important molecules in our bodies that help cells communicate and respond to signals. Scientists have studied them for many years, especially since their discovery won a Nobel Prize. These proteins are involved in how pain medicines like opioids work.\n\n**What happened** – In December 2025, researchers published new studies showing surprising ways that G proteins send signals inside cells. These findings explain how opioids could be designed differently to work better. The research was shared in two scientific papers by Stahl and colleagues, revealing new details about G protein behavior that were not known before.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it could help create opioid drugs that relieve pain more effectively and for a longer time. At the same time, these new drugs might cause fewer side effects than current opioids, which often lead to problems like addiction or drowsiness. Better pain medicines would improve life for many people who suffer from chronic or severe pain.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will now use this new knowledge to develop and test new opioid drugs based on the updated understanding of G protein signaling. This could lead to safer and stronger pain relief options becoming available in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New insights into G proteins open the door to better opioids that could relieve pain more effectively with fewer side effects.",
