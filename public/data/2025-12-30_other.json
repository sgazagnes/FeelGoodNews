      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn a year marked by rapid change, scientific progress gave us reasons to wonder, dream, and keep pushing forward. For our Best of 2025 Science roundup, we’re celebrating the breakthroughs that didn’t just advance human knowledge; they sparked possibility, opened new frontiers, and reminded us why curiosity is a superpower.\n\nDolphins have long fascinated scientists for their intelligence, empathy, and complex social behaviors. Now, researchers believe they may be on the verge of decoding a more intricate piece of dolphin communication: a system that bears resemblance to human language.\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), along with partner institutions like the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program (SDRP), have found the first potential evidence that bottlenose dolphins might use shared, word-like sounds known as non-signature whistles (NSWs).\n\n“Bottlenose dolphins have long fascinated animal communication researchers,” said Dr. Laela Sayigh, the study’s lead researcher at WHOI. “Our work shows that these whistles could potentially function like words, shared by multiple dolphins.”\n\nBeyond names: decoding the non-signature whistle\n\nMuch of past research on dolphin communication has centered around “signature whistles” (SWs), distinctive sounds used by individual dolphins as personal identifiers, similar to names. But NSWs, which make up about half of dolphin vocalizations, have remained largely understudied.\n\nThanks to a 50-year acoustic archive built by the SDRP in Sarasota, Florida, researchers were able to analyze the rarely examined NSWs. In their work, the team catalogued 22 distinct NSW types, including two whistles they labeled NSWA and NSWB, which are produced by at least 25 and 35 dolphins, respectively.\n\nThese shared whistles, unlike the individualistic SWs, are stereotyped; they repeat patterns that could serve as universal signals within the dolphin community.\n\nA new whistle, a possible meaning\n\nTo study the function of these sounds, the team used underwater digital tags and suction-cup hydrophones to capture vocalizations from identified dolphins. They then conducted playback experiments in the wild to observe dolphin responses.\n\n“We found that [NSWA] typically elicits avoidance responses, leading us to believe that it may have an alarm-type function,” Sayigh explained. The other call, NSWB, appears to function more like a query. “This whistle may be produced in response to an unexpected stimulus, perhaps as a way of inquiring what it is,” she said.\n\nSayigh emphasized that these interpretations are still hypotheses, noting that dolphins’ reactions to NSWB have been mixed. “Responses to playbacks of NSWB have been variable, which could support a variety of functions, including our suggested function as a query.”\n\nAre dolphins using a form of language?\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant. Since dolphins are known for lifelong vocal learning, a rare trait among mammals, and use referential SWs, the researchers believe it’s plausible that NSWs are also learned and convey meaning.\n\n“Our study provides the first evidence in dolphins for a wider repertoire of shared, context-specific signals, which could form the basis for a language-like communication system,” the study authors wrote.\n\nStill, Sayigh is cautious. “We have only suggested that NSWs may be word-like, in the sense that they may have specific meanings that are understood by multiple animals,” she said. More research is needed to determine whether dolphins truly use language-like structures.\n\nGlobal recognition for pioneering work\n\nThe study has earned the research team the inaugural Coller Dolittle Challenge prize. Jeremy Coller, the challenge’s founder, praised the team for helping bridge the communication gap between humans and animals. “Humans share this planet with millions of other species, but for far too long we’ve only talked among ourselves,” he said.\n\nThe researchers hope to use artificial intelligence to further analyze their extensive dataset and deepen our understanding of dolphin communication.\n\nAs Sayigh put it, “We don’t want to leave any patient behind, no matter how small they are.” Her sentiment reflects a growing scientific curiosity and ethical imperative to listen more closely to the creatures with whom we share the oceans.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Dolphins are known for their intelligence and social skills. Scientists have studied their unique sounds called \"signature whistles\" that work like names. But many other dolphin sounds have not been well understood.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program studied a type of dolphin sound called non-signature whistles (NSWs). Using 50 years of recorded dolphin sounds and underwater microphones, they found 22 types of NSWs shared by many dolphins. Two of these whistles seem to have special meanings: one may warn others to stay away, and another might be a question about something unusual.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time scientists have found evidence that dolphins might use a set of shared sounds that act like words, not just names. This could mean dolphins have a more complex way to communicate, similar to a language. It helps us better understand dolphin intelligence and social life.\n\n**What's next step** – The research team plans to use artificial intelligence to study dolphin sounds more deeply. They want to learn if these whistles have clear meanings and if dolphins really use them like words in a language.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have discovered that dolphins may use shared, word-like sounds to communicate, opening a new chapter in understanding how animals talk.\n\n",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 29 December 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04104-2Encouraging academics to act as advisers to outside organizations is the most effective way to serve society’s needs.",
      "content": "Universities have three core missions: research, teaching and societal impact. The third is increasingly defined in commercial terms. The number of intellectual property licences has increased and more spin-out companies are being formed. This shift is supported by an independent review of spin-out practices1, standardized investment guidance2 and the professionalization of university technology-transfer offices3.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nBy contrast, academic consulting work, one of the most direct and scalable means by which academics can shape industry, government and civil society, remains underdeveloped (see ‘Consulting gap’).\n\nConsulting work and other routes for exchanging knowledge are often treated as administrative functions. Such activities are defined and measured inconsistently and receive limited recognition in evaluations of research-related innovation. At a time when universities are struggling financially and academic research is often seen as distant from people’s everyday concerns, that must change.\n\nHere, we call for universities to make it easier for academics to carry out consulting work. If the work is properly supported, it can diversify income, build enduring partnerships and ensure that research delivers a tangible impact.\n\nWhy consulting work matters\n\nThere are widespread benefits to academics offering their advice to outside organizations for a fee. For higher-education institutions, consulting work can provide a flexible stream of income at a time of financial strain. It can foster partnerships with industry and government that generate collaborative research, joint ventures and fresh sources of funding.\n\nIt reinforces universities’ reputation as engines of applied knowledge and economic and societal impact. For example, one small software team at the University of Southampton, UK, turned open-source verification tools into more than £600,000 (US$799,000) of consulting income by advising on safety-critical railway systems between 2014 and 2021 (see go.nature.com/44ueoch).\n\nFor academics, consulting also offers professional development, wider networks, financial reward and real-world experience. It creates career porosity between academia, industry and policy, opening routes into leadership roles. For example, consulting can underpin the spin-out-company model: an academic who created intellectual property might be engaged as a ‘fractional executive’ through a consulting contract, allowing them to contribute to the company and develop leadership skills. Consulting work also enriches the research culture of higher-education institutions, giving academics direct feedback on how their work is used in practice, informing grant proposals and strengthening career progression.\n\nSources: Value of consulting market, Office for National Statistics; Academic consulting, IP and spin-out data, Higher Education Statistics Agency\n\nFor society, consulting accelerates the application of knowledge to national priorities, such as clean energy, health and social policy. It provides a mechanism for organizations to benefit from publicly funded research. It also ensures university expertise is applied beyond the campus walls, and can feed back into teaching with real-world case studies that better prepare graduates for the workforce.\n\nHigher-education institutions could embed modules that simulate the practice of consulting engagements to enhance students’ understanding of work. In one example, industry-led consulting projects were developed at Henley Business School, UK, to give master’s students hands-on experience.\n\nConsulting, therefore, is one of the most immediate channels through which universities can deliver societal impact. These projects are typically shorter in duration and easier to set up than other routes to impact, such as spin-out companies. Yet, across most institutions, consulting receives limited attention.\n\nLost opportunity\n\nUsing data from the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency on the number of consultancy contracts and academic staff at nine universities, we found that less than 10% of academic staff, on average, engaged in consulting work. Academic consulting is worth roughly £500–600 million per year (£566 million in 2023–24). That’s equivalent to 0.6% of the UK management consulting market value (£92 billion according to the Office for National Statistics), or 2.8% of the sector, based on the definition of the London-based Management Consultancies Association (£20.4 billion).\n\nOver the past decade, the number of academic consulting contracts has fallen by 38% from around 99,000 in 2014–15 to fewer than 62,000 in 2023–24. Higher average values of contracts have driven some growth, with the linear trend in total academic consultancy income rising by 31% from 2014–15 to 2023–24. But that falls short of the trend in the UK management consulting sector, which was 51% over that period.\n\nSome institutions have demonstrated what is possible. In 2023–24, 17 UK universities earned more than £10 million annually from consulting work across a vast range of disciplines and industries, including drug-development advice, advanced materials testing, digital health evaluation, engineering analysis, and policy and socio-economic consulting.\n\nMedical parasitology consultant Wellington Oyibo reports on anti-malaria strategies.Credit: Adekunle Ajayi/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nData are less available for institutions in other countries; limited information (including personal communications with US technology-transfer offices) suggests that consulting income typically does not make up a large share of institutional turnover. This suggests a global underutilization of academic expertise through consulting, even among the world’s most research-intensive universities — and a lost revenue stream for higher education. Management consulting alone in the United States was valued at $407 billion in 2025, according to market research firm IBIS World.\n\nPrivate consultancy firms are increasingly moving into this underexploited market, capturing opportunities that universities neglect. Small-scale (under £5,000), fast-turnaround, one-off projects are commonly sidelined by university contract offices because they represent too small an income for strained institutional resources, creating space for contract-research organizations and technical consultancies with the agility to capture this demand. If universities do not act, global professional services firms will continue to dominate the space in which academic insight could deliver direct societal benefit.\n\nPolicy patchwork\n\nWeak institutional policies on consulting are one reason for this missed opportunity. We examined policies at 30 universities hosting at least 5 UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellows — a 7-year fellowship programme designed to develop research and innovation leaders in academia and business — supplemented by surveys of 76 fellows and interviews with technology-transfer staff at the same universities. Our analysis reflects practices across a subset of research-intensive institutions, including our own, and is intended to inform sector-wide discussion rather than prescribe a single model.\n\nGreat science happens in great teams — research assessments must try to capture that\n\nThe results reveal a fragmented system. Two-thirds of the universities we surveyed have publicly available policies, two of which prohibit private consulting. Permitted university-contracted time for consulting ranges from unlimited to 30 days or fewer per year, or to personal time only. Institutional charges range from 10–40% of consulting fees.\n\nWhen we conducted interviews with staff who manage academic consulting services across multiple UK universities, administrative delays and inconsistent incentives or recognition of consulting were often cited as common issues. The result is a patchwork of practice, in which opportunities depend less on expertise and more on institutional flexibility.\n\nThe financial outcomes for academics vary widely, from flexible fees agreed between client and academic to university-set day rates. Some academics choose to put their consulting income into research accounts at their institution to support their group or department, but whether this is permitted, and on what terms, varies between universities and even across departments in the same institution. At some organizations, up to 50% of an individual’s earnings can be diverted into institutional research funds.\n\nServices to support academic consulting also differ between universities and within them, with some departments or technology-transfer offices providing insurance, contracting and negotiation support, and other institutions providing none. Contract approvals range from a 24-hour turnaround to months of negotiations. Faced with these obstacles, some academics turn to private consulting conducted outside their employment contracts, often without legal cover and sometimes in breach of institutional terms.",
