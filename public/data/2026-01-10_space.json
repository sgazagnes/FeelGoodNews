      "content": "When does the Nasa Moon mission launch and who are the Artemis II crew?\n\n9 hours ago Share Save Pallab Ghosh , Science Correspondent and Alison Francis Share Save\n\nNASA Artemis II Crew: left Christina Koch, back Victor Glover (pilot), front Reid Wiseman (commander), right Jeremy Hansen\n\nThe first crewed Moon mission in more than 50 years could be launched by Nasa as soon as the first week of February. The Artemis II mission, which will last about 10 days, could take its astronauts further into space than anyone has been before. It aims to set the stage for an eventual human landing on the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nWhen does Artemis II launch?\n\nNasa's planned launch window opens on 6 February and runs into the spring. The US space agency wants the rocket to blast off before the end of April. A date will not be set until final checks on its Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the Orion capsule - which carries the crew - and ground systems are completed. The mission will be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nWho are the Artemis II crew and what will they be doing?\n\nArtemis II's crew of four includes Nasa's commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover and mission specialist Christina Koch. A second mission specialist, Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency, will also be on board. The mission involves the first crewed flight of SLS and Orion. Once they are safely in orbit, the astronauts will test how the Orion spacecraft handles. This will involve manually flying the capsule in Earth orbit to practise steering and lining up the spacecraft for future Moon landings. They will then head out to a point thousands of kilometres beyond the Moon to check Orion's life‑support, propulsion, power and navigation systems. The crew will also act as medical test subjects, sending back data and imagery from deep space. They will work in a small cabin in weightlessness. Radiation levels will be higher than on the International Space Station, which is in low‑Earth orbit, but still safe. On return to Earth, the astronauts will experience a bumpy return through the atmosphere and a splashdown off the west coast of the US, in the Pacific.\n\nWill Artemis II land on the Moon?\n\nNo. This mission is to lay the ground for a lunar landing by astronauts in the Artemis III mission. Nasa says the launch of Artemis III will take place \"no earlier than\" 2027. However, experts believe 2028 is the earliest possible date. The final choice of a spacecraft to take the crew down to the lunar surface has not yet been made. It will either be SpaceX's Starship lander or a craft designed by Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. New spacesuits made by US company Axiom are also not ready. When Artemis III finally flies, the astronauts will be heading to the Moon's south pole. After this, the aim is to have a sustained human presence on the Moon. Artemis IV and V will begin building Gateway, a small space station circling the Moon. After that, there will be more Moon landings, extra sections added to Gateway, and new robotic rovers on the surface. More countries will be involved in keeping people living and working on and around the Moon for longer periods.\n\nWhen was the last Moon mission?\n\nThe last crewed Moon mission was Apollo 17, which landed in December 1972 and returned to Earth later that month. In all, 24 astronauts have travelled to the Moon and 12 of them have walked on its surface, all during the Apollo programme. America first went in the 1960s, primarily to beat the Soviet Union to assert its geopolitical and technological dominance. Once that goal was achieved, political enthusiasm and public interest ebbed, as did the money for future Moonshots. Artemis grew out of a desire to return humans to the Moon, this time for a longer-term presence built around new technology and commercial partnerships.\n\nDo other countries plan to send astronauts to the Moon?\n\nSeveral other countries have ambitions to put people on the Moon in the 2030s.​ European astronauts are set to join later Artemis missions and Japan has also secured seats. China is building its own craft, targeting a first landing near the Moon's south pole by 2030. Russia continues to talk about flying cosmonauts to the surface and building a small base sometime between about 2030 and 2035. Sanctions, funding pressures and technical setbacks mean its timetable is highly optimistic. India has also expressed ambitions to one day see its own astronauts walking on the Moon. Following the success of Chandrayaan 3's landing near the lunar south pole, India's space agency set out a goal of sending astronauts to the Moon by about 2040. This would be part of a push to move its human spaceflight programme beyond low Earth orbit.",

And the work to ensure that this first-of-its-kind project can fulfill its ambitious exploration vision is underway in some of the nation’s most advanced space simulation and testing laboratories.\n\nFrom left, Johns Hopkins APL engineers Tyler Radomsky and Felipe Ruiz install a rotor on the Dragonfly test model at the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Virginia. NASA\n\nSet for launch in in 2028, the Dragonfly rotorcraft is being designed and built at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, with contributions from organizations around the world. On arrival in 2034, Dragonfly will exploit Titan’s dense atmosphere and low gravity to fly to dozens of locations, exploring varied environments from organic equatorial dunes to an impact crater where liquid water and complex organic materials essential to life (at least as we know it) may have existed together.\n\nAerodynamic testing\n\nWhen full rotorcraft integration and testing begins in February, the team will tap into a trove of data gathered through critical technical trials conducted over the past three years, including, most recently, two campaigns at the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) facility at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.\n\nFrom left, Charles Pheng, Ryan Miller, John Kayrouz, Kristen Carey and Josie Ward prepare for the first aeromechanical performance tests of the full-scale Dragonfly rotors in the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Virginia. NASA\n\nThe TDT is a versatile 16-foot-high, 16-foot-wide, 20-foot-long testing hub that has hosted studies for NASA, the Department of War, the aircraft industry and an array of universities.\n\nOver five weeks, from August into September, the team evaluated the performance of Dragonfly’s rotor system – which provides the lift for the lander to fly and enables it to maneuver – in Titan-like conditions, looking at aeromechanical performance factors such as stress on the rotor arms, and effects of vibration on the rotor blades and lander body. In late December, the team also wrapped up a set of aerodynamics tests on smaller-scale Dragonfly rotor models in the TDT.\n\n“When Dragonfly enters the atmosphere at Titan and parachutes deploy after the heat shield does its job, the rotors are going to have to work perfectly the first time,” said Dave Piatak, branch chief for aeroelasticity at NASA Langley. “There’s no room for error, so any concerns with vehicle structural dynamics or aerodynamics need to be known now and tested on the ground. With the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel here at Langley, NASA offers just the right capability for the Dragonfly team to gather this critical data.”\n\nCritical parts\n\nIn his three years as an experimental machinist at APL, Cory Pennington has crafted parts for projects dispatched around the globe. But fashioning rotors for a drone to explore another world in our solar system? That was new – and a little daunting.\n\n“The rotors are some of the most important parts on Dragonfly,” Pennington said. “Without the rotors, it doesn’t fly – and it doesn’t meet its mission objectives at Titan.”\n\nExperimental machinist Cory Pennington examines a freshly milled, full-scale Dragonfly rotor in the machine shop at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nPennington and team cut Dragonfly’s first rotors on Nov. 1, 2024. They refined the process as they went: starting with waterjet paring of 1,000-pound aluminum blocks, followed by rough machining, cover fitting, vent-hole drilling and hole-threading. After an inspection, the parts were cleaned, sent out for welding and returned for final finishing.\n\n“We didn’t have time or materials to make test parts or extras, so every cut had to be right the first time,” Pennington said, adding that the team also had to find special tools and equipment to accommodate some material changes and design tweaks.\n\nThe team was able to deliver the parts a month early. Engineers set up and spin-tested the rotors at APL – attached to a full-scale model representing half of the Dragonfly lander – before transporting the entire package to the TDT at NASA Langley in late July.\n\n“On Titan, we’ll control the speeds of Dragonfly’s different rotors to induce forward flight, climbs, descents and turns,” said Felipe Ruiz, lead Dragonfly rotor engineer at APL.\n\n“It’s a complicated geometry going to a flight environment that we are still learning about. So the wind tunnel tests are one of the most important venues for us to demonstrate the design.”\n\nAnd the rotors passed the tests.\n\n“Not only did the tests validate the design team’s approach, we’ll use all that data to create high-fidelity representations of loads, forces and dynamics that help us predict Dragonfly’s performance on Titan with a high degree of confidence,” said Rick Heisler, wind tunnel test lead from APL.\n\nNext, the rotors will undergo fatigue and cryogenic trials under simulated Titan conditions, where the temperature is minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 178 degrees Celsius), before building the actual flight rotors.\n\n“We’re not just cutting metal — we’re fabricating something that’s going to another world,” Pennington said. “It’s incredible to know that what we build will fly on Titan.”\n\nCollaboration, innovation\n\nElizabeth “Zibi” Turtle, Dragonfly principal investigator at APL, says the latest work in the TDT demonstrates the mission’s innovation, ingenuity and collaboration across government and industry.\n\n“The team worked well together, under time pressure, to develop solutions, assess design decisions, and execute fabrication and testing,” she said. “There’s still much to do between now and our launch in 2028, but everyone who worked on this should take tremendous pride in these accomplishments that make it possible for Dragonfly to fly on Titan.”\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that\n\nsupports HTML5 video When NASA's Dragonfly begins full rotorcraft integration and testing in early 2026, the mission team will tap into a trove of data gathered through critical technical trials conducted over the past three years, including, most recently, a testing campaign in at the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) Facility at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nDragonfly has been a collaborative effort from the start. Kenneth Hibbard, mission systems engineer from APL, cites the vertical-lift expertise of Penn State University on the initial rotor design, aero-related modeling and analysis, and testing support in the TDT, as well as NASA Langley’s 14-by-22-foot Subsonic Tunnel. Sikorsky Aircraft of Connecticut has also supported aeromechanics and aerodynamics testing and analysis, as well as flight hardware modeling and simulation.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, leads the Dragonfly mission for NASA in collaboration with several NASA centers, industry partners, academic institutions and international space agencies. Elizabeth “Zibi” Turtle of APL is the principal investigator.

      "content": "A new NASA spacecraft called Pandora is awaiting launch ahead of its journey to study the atmospheres of exoplanets, or worlds beyond our solar system, and their stars.\n\nAlong for the ride are two shoebox-sized satellites called BlackCAT (Black Hole Coded Aperture Telescope) and SPARCS (Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat), as NASA innovates with ambitious science missions that take low-cost, creative approaches to answering questions like, “How does the universe work?” and “Are we alone?”\n\nAll three missions are set to launch Jan. 11 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The launch window opens at 8:19 a.m. EST (5:19 a.m. PST). SpaceX will livestream the event.\n\nArtist’s concept of NASA’s Pandora mission, which will help scientists untangle the signals from the atmospheres of exoplanets — worlds beyond our solar system — and their stars. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center/Conceptual Image Lab\n\n“Pandora’s goal is to disentangle the atmospheric signals of planets and stars using visible and near-infrared light,” said Elisa Quintana, Pandora’s principal investigator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “This information can help astronomers determine if detected elements and compounds are coming from the star or the planet — an important step as we search for signs of life in the cosmos.”\n\nBlackCAT and SPARCS are small satellites that will study the transient, high-energy universe and the activity of low-mass stars, respectively.\n\nPandora will observe planets as they pass in front of their stars as seen from our perspective, events called transits.\n\nAs starlight passes through a planet’s atmosphere, it interacts with substances like water and oxygen that absorb characteristic wavelengths, adding their chemical fingerprints to the signal.\n\nBut while only a small fraction of the star’s light grazes the planet, telescopes also collect the rest of the light emitted by the star’s facing side. Stellar surfaces can sport brighter and darker regions that grow, shrink, and change position over time, suppressing or magnifying signals from planetary atmospheres. Adding a further complication, some of these areas may contain the same chemicals that astronomers hope to find in the planet’s atmosphere, such as water vapor.\n\nAll these factors make it difficult to be certain that important detected molecules come from the planet alone.\n\nPandora will help address this problem by providing in-depth study of at least 20 exoplanets and their host stars during its initial year. The satellite will look at each planet and its star 10 times, with each observation lasting a total of 24 hours. Many of these worlds are among the over 6,000 discovered by missions like NASA’s TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite).\n\nThis view of the fully integrated Pandora spacecraft was taken May 19, 2025, following the mission’s successful environmental test campaign at Blue Canyon Technologies in Lafayette, Colorado. Visible are star trackers (center), multilayer insulation blankets (white), the end of the telescope (top), and the solar panel (right) in its launch configuration. NASA/BCT\n\nPandora will collect visible and near-infrared light using a novel, all-aluminum 17-inch-wide (45-centimeter) telescope jointly developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and Corning Incorporated in Keene, New Hampshire. Pandora’s near-infrared detector is a spare developed for NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nEach long observation period will capture a star’s light both before and during a transit and help determine how stellar surface features impact measurements.\n\n“These intense studies of individual systems are difficult to schedule on high-demand missions, like Webb,” said engineer Jordan Karburn, Pandora’s deputy project manager at Livermore. “You also need the simultaneous multiwavelength measurements to pick out the star’s signal from the planet’s. The long stares with both detectors are critical for tracing the exact origins of elements and compounds scientists consider indicators of potential habitability.”\n\nPandora is the first satellite to launch in the agency’s Astrophysics Pioneers program, which seeks to do compelling astrophysics at a lower cost while training the next generation of leaders in space science.\n\nAfter launching into low Earth orbit, Pandora will undergo a month of commissioning before embarking on its one-year prime mission. All the mission’s data will be publicly available.\n\n“The Pandora mission is a bold new chapter in exoplanet exploration,” said Daniel Apai, an astronomy and planetary science professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson where the mission’s operations center resides. “It is the first space telescope built specifically to study, in detail, starlight filtered through exoplanet atmospheres. Pandora’s data will help scientists interpret observations from past and current missions like NASA’s Kepler and Webb space telescopes. And it will guide future projects in their search for habitable worlds.”\n\nWatch to learn more about NASA’s Pandora mission, which will revolutionize the study of exoplanet atmospheres.\n\nNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThe BlackCAT and SPARCS missions will take off alongside Pandora through NASA’s Astrophysics CubeSat program, the latter supported by the Agency's CubeSat Launch Initiative.\n\nCubeSats are a class of nanosatellites that come in sizes that are multiples of a standard cube measuring 3.9 inches (10 centimeters) across. Both BlackCAT and SPARCS are 11.8 by 7.8 by 3.9 inches (30 by 20 by 10 centimeters). CubeSats are designed to provide cost-effective access to space to test new technologies and educate early career scientists and engineers while delivering compelling science.\n\nThe BlackCAT mission will use a wide-field telescope and a novel type of X-ray detector to study powerful cosmic explosions like gamma-ray bursts, particularly those from the early universe, and other fleeting cosmic events. It will join NASA’s network of missions that watch for these changes. Abe Falcone at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, where the satellite was designed and built, leads the mission with contributions from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Kongsberg NanoAvionics US provided the spacecraft bus.\n\nThe SPARCS CubeSat will monitor flares and other activity from low-mass stars using ultraviolet light to determine how they affect the space environment around orbiting planets. Evgenya Shkolnik at Arizona State University in Tempe leads the mission with participation from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. In addition to providing science support, JPL developed the ultraviolet detectors and the associated electronics. Blue Canyon Technologies fabricated the spacecraft bus.\n\nPandora is led by NASA Goddard. Livermore provides the mission’s project management and engineering. Pandora’s telescope was manufactured by Corning and developed collaboratively with Livermore, which also developed the imaging detector assemblies, the mission’s control electronics, and all supporting thermal and mechanical subsystems. The near-infrared sensor was provided by NASA Goddard. Blue Canyon Technologies provided the bus and performed spacecraft assembly, integration, and environmental testing. NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley will perform the mission’s data processing. Pandora’s mission operations center is located at the University of Arizona, and a host of additional universities support the science team.\n\nBy Jeanette Kazmierczak\n\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nClaire Andreoli\n\n301-286-1940\n\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.",

      "content": "A standard industrial knitting machine has been modified to produce fabrics from tungsten wire coated in gold, which are used to form the dish on the CarbSAR satellite\n\nAn artist’s impression of CarbSAR orbiting Earth Oxford Space Systems\n\nA new UK satellite is about to launch, wearing the latest in high‑tech knitwear. Called CarbSAR, it is due to go into orbit on Sunday, where it will deploy a mesh radar antenna produced on a machine more commonly found in a textiles factory.\n\n“It’s a very standard, off‑the‑shelf industrial machine used for knitting jumpers. All we’ve done is add some bells and whistles to let it stitch our special yarns,” says Amool Raina, production lead at Oxford Space Systems (OSS) in the UK.\n\nThe company has partnered with another UK-based firm, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL), to mount the antenna onto a small, inexpensive spacecraft capable of capturing high‑resolution images of Earth’s surface.\n\nIf it performs as expected, a similar novel design will be adopted for a network of surveillance satellites for the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) later this decade.\n\nThe “wool” in OSS’s knitting process is an ultra‑fine tungsten wire coated in gold. The company’s machine turns out metres of fabric at a time. These mesh sheets can be cut into pizza slice-shaped pieces and sewn together to form a 3-millimetre-wide disc that, when stretched tightly over 48 carbon‑fibre ribs, becomes a smooth parabolic dish ideal for radar imaging.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nA key innovation lies in the way each rib is wound radially around a central hub for launch, like 48 coiled builder’s tape measures. They allow the entire structure to collapse to a diameter of just 75 cm. This wrapped‑rib design dramatically reduces the volume the 140-kilogram CarbSAR satellite would otherwise occupy at the top of its rocket.\n\nOnce released into orbit, the strain energy stored in the bent carbon fibre drives the ribs to snap back into a straightened configuration, pulling the mesh into place to form the parabolic dish.\n\n“But for the imaging we want to do, we also need to unfurl with precision – to get that perfect parabolic shape,” says Sean Sutcliffe, OSS’s chief executive. “And that’s the beauty of our design.” Testing shows that, across the antenna, the mesh sheets remain within a millimetre of the ideal shape.\n\nEarth observation with small radar satellites is booming. The technology’s ability to image the ground in all weather conditions, and even at night, has been championed by a slew of new space companies.\n\nTheir data has found particular favour with militaries around the world and has played a major intelligence role in the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nBut despite leading the development of space radar in Europe in the 1990s, the UK has largely been left behind by international competition.\n\nCarbSAR, and a future MoD constellation called Oberon – which is part of a broader programme named ISTARI – offer British aerospace engineers a chance to reassert themselves.\n\n“We’re getting a lot of interest from foreign governments about the possibility of providing a radar concept for them,” says Andrew Cawthorne, SSTL’s managing director. “Obviously, the first thing we need to do is deploy this antenna and prove we can take an image.”\n\nThe expectation is that CarbSAR will see objects down to about 50 cm in size, which is more than sufficient to make out tanks and planes.\n\nWhen the antenna is deployed about two days after launch, UK Space Command – which is overseen by the Royal Air Force – will be watching closely.\n\n“CarbSAR is a testament to the innovation and collaboration of one of the UK’s most forward‑thinking space companies,” says Major General Paul Tedman, commander of UK Space Command.\n\n“Space Command is excited to see CarbSAR in action and to explore how its advanced instruments can be integrated into Oberon and our wider ISTARI satellite programme.”",
