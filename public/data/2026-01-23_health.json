      "title": "This new antibody may stop one of the deadliest breast cancers",
      "summary": "Researchers have identified a promising new weapon against triple-negative breast cancer, one of the most aggressive forms of the disease. An experimental antibody targets a protein that fuels tumor growth and shuts down immune defenses, effectively turning the immune system back on. In early tests, the treatment slowed tumor growth, reduced lung metastases, and destroyed chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells.",
      "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is among the most aggressive forms of breast cancer and is especially difficult to treat. It grows rapidly, spreads early, and lacks the hormone receptors that allow many other breast cancers to be treated with targeted drugs. While some patients initially respond to therapy, the disease frequently returns and is often more resistant the second time.\n\nNew research published in Breast Cancer Research highlights a potential new way to tackle this resistance. Scientists at MUSC Hollings Cancer Center developed an experimental antibody designed to interfere with multiple survival strategies used by TNBC cells. In early testing, the antibody slowed the growth of primary tumors, reduced the spread of cancer to the lungs, and revived immune cells that normally attack cancer. The treatment also killed cancer cells that no longer responded to chemotherapy.\n\nTargeting a Key Cancer Enabler\n\nThe preclinical study centered on a protein called secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2). This protein helps tumors thrive by encouraging the formation of new blood vessels, preventing cancer cells from dying, and weakening immune cells that would otherwise help eliminate the cancer.\n\nThe findings build on nearly 20 years of research led by Nancy Klauber-DeMore, M.D., a breast surgical oncologist who co-leads the Developmental Cancer Therapeutics Research Program at Hollings. The project involved a multidisciplinary team from MUSC's Surgery, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Pathology and Laboratory Medicine departments.\n\n\"My lab first identified the role of SFRP2 in breast cancer in 2008,\" Klauber-DeMore said. \"Since then, we've discovered its mechanism of action in breast cancer growth, metastasis and immune exhaustion and developed an antibody to block SFRP2.\"\n\nThe research team, which also included MUSC surgical resident Lillian Hsu, M.D., and former resident Julie Siegel, M.D., tested a humanized monoclonal antibody. This type of antibody is engineered to precisely attach to SFRP2 and block its cancer-promoting effects.\n\nReprogramming the Immune System Around the Tumor\n\nTo determine whether SFRP2 was a meaningful target in TNBC, the researchers first analyzed human tumor samples. They discovered that SFRP2 appeared not only in cancer cells but also in nearby immune cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages.\n\n\"This is the first time anyone has demonstrated that SFRP2 is expressed on tumor-associated macrophages,\" Klauber-DeMore said. \"That finding alone opens up an entirely new way of understanding and potentially manipulating the immune microenvironment.\"\n\nMacrophages generally fall into two categories. M1 macrophages help activate the immune system to fight cancer, while M2 macrophages suppress immune activity and support tumor growth. In TNBC, macrophages tend to shift toward the M2 state. After treatment with the SFRP2 antibody, macrophages released large amounts of interferon-gamma, an immune signaling molecule that pushed them back toward the cancer-fighting M1 state.\n\nEven in mice with advanced disease and existing metastases, the antibody improved the balance between M1 and M2 macrophages. This suggests the treatment may help retrain the immune system to respond to cancer at later stages.\n\n\"We discovered that it pushes macrophages toward the 'good' M1 state -- without the toxic effects you'd see if you gave interferon-gamma directly,\" Hsu said. \"TNBC is so hard to treat, and so many therapies come with serious toxicities, so finding a way to activate the immune system without adding new side effects is especially meaningful.\"\n\nThe antibody also restored activity in T-cells, another critical part of the immune response. In TNBC, these cells often become exhausted and stop functioning properly. After antibody treatment, nearby T-cells became more active, indicating that the therapy could strengthen immune defenses that are typically weakened in cancer and potentially improve responses to immunotherapy.\n\nPrecision Targeting and Reduced Spread\n\nIn two different models of advanced TNBC, mice treated with the antibody developed significantly fewer lung tumors than untreated mice. Lung metastases indicate that cancer has entered the bloodstream and are linked to worse outcomes for patients.\n\nThe antibody's effectiveness was paired with a high level of precision. When researchers tracked where it traveled in the body, they found that it accumulated in tumor tissue but not in healthy organs or normal cells. This targeted behavior differs from traditional chemotherapy, which affects many types of cells and often causes serious side effects.\n\nOvercoming Chemotherapy Resistance\n\nThe team also tested whether the antibody could address one of the biggest challenges in cancer care: resistance to chemotherapy. Doxorubicin, a commonly used drug for TNBC, often stops working over time as tumors adapt. When researchers created cancer cells that no longer responded to doxorubicin, the SFRP2 antibody still caused substantial cancer cell death.\n\n\"That's a very encouraging finding,\" Klauber-DeMore said, \"because it suggests the therapy may be effective even when standard treatments fail.\"\n\nA New Direction for Future Cancer Therapies\n\nThe study showed that SFRP2 is abundant throughout the tumor environment, appearing in cancer cells as well as surrounding immune cells such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-associated macrophages. This widespread presence suggests that targeting SFRP2 could weaken tumors, boost immune activity, and bypass treatment resistance at the same time.\n\nImportantly, SFRP2 did not build up in healthy blood or immune cells. This distinguishes the antibody from many immune-based therapies and supports its potential as a treatment that limits side effects while remaining effective.\n\nBy identifying SFRP2 as a central player linking tumor growth, immune suppression, and drug resistance, the research points to a new type of precision therapy that could complement or strengthen existing immunotherapies for TNBC.\n\n\"Our hope,\" Klauber-DeMore said, \"is that this will one day offer patients a new option -- one that not only treats the cancer but also re-engineers the immune system's ability to fight it.\"\n\nWhile additional studies are required, the early results are encouraging. The antibody has been licensed to Innova Therapeutics, a Charleston-based biotechnology company co-founded by Klauber-DeMore, which is working to secure funding for a first-in-human clinical trial. The therapy has also received Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Disease designations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for osteosarcoma, another cancer strongly linked to SFRP2. These designations do not allow patient use yet but provide incentives to support continued development.\n\n\"The preliminary data are really encouraging,\" Hsu said. \"I feel grateful to have been part of research that could one day help so many patients.\"",

By studying healthy relatives of Crohn’s patients, researchers identified early warning signals long in advance. The findings raise hope for earlier diagnosis and future prevention.",
      "content": "Researchers at Sinai Health have identified a blood test that can signal the risk of Crohn's disease years before symptoms begin. The discovery points to the possibility of diagnosing the condition earlier than ever before and may eventually help doctors intervene before lasting damage occurs.\n\nThe blood test focuses on how the immune system reacts to flagellin, a protein found on certain gut bacteria. According to a research team led by Dr. Ken Croitoru, a clinician scientist at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Sinai Health, people who later develop Crohn's disease often show higher immune responses to this protein long in advance. The study team also included gastrointestinal medical resident Dr. Richard Wu and clinician scientist and staff gastroenterologist Dr. Sun-Ho Lee.\n\nDrs. Croitoru and Lee are also members of Mount Sinai Hospital's Centre for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), an internationally recognized center dedicated to inflammatory bowel disease research.\n\nThe findings were published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology and emphasize how interactions between gut bacteria and the immune system play a crucial role in the early development of Crohn's disease.\n\nA Disease on the Rise\n\nCrohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract that can lead to ongoing digestive problems, pain, and fatigue. These symptoms often have a major impact on daily life. Since 1995, rates of Crohn's disease in children have doubled, and overall cases continue to increase. Crohn's and Colitis Canada, a non profit organization focused on curing inflammatory bowel disease, estimates that about 470,000 Canadians will be living with IBD by 2035.\n\nWhy Early Antibodies Matter\n\nDetecting antibodies to flagellin years before symptoms appear suggests that this immune response may help trigger the disease rather than simply result from it, Dr. Croitoru said. He believes that understanding these early immune changes could lead to new ways to predict who is at risk, prevent the disease from developing, and improve treatment.\n\n\"With all of the advanced biologic therapy we have today, patients' responses are partial at best. We haven't cured anybody yet, and we need to do better,\" said Dr. Croitoru, who hold Canada Research Chair in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\n\nTracking Risk Through the GEM Project\n\nThe study is part of the Genetic, Environmental and Microbial (GEM) Project, a large international effort led by Dr. Croitoru. The project follows more than 5,000 healthy first degree relatives of people with Crohn's disease. Since 2008, researchers have collected genetic, biological, and environmental information to better understand how the disease begins. So far, 130 participants have gone on to develop Crohn's disease, allowing scientists to examine the condition before symptoms emerge.\n\nEarlier work from the team showed that an inflammatory immune response aimed at gut bacteria can appear well before Crohn's disease is diagnosed. In healthy individuals, gut bacteria normally live in balance with the body and support digestion. In people with Crohn's disease, the immune system appears to react abnormally to microbes that are usually beneficial.\n\nBuilding on Earlier Discoveries\n\nPrevious research by collaborators at the University of Alabama, led by Dr. Charles Elson, resulted in a test that detects antibodies against flagellin. That work showed that people with Crohn's disease often have higher antibody levels directed at flagellin from Lachnospiraceae bacteria.\n\nDrs. Croitoru and Lee then asked whether the same immune response could be found in healthy people who were at increased risk of developing Crohn's disease.\n\n\"We wanted to know: do people who are at risk, who are healthy now, have these antibodies against flagellin?\" said Dr. Croitoru. \"We looked, we measured, and yes indeed, at least some of them did.\"\n\nStudy Results and What Comes Next\n\nThe study followed 381 first degree relatives of people with Crohn's disease. During the study period, 77 participants developed the condition. Among them, 28 individuals had elevated antibody levels, accounting for more than a third of those who became ill. The strongest immune responses were seen in siblings, underscoring the importance of shared environmental exposure, as shown previously by Dr. Croitoru.\n\nResearchers also confirmed that this early immune response to Lachnospiraceae flagellin was linked to intestinal inflammation and problems with the gut barrier, both key features of Crohn's disease. On average, participants were diagnosed nearly two and a half years after their blood samples were collected.\n\n\"Confirming our previous study immune response against bacterial flagellins show strong associations with future risk of Crohn's in healthy first-degree relatives,\" said Dr. Lee. \"We found that this immune response is driven by a conserved domain of the flagellin protein. This raises the potential for designing a flagellin-directed vaccine in selected high-risk individuals for prevention of disease. Further validation and mechanistic studies are underway.\"",

      "summary": "Fungal infections are becoming deadlier as drug resistance spreads and treatment options stall. Researchers at McMaster University discovered that a molecule called butyrolactol A can dramatically weaken dangerous fungi, allowing existing antifungal drugs to work again. Instead of killing the fungus directly, the molecule sabotages a vital internal system, leaving the pathogen exposed. The breakthrough could help revive an entire class of antifungal medicines once thought obsolete.",
      "content": "Fungal infections claim millions of lives every year, yet treatment options have failed to keep pace with the growing danger. Scientists at McMaster University now report a discovery that could shift that balance. They have identified a molecule called butyrolactol A that targets a highly dangerous disease-causing fungus known as Cryptococcus neoformans.\n\nCryptococcus infections can be life-threatening. The fungus often triggers pneumonia-like illness and is especially hazardous for people with weakened immune systems, including cancer patients and individuals living with HIV. It is also known for resisting many available drugs. Other fungal threats show similar behavior, including Candida auris and Aspergillus fumigatus. Like Cryptococcus, both have been designated priority pathogens by the World Health Organization.\n\nDespite the severity of these infections, doctors are limited to just three major antifungal treatment options.\n\nLimited Treatments and Toxic Side Effects\n\nThe most effective antifungal drugs belong to a class called amphotericin. However, these drugs are notorious for harming patients as well as pathogens. Gerry Wright, a professor in McMaster's Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, jokes that amphotericin is often referred to as \"amphoterrible\" because of its severe toxic effects on humans.\n\n\"Fungal cells are a lot like human cells, so the drugs that hurt them tend to hurt us too,\" he says. \"That's why there are so few options available to patients.\"\n\nThe remaining two antifungal drug classes, azoles and echinocandins, are far less effective, particularly against Cryptococcus. According to Wright, azoles only slow fungal growth instead of killing the organism. Echinocandins have become useless against Cryptococcus and several other fungi due to widespread resistance.\n\nTurning to Helper Molecules for a New Strategy\n\nWith few approved drugs, little progress in the antifungal pipeline, and rising resistance, researchers are now focusing on a different approach using compounds known as adjuvants.\n\n\"Adjuvants are helper molecules that don't actually kill pathogens like drugs do, but instead make them extremely susceptible to existing medicine,\" explains Wright, a member of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research (IIDR).\n\nTo find an adjuvant that could make Cryptococcus more vulnerable to treatment, Wright's team screened thousands of compounds from McMaster's extensive chemical library.\n\nRediscovering an Overlooked Molecule\n\nThe researchers quickly identified a promising candidate. Butyrolactol A is a molecule produced by certain Streptomyces bacteria that had been known for decades but largely ignored. When paired with echinocandin drugs, the compound enabled those drugs to kill fungi they could not eliminate on their own.\n\nAt first, the team did not understand how the molecule worked and nearly dismissed it.\n\n\"This molecule was first discovered in the early 1990s, and nobody has ever really looked at it since,\" Wright says. \"So, when it showed up in our screens, my first instinct was to walk away from it. I thought, 'it's a known compound, it kind of looks like amphotericin, it's just another toxic molecule, not worth our time.'\"\n\nPersistence Pays Off\n\nWright says the project continued thanks to the persistence of postdoctoral fellow Xuefei Chen.\n\n\"Early on, this molecule's activity appeared to be quite good,\" says Chen, who works in Wright's lab. \"I felt that if there was even a small chance that it could revive an entire class of antifungal medicine, we had to explore it.\"\n\nYears of detailed investigation followed, which Wright describes as \"painstaking sleuthing and detective work.\" That effort ultimately revealed how butyrolactol A functions.\n\nHow the Molecule Disarms Deadly Fungi\n\nChen discovered that butyrolactol A blocks a protein complex that is essential for Cryptococcus survival. Wright describes the effect vividly. \"When it's jammed, all hell breaks loose.\" Once this critical system is disrupted, the fungus becomes fully exposed to drugs it previously resisted.\n\nFurther experiments showed the molecule has similar effects on Candida auris. The team worked alongside researchers in the lab of McMaster Professor Brian Coombes, also a member of the IIDR. These results suggest the discovery could have broad clinical potential beyond a single pathogen.\n\nMore Than a Decade in the Making\n\nWright says the findings, recently published in the journal Cell, represent more than ten years of research.\n\n\"That first screen that put butyrolactol A on our radar took place in 2014,\" he notes. \"More than eleven years later, thanks almost entirely to Chen, we have identified a legitimate drug candidate and an entirely new target to attack with other new drugs.\"\n\nThe breakthrough marks the second antifungal compound and the third new antimicrobial discovered by Wright's lab within the past year.",

      "content": "Donated placentas can be processed into thin, sterilised sheets that are packed with natural healing substances and reduce scarring when applied to wounds\n\nA scanning electron micrograph of a section through a human placenta Science Photo Library\n\nSkin wounds heal with less scarring when thin sheets of dried human placenta are applied as dressings, according to research in mice and people.\n\nThe placenta’s healing properties have been known since at least the early 1900s, when the tissue was sometimes applied to burns to reduce scarring. However, the treatment fell out of favour due to the potential risk of disease transmission.\n\nNow, with new ways to safely sterilise and preserve placentas, such dressings are once again gaining attention. In particular, researchers have been investigating the healing properties of the amniotic membrane, the innermost layer of the placenta that faces the fetus during pregnancy and contains a rich variety of growth factors and immune-modulating proteins.\n\nSeveral US companies have started harvesting amniotic membranes from placentas donated after planned Caesarean sections. They peel this thin membrane from the rest of the placenta, freeze-dry it, cut it to standard sizes, package it and sterilise it with radiation. This preserves its growth factors and other healing substances, while destroying any pathogens. The resulting tissue paper-like sheets can then be used as wound dressings.\n\nTo find out whether these reduce scarring, Geoffrey Gurtner at the University of Arizona and his colleagues made surgical incisions on the backs of anaesthetised mice, and used a device to pull at the sides of the wounds and slow the healing process.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nWhen the wounds were left untreated, they healed poorly, with large, lumpy scars. In contrast, when human amniotic membrane dressings were applied, the wounds healed much better, with thinner, flatter, barely visible scars. The dressings didn’t trigger adverse reactions in the mice due to the placenta having “immune privilege”, a state that prevents attack from the immune system.\n\nSome US surgeons and physicians are already experimenting with using amniotic membrane dressings on people’s wounds, since the Food and Drug Administration permits their clinical use. For example, they are being applied to surgical wounds and chronic, non-healing ones caused by conditions like diabetes.\n\nA study that came out in June 2025 gave us an idea of how well these dressings work in real-life clinical settings. Ryan Cauley at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and his colleagues combed through a large US-wide database of anonymous patient health records, from which they identified 593 people who had received amniotic membrane dressings to treat chronic wounds or burns and compared them with 593 similar individuals who had been given other treatments.\n\nThe researchers found that the wounds treated with amniotic membrane dressings were less likely to become infected and to develop thick, raised scars, known as hypertrophic scars. This validates the growing popularity of these dressings, although Cauley and his colleagues note in their paper that “additional prospective, randomized studies with extended follow-up periods are warranted to validate these findings”.\n\nMeanwhile, other groups are exploring the potential of placental tissue to heal organs other than the skin. For example, in 2023, Hina Chaudhry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and her colleagues found that injections of placental cells repaired heart injuries in mice, suggesting they may one day be used to treat damage from heart attacks.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long known that the human placenta, the organ that supports babies before birth, has natural healing powers. In the early 1900s, doctors used placenta tissue to treat burns and reduce scars, but worries about disease stopped this practice. Now, new methods can safely sterilize and preserve placenta tissue for medical use.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers in the US have developed thin, sterilized sheets made from the amniotic membrane, the inner layer of the placenta. These sheets keep natural substances that help wounds heal. Tests on mice showed that wounds treated with these sheets healed with much smaller scars. Doctors are already using them on patients, especially for surgical wounds and hard-to-heal wounds like those from diabetes. A study of nearly 600 patients found that those treated with these sheets had fewer infections and less scarring compared to other treatments.\n\n**Impact** – This treatment is important because it improves how wounds heal, making scars smaller and less noticeable. It also lowers the chance of infection. The placenta’s ability to avoid immune reactions means the sheets are safe to use. This offers a new option for people with wounds that normally heal poorly, such as diabetics. It also shows how a natural part of the body can be turned into a helpful medical product.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers want to do more studies to confirm how well these placenta sheets work over time. Scientists are also exploring if placental tissue can help repair other organs, like the heart, which could lead to new treatments for heart injuries in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Sterilized sheets made from human placenta improve wound healing by reducing scars and infections, offering a promising new treatment for patients with difficult wounds.",

Aujourd’hui, de nouvelles méthodes permettent de stériliser et de conserver le tissu placentaire en toute sécurité pour un usage médical.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs américains ont développé de fines feuilles stérilisées à partir de la membrane amniotique, la couche intérieure du placenta. Ces feuilles conservent des substances naturelles qui aident les plaies à guérir. Des tests sur des souris ont montré que les plaies traitées avec ces feuilles cicatrisaient avec des cicatrices beaucoup plus petites. Des médecins les utilisent déjà chez des patients, surtout pour des plaies chirurgicales et des plaies difficiles à guérir comme celles causées par le diabète. Une étude portant sur près de 600 patients a montré que ceux traités avec ces feuilles avaient moins d’infections et moins de cicatrices que ceux recevant d’autres traitements.\n\n**Impact** – Ce traitement est important car il améliore la guérison des plaies en réduisant la taille et la visibilité des cicatrices. Il diminue aussi le risque d’infection. La capacité du placenta à éviter les réactions immunitaires rend ces feuilles sûres à utiliser. Cela offre une nouvelle option pour les personnes ayant des plaies qui guérissent mal, comme les diabétiques. Cela montre aussi comment une partie naturelle du corps peut être transformée en produit médical utile.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs veulent réaliser plus d’études pour confirmer l’efficacité de ces feuilles de placenta sur le long terme.
