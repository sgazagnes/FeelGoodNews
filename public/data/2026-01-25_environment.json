      "title": "This small soil upgrade cut locust damage and doubled yields",
      "summary": "Locust swarms can wipe out crops across entire regions, threatening food supplies and livelihoods. Now, scientists working with farmers in Senegal have shown that improving soil health can dramatically reduce locust damage. By enriching soil with nitrogen, crops become less appealing to the insects, leading to fewer locusts, less plant damage, and harvests that doubled in size.",
      "content": "\"They're very destructive when there's a lot of them, but one-on-one, what's not to love?\" says Arianne Cease. She is referring to locusts.\n\nCease leads Arizona State University's Global Locust Initiative, where she studies how locusts behave and how their destructive swarms can be controlled. While her research focuses on reducing damage to crops and communities, she also brings a deep respect for the insects themselves.\n\nLocust Swarms Remain a Global Threat\n\nFor many people, locust swarms evoke images of ancient plagues, but the danger is very real today. Around the world, swarms can devastate crops across vast regions, wipe out livelihoods, and in some areas disrupt education and long term economic prospects for children. A single swarm can span hundreds of square miles -- roughly the size of a major city such as New York City or Phoenix.\n\nThat is why Cease and her international research team paid close attention when they identified a straightforward, soil-based way to reduce locust feeding. The scientists realized early on that the approach could have life changing consequences. To their knowledge, this is the first study to test the method in real farming environments and show that it works outside the lab.\n\nTesting the Idea With Farmers in Senegal\n\nThe researchers partnered with farmers in Senegal who regularly face outbreaks of the Senegalese grasshopper. Unlike the desert locust, this species does not form massive swarms, but its frequent appearances and smaller groupings can cause even greater harm to local farmers. These communities had previously collaborated with Cease and pushed for a larger field study.\n\nEach farmer planted two plots of millet -- one treated with nitrogen fertilizer and one left untreated.\n\nThe contrast was clear. Fertilized plots had fewer locusts, reduced crop damage, and harvests that were twice as large as those from untreated fields.\n\n\"This breakthrough represents an important step forward in the sustainable management of migratory pests, offering a community-based tool that expands the available treatment options,\" says Cease, who is also an associate professor in the ASU School of Sustainability and School of Life Sciences.\n\nThe study published in the journal Scientific Reports. Associate Professor Mamour Touré of Université Gaston Berger in Saint-Louis, Senegal, served as lead author, while Cease was the principal investigator for the USAID-supported project.\n\n\"The results are of major importance to the scientific community and also to Senegalese farmers,\" Touré says. \"The study gave them a better understanding of grasshoppers and locusts, as well as a practical way to control them at the local level.\"\n\nWhy Soil Quality Shapes Locust Behavior\n\nThe Global Locust Initiative is part of the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory and focuses on the many systems that influence locust outbreaks. Environmental conditions, insect biology and behavior, economic pressures, public policy, and land management all contribute to cycles of destruction -- and also create opportunities to interrupt them.\n\nAfter more than 15 years of research, Cease uncovered a consistent pattern. Crops grown in nutrient-poor soil tend to encourage locust outbreaks because those plants contain high levels of carbohydrates and very little protein.\n\n\"This carbohydrate bias, or the 'donut diet,' is optimal for populations of locusts and swarming grasshoppers,\" Cease says. Much like endurance athletes who rely on carbohydrates for energy, locusts depend on carb-heavy plants to fuel their long-distance movement.\n\nPlants grown in nitrogen-rich soil tell a different story. They contain more protein and fewer carbohydrates, making them difficult food for locusts. Their bodies struggle to process the excess protein and fail to get enough energy to thrive.\n\nProtein-Packed Plants Prevent Pests\n\nThese findings led to a key question. Could shifting the balance of protein and carbohydrates in crops prevent locust damage? Earlier lab experiments and field observations hinted that it might, but the idea had never been tested on working farms. For Cease, that gap made the next step obvious.\n\nTwo Senegalese villages that had collaborated with her before volunteered to take part. Their farms regularly suffer severe losses from Senegalese grasshopper swarms.\n\nIn the experiment, 100 farmers each grew two millet plots each -- one treated with nitrogen fertilizer and one left untreated for comparison.\n\nResearchers were unsure whether locusts might still enter treated plots from nearby untreated fields or whether higher protein plants might attract other pests. To find out, the team counted locusts and measured crop damage three times during the growing season and recorded yields at harvest.\n\nThe results were decisive. Treated plots had fewer locusts, less leaf damage, and double the millet yield at harvest. The team also found no evidence that adding nitrogen worsened other pest problems.\n\nFrom Fertilizer to Compost Solutions\n\nAlthough nitrogen fertilizer was supplied for the study, it is not a realistic long term option for many farming communities. Sustainable control requires affordable methods that also protect soil health.\n\n\"Ongoing work is focused exclusively on compost, and we seem to be getting the same results,\" Cease says.\n\nUSAID funding for the project ended in early 2025, but farmers in Senegal have continued the composting approach on their own, encouraged by the results.\n\n\"Farmers unanimously stated that they no longer burn crop residues after land clearing, but instead practice composting to fertilize their fields, thereby helping to reduce grasshopper infestations. This technique was fully mastered thanks to the project,\" Touré says.\n\nThe research team is now seeking additional funding to expand the work into other regions heavily affected by locusts.\n\nWhy Locust Research Matters to the United States\n\nThe U.S. currently has no native locust species. So why study them at all? Cease says that could change. She is closely monitoring the Central American locust, whose range reaches within about 200 miles of the U.S. border.\n\n\"We can say with pretty high certainty that Texas will be very suitable for locusts in about 10 to 15 years,\" Cease says. \"Whether or not they will create a problem is yet to be determined, but it's something that we should definitely be aware of.\"\n\nEven without locusts, grasshoppers already pose major challenges across the country. There are 12 key species known collectively as the Dirty Dozen.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, these 12 rangeland grasshoppers (plus one cricket) are among the most serious pest threats in the western United States. When they swarm, they can strip grazing land and outcompete livestock for food, creating serious problems for ranchers.\n\nWhile chemical pesticides remain the primary control tool, the Global Locust Initiative is working to identify alternatives that are safer for people and the environment.\n\nWhat scientists learn from locust outbreaks abroad may prove critical at home, helping the U.S. manage migratory pests more effectively and prepare for the possibility that locusts one day cross the border.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Locust swarms can destroy crops over large areas, threatening farmers’ food and income. These insects eat plants quickly and in big groups, making it hard to grow enough food in some parts of the world.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists from Arizona State University worked with farmers in Senegal to test if adding nitrogen to soil could help. They planted millet in two ways: one with nitrogen fertilizer and one without. The fields with nitrogen had fewer locusts eating the plants, less damage, and the harvest was twice as big.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time this method was tested on real farms and shown to work well outside the lab. Crops grown with nitrogen have more protein and less sugar, which makes locusts less interested in eating them. This simple soil change can help farmers protect their crops naturally, without harmful chemicals.\n\n**What’s next step** – Because fertilizer can be expensive, the team is now working on using compost to improve soil the same way. Farmers in Senegal have already started using compost, which helps keep their soil healthy and reduces locust problems. The researchers hope to expand this approach to other places affected by locusts.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Adding nitrogen to soil changes plant nutrition, making crops less tasty to locusts and doubling harvests for farmers in Senegal.\n",

      "title": "New catalyst makes plastic upcycling 10x more efficient than platinum",
      "summary": "Scientists are finding new ways to replace expensive, scarce platinum catalysts with something far more abundant: tungsten carbide. By carefully controlling how tungsten carbide’s atoms are arranged at extremely high temperatures, researchers discovered a specific form that can rival platinum in key chemical reactions, including turning carbon dioxide into useful fuels and chemicals. Even more promising, the same material proved dramatically better at breaking down plastic waste, outperforming platinum by more than tenfold.",
      "content": "Many common products, including plastics and detergents, rely on chemical reactions that depend on catalysts made from precious metals such as platinum. These metals are effective but costly and limited in supply. For years, scientists have been searching for alternatives that are cheaper and more sustainable. One promising option is tungsten carbide, an Earth-abundant material already widely used in industrial machinery, cutting tools, and chisels.\n\nDespite its potential, tungsten carbide has not been easy to use as a catalyst. Its chemical behavior can be unpredictable, which has restricted its broader adoption. Researchers led by Marc Porosoff, an associate professor in the University of Rochester's Department of Chemical and Sustainability Engineering, have now made important progress that could allow tungsten carbide to compete with platinum in key chemical reactions.\n\nWhy Atomic Structure Matters\n\nAccording to Sinhara Perera, a chemical engineering PhD student in Porosoff's lab, one of the main challenges lies in how tungsten carbide atoms arrange themselves.\n\nTungsten carbide's atoms can form many different configurations, known as phases, says Perera. These phases can strongly influence how well the material performs as a catalyst.\n\n\"There's been no clear understanding of the surface structure of tungsten carbide because it's really difficult to measure the catalytic surface inside the chambers where these chemical reactions take place,\" she says.\n\nTo address this problem, the research team designed a method to precisely control the structure of tungsten carbide during active reactions. In a study published in ACS Catalysis, Porosoff, Perera, and chemical engineering undergraduate student Eva Ciuffetelli '27 manipulated tungsten carbide particles at the nanoscale inside chemical reactors that operate at temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius.\n\nUsing a technique called temperature-programmed carburization, the researchers created tungsten carbide catalysts in specific phases directly inside the reactor. They then ran chemical reactions and analyzed which versions delivered the strongest performance.\n\n\"Some of the phases are more thermodynamically stable, so that's where the catalyst inherently wants to end up,\" says Porosoff. \"But other phases that are less thermodynamically stable are more effective as catalysts.\"\n\nThe team identified one phase in particular, β-W2C, that showed exceptional performance in reactions that convert carbon dioxide into key building blocks for fuels and useful chemicals. With additional optimization by industry, the researchers believe this form of tungsten carbide could match platinum's effectiveness without its high price or supply limitations.\n\nTurning Plastic Waste Into New Materials\n\nBeyond carbon dioxide conversion, Porosoff and his collaborators have also explored tungsten carbide as a catalyst for recycling plastic waste. Their work focuses on upcycling, a process that transforms discarded plastics into higher-value products rather than lower-grade materials.\n\nIn a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, led by Linxao Chen from the University of North Texas and supported by Porosoff and University of Rochester Assistant Professor Siddharth Deshpande, researchers demonstrated how tungsten carbide can drive a chemical process known as hydrocracking.\n\nHydrocracking breaks large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused to make new materials. In this case, the team targeted polypropylene, which is used in water bottles and many other plastic products.\n\nWhile hydrocracking is common in oil and gas refining, applying it to plastic waste has proven difficult. The long polymer chains in single-use plastics are extremely stable, and contaminants in waste streams can quickly deactivate traditional catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts also rely on microporous structures that are too small for large plastic molecules to enter, limiting their effectiveness.\n\n\"Tungsten carbide, when made with the correct phase, has metallic and acidic properties that are good for breaking down the carbon chains in these polymers,\" says Porosoff. \"These big bulky polymer chains can interact with the tungsten carbide much easier because they don't have micropores that cause limitations with typical platinum-based catalysts.\"\n\nThe results were striking. Tungsten carbide was not only far less expensive than platinum catalysts, but it was also more than 10 times as efficient in hydrocracking plastic waste. Researchers say this approach could open new pathways for recycling plastics and advancing a circular economy where materials are continuously reused.\n\nMeasuring Heat Where It Matters\n\nA key factor behind these advances is the ability to precisely measure temperature on catalyst surfaces. Chemical reactions either absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic), and managing temperature is critical for efficiency. Many industrial processes rely on multiple reactions occurring together, making accurate temperature control even more important.\n\nCurrent temperature measurement methods provide only rough averages, which can hide critical variations at the catalyst surface. This lack of precision makes it difficult to fully understand and reproduce catalytic behavior.\n\nTo solve this problem, the research team adopted optical measurement techniques developed in the lab of Andrea Pickel, a visiting professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. In a study published in EES Catalysis, they described a new method for directly measuring temperatures inside chemical reactors.\n\n\"We learned from this study that depending on the type of chemistry, the temperature measured with these bulk readings can be off by 10 to 100 degrees Celsius,\" says Porosoff. \"That's a really significant difference in catalytic studies where you're trying to ensure that measurements are reproducible and that multiple reactions can be coupled.\"\n\nUsing this technique, the team examined tandem catalyst systems in which heat released by one reaction drives another reaction that requires heat input. Better matching these reactions can reduce wasted energy and improve overall efficiency.\n\nPorosoff says the method could influence how catalysis research is conducted more broadly, encouraging more accurate measurements, stronger reproducibility, and more reliable results across the field.\n\nFunding and Support\n\nThe ACS Catalysis study was supported by the Sloan Foundation and the Department of Energy. The Journal of the American Chemical Society research received funding from the National Science Foundation. The EES Catalysis study was funded by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority through the Carbontech Development Initiative.",

      "title": "This Brooklyn bagel shop is saving money with plug-in batteries",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nIn the back of Black Seed Bagels in northern Brooklyn is a giant catering kitchen filled with industrial-size condiments and freezers full of dough. A tall, silver electric oven, named the Baconator, stands in a far corner, cooking thousands of pounds of meat every week to accompany Black Seed’s hand-rolled, wood-fired bagels.\n\nThe Baconator is connected to a battery the size of a carry-on suitcase, which is plugged into the wall. While the morning rush is underway, the 2.8-kilowatt-hour battery can directly power the commercial oven to reduce the company’s reliance on the electric grid, Noah Bernamoff, Black Seed’s co-owner, explained recently at the company’s Bushwick shop. Two more batteries are paired with energy-intensive refrigerators in the front.\n\nBusinesses like Black Seed often pay hefty demand charges on their utility bills that reflect the maximum amount of power they use during a month — costs that can represent as much as half their total bill, on average. By shifting to battery power during key times, Black Seed aims to lower its peak grid needs and reduce monthly fees from the utility Con Edison in the process.\n\nBlack Seed is part of a battery pilot program run by David Energy, a New York–based retail energy provider. The startup supplied the batteries for free last August and, using its software platform, controls exactly when the three appliances draw on backup power. Vivek Bhagwat, David Energy’s head of engineering, said he expects that tapping batteries for the refrigerators — which are always humming — will be especially helpful during the hottest months, when the shop’s air conditioners run around the clock.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\n“We’re pretty optimistic about our ability to curtail energy in the summer, when it really matters most, through this machine,” he said while standing beside a doorless fridge holding water, juice, and soda.\n\nNoah Bernamoff at Black Seed’s Bushwick shop, which serves as the Brooklyn company’s headquarters. Maria Gallucci / Canary Media\n\nFor Black Seed, even modest benefits from batteries could make a difference if multiplied across the company’s 10 locations in New York City, Bernamoff said. By way of example, he noted that saving $80 at every shop every month could add up to almost $10,000 a year in avoided utility costs.\n\n“We’re in the game of nickels and dimes,” he said of the bagel business. ​“So we’re always happy to save the money.”\n\nJames McGinniss, David Energy’s CEO, thinks this ​“do-it-yourself battery” strategy has some serious potential to help small businesses combat rising electricity costs, both in New York City and beyond. Along with Black Seed’s Bushwick shop, his company has installed batteries at fast-food restaurants, a day spa, and a dog grooming store, where the battery is cushioning the power draw of a fur-drying machine. As of mid-January, David Energy has signed deals with customers to put plug-in batteries in about 50 locations, adding up to more than 500 kilowatt-hours of energy storage capacity.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nThe startup’s plug-in battery pilot is building on the growing interest in DIY energy technologies worldwide. McGinniss cited the example of balcony solar systems that can plug into standard household electrical outlets, which are big in Germany but aren’t yet allowed under most current electrical codes in the U.S. — although state lawmakers in New York and elsewhere are pushing legislation to change that.\n\nBackup batteries, however, are ready for market. Portable batteries from companies like Jackery and EcoFlow are increasingly affordable and popular options for households that are looking for backup power during blackouts but can’t, or don’t want to, install fossil fuel–burning generators. A handful of startups like Pila Energy have plug-in batteries meant to operate around the clock to reduce utility bills as well as to keep refrigerators and other critical appliances running through power outages.\n\nOutside Black Seed’s shop in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood. Stephanie Primavera / Canary Media\n\nAs a retail energy provider, David Energy competes with large utilities and other energy retailers to provide customers with cheaper electricity plans. It does so primarily by purchasing electricity from wholesale markets and then reselling it to businesses and households. But the battery pilot is part of the company’s broader long-term goal to ​“run the grid 24/7 on clean energy,” McGinniss said.\n\nAs solar and batteries have become ​“the cheapest electron we can create,” giving customers access to those technologies has become a business priority for David Energy as well — ​“because people like cheap energy,” he said. Plug-in batteries, in particular, enable the company to ​“rapidly scale our storage under management, even in the existing regulatory construct,” according to McGinniss.\n\nThat last point underscores the challenges that New York City businesses face in installing the type of wired-in and utility-interconnected battery backup systems that are more common in other parts of the country. For years, concerns about fire risks have led the New York City Fire Department to subject stationary lithium-ion battery installations to strict fire-safety regulations that have made them impractical for most building owners.\n\nLast fall, the New York City Buildings Department issued new rules that industry experts say could make these projects more cost-effective. But that still leaves building owners and battery installers with the task of navigating complex and time-consuming utility interconnection processes — steps that simple plug-in batteries can avoid.\n\nCan free plug-in batteries pay their way?\n\nStill, how can a retail energy provider recoup the cost of supplying batteries to customers for free? McGinniss didn’t disclose the current financials for David Energy’s no-cost battery program. But he did say that the devices offer money-saving opportunities for customers and money-making ones for his business that can expand over time.\n\nFor customers, the fundamental proposition is the opportunity to reduce a big, hard-to-manage portion of their monthly utility bills — the demand charges. Unlike the per-kilowatt-hour ​“volumetric” charges that most households pay, these particular fees are assessed based on the maximum amount of power a business draws from the grid during any 15-minute period within a month. The structure is designed to incentivize customers to reduce peak electricity use, which drives much of the cost for utilities of building and maintaining grid infrastructure.\n\nFor New York City businesses, these demand charges can add up to between 15 percent and 50 percentof a typical commercial customer’s monthly bill, McGinniss explained. Using stored battery power for big appliances that tend to need a lot of energy during those times can significantly reduce those peaks, he said, as shown in this sample graph from Black Seed’s Bushwick location on September 17, 2025.\n\nThe results can vary greatly from customer to customer, though McGinniss estimated that every kilowatt shaved from that peak could cut about $50 from a monthly bill. That’s a good way for David Energy to entice and retain customers, he said. But the startup can also use the same stored battery power to earn revenues for itself.\n\nOne option is participating in so-called demand-response programs, which pay customers to reduce power use during, for instance, hot summer evenings when demand for electricity is putting power plants and grid infrastructure under stress. In New York City, David Energy can participate in programs run by Con Edison and by state grid operator NYISO, McGinniss said.\n\nRetail electricity providers like David Energy can make (or lose) money depending on how cleverly they manage their ever-changing mix of purchases on wholesale energy markets against their commitments to provide their customers with retail power at competitive prices.\n\nIn Texas, the country’s most open and competitive electricity market, energy retailers are building gigawatt-scale ​“virtual power plant” platforms, offering customers free smart thermostats, rooftop solar-and-battery systems, and stand-alone backup batteries. In exchange, these programs ask customers for permission to use those systems to pursue arbitrage opportunities — essentially hedging their wholesale energy-market positions by using batteries to store power when it’s cheaper and avoid pulling it from the grid when it’s more expensive. David Energy is pursuing similar opportunities in Texas as well as in its primary markets in New York and elsewhere in the Northeast.\n\nThe economics of this customer-facing arbitrage expand as the scale of deployments grows, McGinniss said. ​“As you add these things up, it’s a portfolio effect,” he said. ​“There’s a lot more value to unlock down the road.”\n\nTo be clear, relying on systems installed at customers’ homes and businesses puts a lot of risk on the companies fronting the money to install them. These companies need to have technology to communicate with and control the devices to ensure they’re storing and shifting power at times when that’s valuable. And they need contracts that fairly share the savings and revenues with their customers — and build in options for when customers might want to switch to a different energy retailer that comes along with a more attractive offer.\n\nOn that last front, portable batteries are a lot less risky than systems that need to be wired into building electrical panels and interconnected under utility rules, McGinniss noted. ​“If they don’t like the service, we can come pick it up. That’s a remarkable fact about these batteries that changes how you think about financing.”\n\nEven so, Bernamoff at Black Seed Bagels said he’s excited by the longer-term possibility of installing large-scale batteries in the Bushwick store’s basement — particularly as city and state policymakers in New York push to electrify buildings. Today, Black Seed primarily uses fossil-gas appliances and heating systems in its stores. If the company is required to switch to electrified versions, then adding batteries could help it manage its higher electricity bills and limit strain on the local grid, he said.\n\n“The industrial battery side of it all could be really interesting,” Bernamoff said while seated at a café table, beneath a poster advertising the store’s scallion-kimchi cream cheese.\n\n“To the extent that we’d be able to reduce peak power at the service level, instead of piece by piece, now we’re really talking,” he added. ​“Because then every outlet, every light bulb is being better managed and reduced.”",

      "title": "Have environmental microplastics levels been overestimated?",
      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 22 January 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00184-wMicroplastics are everywhere, but new research points to a need to standardize measurements of microparticles.",
      "content": "Microplastics are ubiquitous, but studies disagree on how much of the pollutants are in the atmosphere.Credit: Milos Bicanski/Getty\n\nThe amount of microplastic particles in the atmosphere might be lower than some studies have suggested, possibly even by several orders of magnitude. The finding, published on 21 January in Nature1, comes after a high-profile study, which was published in February, that suggested that the concentration of microplastics in the human brain might have been overestimated2.\n\n“This doesn’t mean we don’t have a lot of microplastics in the atmosphere,” says Ioanna Evangelou, an environmental scientist at the University of Vienna. But it does point to a need to broaden and standardize the measurements of microplastics globally, she adds.\n\nMany human activities — from improper disposal of waste to the degradation of car tyres — release small plastic particles, which have infiltrated the atmosphere, oceans and other ecosystems. These include nanoplastics — particles measuring less than 1 micrometre across — and microplastics, which range from 1 micrometre to around 5 millimetres. They’ve entered our bodies and brains, and scientists are still working to understand their effects on people’s health.\n\n“We should not believe that this is not an issue,” says Evangelou. She hopes that the main message of the results will not be used to dismiss the problem of atmospheric microplastics. Research on the biological effects of microplastics is still in its infancy, which means that it is not clear whether the levels humans are exposed to — whatever those levels are — are safe.\n\nMicroplastic emissions\n\nStudies that have estimated the concentration of microplastics in the atmosphere show high levels of variability, with results ranging across several orders of magnitude. And studies that have taken measurements from a region in the western United States have been used to infer global emissions.\n\nEvangelou and her team aimed to get a better handle on microplastic concentrations by compiling two sets of existing studies — those that estimated global microplastic emissions, and those that measured the particles found in environmental samples. They then used the second set to assess the validity of the first.\n\nThe researchers fed the estimated emissions data into a computer simulation of how the atmosphere transports pollutants. The simulation gave predictions of the concentrations of microparticles that would be found across the globe. But the predicted amounts did not match those found in samples at 283 different locations worldwide.\n\nThe difference was stark — in some cases, the microplastic measurements from environmental samples were orders of magnitude smaller than the models predicted. The team also estimated that 27 times more microplastic particles are emitted from activities on land than from the ocean.\n\nAre microplastics bad for your health? More rigorous science is needed\n\nIn particular, the study estimates that the amount of microplastics released from the ocean into the atmosphere is less than estimated in some previous studies, including one co-authored by Natalie Mahowald3, an atmospheric scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Mahowald says her team’s estimates had “huge uncertainty bars”, and they are still compatible with the new findings1.\n\n“As stated in the paper, there are many continuing uncertainties in microplastics, and more data are needed, especially in new locations, and more information about the size distributions,” adds Mahowald.\n\nStephanie Wright, an environmental toxicologist at Imperial College London, says that one limitation of the study is that it included models of emissions from the degradation of tyres among the inputs — and that the microplastic particles released from tyres would not normally show up in environmental samples. Evangelou agrees, but she adds that her team included tyre particles as a proxy for general human activities that can release microplastics.",
