      "content": "Teachers to be trained to spot early signs of misogyny in boys\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Sima Kotecha Senior UK correspondent Share Save\n\nPA Media\n\nTeachers will be given training to spot the signs of misogyny and tackle it in the classroom as part of the government's long-awaited strategy to halve violence against women and girls within the next decade. The plans - which focus on preventing the radicalisation of young men - are due to be unveiled on Thursday, after being pushed back three times this year. Pupils will be taught about issues such as consent, the dangers of sharing intimate images, how to identify positive role models, and to challenge unhealthy myths about women and relationships. The £20m package will also include a new helpline for teenagers to get support for concerns about abuse in their own relationships.\n\nThe government hopes that by tackling the early roots of misogyny, it will prevent young men from becoming violent abusers. Under the new plans, schools will send high-risk students to get extra care and support, including behavioural courses to tackle their prejudice against women and girls. \"Every parent should be able to trust that their daughter is safe at school, online and in her relationships, but too often, toxic ideas are taking hold early and going unchallenged,\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said about the new measures. \"This government is stepping in sooner - backing teachers, calling out misogyny, and intervening when warning signs appear to stop harm before it starts.\" The taxpayer will foot £16m of the bill, while the government says it is working closely with philanthropists and other partners on an innovation fund for the remaining £4m. Nearly 40% of teenagers in relationships are victims of abuse, domestic abuse charity Reducing the Risk has said. Online influencers are partly blamed for feeding this, with nearly one in five boys aged 13 to 15 said to hold a positive view of the self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate, according to a YouGov poll. In response to the government plans, some teachers said schools were already doing the kind of work the measures outlined. \"While we welcome any initiative that prioritises healthy relationships and consent education, it's important to recognise that schools like Beacon Hill Academy in Dudley have been delivering this work effectively for years,\" Principal Sukhjot Dhami said. \"The challenge isn't starting from scratch: it's ensuring that this £20m pounds is spent wisely and in partnership with schools already leading the way.\" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said it was positive the government was recognising the importance of training and support for school staff. Mr Whiteman said schools were \"just part of the solution\", with government, health, social care, police and parents all having a \"significant contribution to make too\". Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the government's focus, but added it was also essential that the government introduced \"effective measures to prevent at source the spread of online misogynistic content which is served up to young people by social media algorithms\".\n\nNicola Mclafferty, a domestic abuse survivor, is calling for more people to talk to children about their experiences",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Violence against women and girls is a serious problem in the UK. The government wants to reduce this by stopping harmful attitudes from developing early, especially in boys at school.\n\n**What happened** – The UK government announced a £20 million plan to train teachers to recognize early signs of misogyny, which means negative and unfair attitudes toward women. This training will help teachers teach pupils about consent, healthy relationships, and the dangers of sharing private images. High-risk students will receive extra support to change harmful behaviors. A new helpline will also be set up for teenagers who need help with relationship abuse.\n\n**Impact** – This plan is important because it focuses on stopping violence before it starts by changing young boys' attitudes. Nearly 40% of teenagers in relationships have experienced abuse, so teaching respect early could make a big difference. The government is also working with charities and schools to make sure the money is spent well.\n\n**What’s next step** – The government will begin training teachers and launch the helpline soon. Schools will identify students who need extra help, and the government will work with other groups to reduce harmful messages online that influence young people.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The UK government is investing in teacher training and support programs to prevent young boys from developing harmful attitudes toward women, aiming to reduce violence in the future.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nAs the federal minimum wage remains frozen at $7.25 an hour, unchanged since 2009, cities and states across the United States are taking matters into their own hands. In 2026, 88 jurisdictions will raise their minimum wage rates, offering millions of workers a critical boost in take-home pay.\n\nDozens of cities and states are stepping up with scheduled wage hikes designed to offset the rising cost of living. According to a new report by the National Employment Law Project (NELP), 19 states and 49 local governments will implement higher wage floors starting in January, with more to follow by year’s end.\n\nWhile the federal government has not acted in over 15 years, these regional increases signal a growing shift in how local leaders are addressing the realities of inflation, stagnant wages, and the pressures facing low-income workers.\n\nFrom coast to coast, the $15 milestone spreads\n\nIn many of the jurisdictions making changes, the minimum wage will cross or exceed the long-debated $15-per-hour benchmark.\n\nNebraska’s wage will jump from $13.50 to $15 per hour.\n\nRhode Island will see an increase from $15 to $16.\n\nIn Denver, minimum pay will rise to $19.29, one of the highest rates in the nation.\n\nFlagstaff workers will move from $17.85 to $18.35 an hour.\n\nThese adjustments arrive at a time when ordinary life expenses like housing, groceries, and utilities continue to rise. And for low-wage earners, even small gains in hourly pay can mean the difference between getting by and falling behind.\n\n“They are really struggling right now,” said Yannet Lathrop, senior researcher and policy analyst at NELP. “These wages basically mitigate the effects of inflation, the effects of the rising cost of living, and the difficulties so many people are having paying for basics—food, housing, medicine.”\n\nMore than just a paycheck: better wages boost well-being\n\nBeyond financial relief, minimum wage hikes may deliver broader benefits. Studies cited in the NELP report link increased earnings to improvements in mental health, educational outcomes, and overall well-being.\n\n“Things that are going to benefit not just the workers, but also the communities and society as a whole,” Lathrop added.\n\nThat ripple effect, advocates argue, makes minimum wage increases more about investing in the community rather than just a labor policy.\n\nState-level showdowns reflect deeper tensions\n\nWhile the momentum is strong, not all states are on board. In 20 states, the minimum wage is still locked at the federal level of $7.25. These include Texas, Iowa, Alabama, and Wyoming, where no local increases are on the books.\n\nEven in states where voters have approved higher minimums, the politics remain fraught. In Missouri, a ballot measure passed by voters promised a $15 minimum wage and annual adjustments for inflation. But state lawmakers reversed course, repealing the inflation adjustment and cutting a related provision for paid sick leave.\n\nDemocrats called it “absolute disdain” for workers. Meanwhile, Republican Governor Mike Kehoe defended the move, stating:\n\n“Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work—families, job creators, and small business owners—by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates.”\n\nStriking a balance between worker support and business concerns\n\nSome business groups argue that sudden wage hikes can strain small businesses, forcing them to raise prices or reduce staff. That tension played out in Rhode Island, where lawmakers initially proposed raising the minimum wage to $20 per hour by 2030. In response to pushback, the plan was revised to reach $17 by 2027 instead.\n\nRepublican House Minority Whip David Place voiced concerns over job loss, saying, “The real minimum wage is $0. That’s what they make when they get fired because business can’t afford to keep them.”\n\nStill, the revised bill moved forward, reflecting a middle ground between worker support and business sustainability.\n\nLooking ahead: more hikes, more impact\n\nAs the movement for higher wages gains traction, it’s becoming clear that cities and states are not waiting for Washington. While the political battle over a national wage hike continues, local governments are using policy tools they already have to ease economic strain for their residents.\n\nIn many cases, these are pre-scheduled increases tied to inflation, a mechanism designed to make wage adjustments predictable and automatic.\n\nThough the national debate is far from settled, one thing is clear: in 2026, millions of American workers will earn more than they did the year before. And in a landscape of rising costs and economic uncertainty, that’s no small thing.",

      "content": "The Andrei Sakharov Prize, established in 1988, is the highest distinction of the European Union in the field of human rights.\n\nJana Poczobut, daughter of the journalist imprisoned in Belarus, Andrzej Poczobut, received on Tuesday in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, on behalf of her father, the 2025 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. In turn, on behalf of the imprisoned Georgian journalist Mzii Amaglobeli, the prize was received by another journalist, Irma Dimitradze.\n\nPoczobut was nominated for the prize by the European People’s Party group, to which Civic Platform and the Polish People’s Party belong, as well as by the European Conservatives and Reformists group, to which Law and Justice belongs. The winners were chosen in October by the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament, which includes the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, and the leaders of the political groups.\n\n“It is a great honor to stand here today and receive this award on behalf of my father. For almost five years my family has been living in the face of silence and uncertainty, without the person we love. Today I would like to express my deep gratitude to the European Parliament for remembering him – and for remembering all the families who live with the same unanswered questions,” said Jana Poczobut in the European Parliament.\n\nDimitradze read out a speech by Mzii Amaglobeli addressed to the MEPs. “I accept (this award) on behalf of my fellow journalists who are fighting today in Georgia to save journalism. They work tirelessly so that you can hear the voice of resistance of Georgian citizens and so that the truth is not silenced,” she emphasized.\n\nIn her letter, Amaglobeli also referred to the authorities of Georgia. “This regime is ruthless (…). It is destroying free journalism, eliminating opposition political parties and imprisoning their leaders, effectively dismantling non-governmental organizations, and labeling the people who work in them as foreign agents (…). However, it has not managed to silence the protests,” she wrote.\n\nAndrzej Poczobut, a journalist and activist of the Polish minority in Belarus, was arrested in March 2021, and on 8 February 2023 he was sentenced for ‘activities harmful to the interests of the state’ (among other things for calling the attack of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on Poland in 1939 an act of aggression and for materials documenting the protests in 2020) to eight years in a high-security penal colony.\n\nPoland is demanding that the authorities of Belarus release Poczobut and other political prisoners.\n\nMzia Amaglobeli is a Georgian journalist and head of the independent news portals Batumelebi and Netgazeti. She was arrested in January this year for taking part in anti-government protests in Georgia. In August she was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nShe is considered the first political prisoner in Georgia since the country gained independence. As a defender of freedom of speech, Amaglobeli has become a symbol of the pro-democratic protest movement in Georgia, opposing the rule of the pro-Russian Georgian Dream party after the parliamentary elections of October 2024, which, according to the opposition, were rigged.\n\nThe Andrieja Sacharowa Prize, established in 1988, is the European Union’s highest award in the field of human rights. It is awarded to individuals and organizations that have made outstanding contributions to the defense of freedom of speech, human rights and democracy. Among the previous laureates are, among others, the former president of South Africa who brought about the abolition of apartheid, Nelson Mandela, the organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF), the leader of the anti-Kremlin opposition in Russia, Alexei Navalny, and the activist for the rights of the Uyghur minority in China, Ilham Tohti.\n\nMembers of the European Parliament have already adopted several resolutions condemning the repression in Belarus. In them, they demand the release of political prisoners (their number is estimated at over 1,000), condemn President Aleksandra Łukaszenki’s complicity in Russia’s war against Ukraine, and call for tougher sanctions and support for Belarusian democratic forces, independent media and human rights defenders.\n\nAs for Georgia, which since 2023 has been a candidate country for membership in the European Union, MEPs in their resolutions have strongly condemned the democratic backsliding in this country and the repressive regulations (such as the “foreign agents” law), attacks on freedom of speech and the press, and repression of peaceful protests. They also called for the October 2024 elections, in which the ruling Georgian Dream party declared victory, to be held again. (16.12.2025)",

      "summary": "Parliament and Council negotiators have reached a political agreement on updates to the 2024 Asylum Law regarding the conditions for applying the rules on safe third countries.Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Source : © European Union, 2025 - EP",
      "content": "On Thursday the negotiating team of the Civil Liberties Committee informally agreed with the Council new rules under which member states may decide that a non-EU country is a safe third country (STC) with respect to an asylum applicant who is not a national of that country, and may therefore declare their application inadmissible. The deal builds on a proposal by the Commission to update this provision in the Asylum Procedure Regulation.\n\nThe new rules would allow EU countries to apply the STC concept in individual cases where one of these three conditions is met:\n\nthere is a connection between the applicant and a third country ; this connection may be considered established if members of the applicant’s family are present in the third country concerned, if the applicant stayed there previously, or if there are linguistic, cultural or similar links.\n\n; this connection may be considered established if members of the applicant’s family are present in the third country concerned, if the applicant stayed there previously, or if there are linguistic, cultural or similar links. applicants have transited through a third country on the way to the Union, where they could have requested effective\n\non the way to the Union, where they could have requested effective where an agreement or arrangement exists with a third country at a bilateral,multilateral or Union level for the admission of asylum seekers.\n\nUpon conclusion of an agreement or arrangement with a third country, EU countries should have to inform the Commission and other member states before they are provisionally applied, or enter into force, whichever is the earliest. The European Parliament should also be informed about agreements or arrangements at EU level related to the safe third country concept.\n\nUnaccompanied minors will be exempt from the application of safe third country rules based on agreements and arrangements with third countries. In security cases, rules related to unaccompanied minors will apply as agreed in the Asylum Procedure Regulation, including provisions related to accelerated and border procedures.\n\nIn line with the Commission proposal applicants should not have an automatic right to remain in the member state where they requested asylum while an appeal to an inadmissibility decision is resolved.\n\nQuote\n\nRapporteur Lena Düpont (EPP, Germany) said: \" With the Safe Third Country Regulation, we are making the Migration policies credible and operational. As one of the remaining missing pieces of the Common European Asylum System, it brings long-needed coherence and gives member states the flexibility they need to apply the concept effectively and consistently. We want to remove obstacles and ensure that asylum procedures, including return procedures, are faster, clearer and more effective - which is essential to reducing irregular migration and increasing returns. We want to ensure protection is granted where needed, but not automatically inside the EU, if safe and effective protection can be guaranteed elsewhere. Citizens expected us to deliver, and we did.\"\n\nNext steps\n\nThe agreement needs to be formally adopted by Parliament and Council before it can enter into force.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Asylum Procedure Regulation (APR) adopted in May 2024 as part of the Migration and Asylum Pact, will apply from 12 June 2026.\n\nApplication of the safe third country concept is not mandatory and not all EU countries apply it in practice.

      "personality_title": "EU updates asylum rules to improve handling of safe third countries",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union has rules about asylum seekers, including when they can be sent back to a 'safe third country' outside the EU. These rules help decide if a country is safe enough for someone to seek protection there instead of the EU. The current system needed updating to be clearer and fairer.\n\n**What happened** – On Thursday, EU Parliament and Council negotiators agreed on new rules for deciding when a non-EU country can be considered a safe third country. This means EU countries can reject asylum applications if the person has a strong connection to that third country, traveled through it, or if there is an agreement with that country to handle asylum seekers. The deal also protects unaccompanied children by not applying these rules to them. The agreement still needs formal approval before it becomes law.\n\n**Impact** – This update makes the asylum process faster and clearer for EU countries. It helps reduce irregular migration by allowing countries to send applicants to safe places outside the EU where they can get protection. At the same time, it ensures vulnerable people like unaccompanied minors are treated carefully. The new rules give countries more flexibility while keeping protection fair and consistent.\n\n**What's next step** – The agreement must be officially approved by the European Parliament and Council. After that, the updated rules will become part of the Asylum Procedure Regulation, which starts applying from June 2026. EU countries will then be able to use these clearer guidelines in their asylum decisions.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU has agreed on clearer asylum rules that balance faster decisions with strong protection, especially for vulnerable people like unaccompanied children.\n",
      "personality_title_fr": "L’UE met à jour ses règles d’asile pour mieux gérer les pays tiers sûrs",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’Union européenne dispose de règles concernant les demandeurs d’asile, notamment quand ils peuvent être renvoyés vers un « pays tiers sûr » en dehors de l’UE. Ces règles aident à décider si un pays est suffisamment sûr pour que quelqu’un puisse y demander protection au lieu de rester dans l’UE. Le système actuel avait besoin d’être clarifié et amélioré.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Jeudi, les négociateurs du Parlement et du Conseil de l’UE ont trouvé un accord sur de nouvelles règles pour décider quand un pays hors UE peut être considéré comme un pays tiers sûr. Cela signifie que les pays de l’UE peuvent rejeter une demande d’asile si la personne a un lien fort avec ce pays tiers, y a transité, ou s’il existe un accord avec ce pays pour gérer les demandeurs d’asile. L’accord protège aussi les enfants non accompagnés en excluant ces règles pour eux. Cet accord doit encore être officiellement approuvé.\n\n**Impact** – Cette mise à jour rend le processus d’asile plus rapide et plus clair pour les pays de l’UE. Elle aide à réduire la migration irrégulière en permettant d’envoyer les demandeurs dans des endroits sûrs hors UE où ils peuvent être protégés. En même temps, elle garantit un traitement attentif des personnes vulnérables comme les mineurs non accompagnés. Ces nouvelles règles offrent plus de souplesse tout en assurant une protection juste et cohérente.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L’accord doit être officiellement adopté par le Parlement européen et le Conseil. Ensuite, les règles mises à jour feront partie du Règlement sur la procédure d’asile, qui s’appliquera à partir de juin 2026. Les pays de l’UE pourront alors appliquer ces directives plus claires dans leurs décisions d’asile.\n\n**En une phrase** – L’UE a adopté des règles d’asile plus claires qui combinent décisions plus rapides et protection renforcée, notamment pour les personnes vulnérables comme les enfants non accompagnés.\n",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – La Unión Europea tiene reglas sobre solicitantes de asilo, incluyendo cuándo pueden ser enviados a un 'país tercero seguro' fuera de la UE. Estas reglas ayudan a decidir si un país es lo suficientemente seguro para que alguien busque protección allí en lugar de quedarse en la UE. El sistema actual necesitaba una actualización para ser más claro y justo.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El jueves, negociadores del Parlamento y el Consejo de la UE acordaron nuevas reglas para decidir cuándo un país fuera de la UE puede considerarse un país tercero seguro. Esto significa que los países de la UE pueden rechazar solicitudes de asilo si la persona tiene un vínculo fuerte con ese país tercero, ha pasado por allí, o si existe un acuerdo con ese país para manejar a los solicitantes de asilo. El acuerdo también protege a los menores no acompañados al no aplicar estas reglas a ellos. El acuerdo necesita aprobación formal para convertirse en ley.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta actualización hace que el proceso de asilo sea más rápido y claro para los países de la UE. Ayuda a reducir la migración irregular permitiendo que los países envíen a los solicitantes a lugares seguros fuera de la UE donde pueden recibir protección. Al mismo tiempo, garantiza que las personas vulnerables, como los menores no acompañados, sean tratadas con cuidado. Las nuevas reglas dan más flexibilidad a los países manteniendo la protección justa y consistente.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El acuerdo debe ser aprobado oficialmente por el Parlamento Europeo y el Consejo. Después, las reglas actualizadas formarán parte del Reglamento de Procedimiento de Asilo, que se aplicará a partir de junio de 2026. Los países de la UE podrán usar estas guías más claras en sus decisiones de asilo.\n\n**Una frase clave** – La UE ha acordado reglas de asilo más claras que equilibran decisiones más rápidas con una protección fuerte, especialmente para personas vulnerables como menores no acompañados.\n",
