      "content": "New research from NASA's Cassini mission reveals that Enceladus, one of Saturn's most intriguing moons and a prime candidate for extraterrestrial life, is releasing heat from both poles. This surprising discovery suggests the icy world has the long-term thermal balance needed for life to possibly take hold. The findings were published on November 7 in Science Advances.\n\nA team of scientists from Oxford University, the Southwest Research Institute, and the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, has uncovered the first evidence of significant heat flow at Enceladus' north pole. Until now, scientists believed that heat loss was limited to the south pole, where geysers shoot water vapor and ice particles into space. The new measurements confirm that Enceladus is far more thermally active than previously thought, indicating that it generates and releases much more heat than a dormant, frozen moon would.\n\nA Hidden Ocean Beneath the Ice\n\nEnceladus is a geologically active world with a global, salty ocean hidden beneath its icy surface. Scientists believe this ocean is the main source of the moon's internal heat. Because it contains liquid water, warmth, and essential chemical ingredients (such as phosphorus and complex hydrocarbons), this underground sea is considered one of the most promising environments in the solar system for life beyond Earth.\n\nFor life to thrive, Enceladus' ocean must remain stable over long periods, maintaining an equilibrium between energy gained and lost. This balance is sustained through tidal heating, caused by Saturn's powerful gravitational pull that stretches and compresses the moon as it orbits. If too little heat is produced, Enceladus' surface activity would fade, and its ocean could eventually freeze. Too much energy, however, might trigger excessive geological activity, disrupting the delicate environment that supports its ocean.\n\n\"Enceladus is a key target in the search for life outside the Earth, and understanding the long-term availability of its energy is key to determining whether it can support life,\" explained Dr. Georgina Miles (Southwest Research Institute and Visiting Scientist at the Department of Physics, University of Oxford), the study's lead author.\n\nMeasuring Enceladus' Mysterious Warmth\n\nUntil recently, scientists had only measured heat loss at the moon's south pole. The north pole was believed to be geologically quiet and inactive. To challenge this assumption, the research team used data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft to study the north polar region during two key periods: the deep winter of 2005 and the summer of 2015. These observations allowed scientists to estimate how much energy Enceladus loses as heat moves from its relatively \"warm\" subsurface ocean (0°C, 32°F) through its icy crust to the surface, which remains bitterly cold (-223°C, -370°F), before escaping into space.\n\nBy modeling expected surface temperatures during the long polar night and comparing them with infrared data from Cassini's Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS), researchers found that the north pole's surface was roughly 7 K warmer than expected. The only explanation for this excess warmth is heat leaking upward from the hidden ocean.\n\nThe team measured a heat flow of 46 ± 4 milliwatts per square meter. While that may sound modest, it equals about two-thirds of the average heat escaping through Earth's continental crust. Across Enceladus, this amounts to about 35 gigawatts of energy -- roughly the power produced by 66 million solar panels (530 W each) or 10,500 wind turbines (3.4 MW each).\n\nA Stable Ocean Beneath the Ice\n\nWhen the new measurements are combined with the heat previously detected at the active south pole, Enceladus' total heat loss reaches about 54 gigawatts. This figure aligns closely with predictions of how much heat should be generated by tidal forces. The nearly perfect balance between heat creation and loss indicates that Enceladus' ocean could remain liquid for vast spans of time, offering a stable, long-term environment that might allow life to develop.\n\n\"Understanding how much heat Enceladus is losing on a global level is crucial to knowing whether it can support life,\" said Dr. Carly Howett (Department of Physics, University of Oxford and Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona), corresponding author of the study. \"It is really exciting that this new result supports Enceladus' long-term sustainability, a crucial component for life to develop.\"\n\nHow Long Has the Ocean Existed?\n\nThe next challenge for scientists is to determine how long Enceladus' ocean has been around. If it has existed for billions of years, the conditions for life would have been stable long enough for it to potentially emerge. However, the exact age of the ocean remains uncertain.\n\nMapping Enceladus for Future Missions\n\nThe research also demonstrated that thermal readings can help estimate the thickness of Enceladus' ice shell, an important factor for planning future missions that may attempt to explore its ocean using robotic probes or landers. The analysis suggests that the ice is 20 to 23 km thick at the north pole, and about 25 to 28 km thick on average across the moon -- slightly deeper than earlier estimates derived from other models.\n\n\"Eking out the subtle surface temperature variations caused by Enceladus' conductive heat flow from its daily and seasonal temperature changes was a challenge, and was only made possible by Cassini's extended missions,\" added Dr. Miles. \"Our study highlights the need for long-term missions to ocean worlds that may harbor life, and the fact the data might not reveal all its secrets until decades after it has been obtained.\"",

      "title": "Dark energy might be changing and so is the Universe",
      "summary": "New supercomputer simulations hint that dark energy might be dynamic, not constant, subtly reshaping the Universe’s structure. The findings align with recent DESI observations, offering the strongest evidence yet for an evolving cosmic force.",
      "content": "Since the early 20th century, scientists have gathered convincing evidence that the Universe is expanding -- and that this expansion is accelerating. The force responsible for this acceleration is called dark energy, a mysterious property of spacetime thought to push galaxies apart. For decades, the prevailing cosmological model, known as Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM), has assumed that dark energy remains constant throughout cosmic history. This simple but powerful assumption has been the foundation of modern cosmology. Yet, it leaves one key question unresolved: what if dark energy changes over time instead of remaining fixed?\n\nRecent observations have started to challenge this long-held view. Data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- an advanced project that maps the distribution of galaxies across the Universe -- suggests the possibility of a dynamic dark energy (DDE) component. Such a finding would mark a significant shift from the standard ΛCDM model. While this points to a more intricate and evolving cosmic story, it also exposes a major gap in understanding: how a time-dependent dark energy might shape the formation and growth of cosmic structures remains unclear.\n\nSimulating an Evolving Universe\n\nTo explore this mystery, a team led by Associate Professor Tomoaki Ishiyama of Chiba University's Digital Transformation Enhancement Council in Japan carried out one of the most extensive cosmological simulations ever performed. Collaborators included Francisco Prada of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía in Spain and Anatoly A. Klypin of New Mexico State University in the United States. Their study, published in Physical Review D (Volume 112, Issue 4), investigated how a time-varying dark energy could influence the evolution of the cosmos and help interpret future astronomical observations.\n\nUsing Japan's flagship supercomputer, Fugaku, the researchers executed three large, high-resolution N-body simulations, each with a computational volume eight times greater than previous work. One simulation followed the standard Planck-2018 ΛCDM model, while two others incorporated dynamic dark energy. By comparing the DDE model with fixed parameters to the standard model, they were able to isolate the effects of a changing dark energy component. A third simulation used parameters drawn from DESI's first-year data, revealing how an \"updated\" cosmological model might behave if dark energy truly varies with time.\n\nHow a Small Change Can Reshape the Universe\n\nThe results showed that the influence of dark energy variations alone was relatively subtle. However, once the researchers adjusted the cosmological parameters in line with DESI data -- particularly increasing the matter density by about 10% -- the differences became striking. A higher matter density strengthens gravitational attraction, which accelerates the formation of massive clusters of galaxies. In this scenario, the DESI-based DDE model predicted as much as 70% more massive clusters in the early Universe than the standard model. These clusters form the cosmic framework on which galaxies and galaxy groups assemble.\n\nThe team also examined baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs) -- patterns left behind by sound waves in the early Universe that serve as \"cosmic rulers\" for measuring distances. In the DESI-derived DDE simulation, the BAO peak shifted by 3.71% toward smaller scales, closely matching DESI's actual observations. This strong agreement confirmed that the model not only reflects theoretical predictions but also aligns well with real-world data.\n\nMapping Galaxy Clusters and Cosmic Structure\n\nIn addition, the researchers analyzed how galaxies cluster throughout the cosmos. The DESI-based DDE model produced noticeably stronger clustering than the standard ΛCDM version, particularly on smaller scales. The enhanced clustering directly results from the higher matter density, which amplifies gravitational binding. This close match between simulation and observation further supports the validity of the dynamic dark energy model.\n\nOverall, the team's findings clarify how both dark energy and matter density shape the large-scale structure of the Universe. \"Our large simulations demonstrate that variations in cosmological parameters, particularly the matter density in the Universe, have a greater influence on structure formation than the DDE component alone,\" says Dr. Ishiyama.\n\nPreparing for the Next Generation of Cosmic Surveys\n\nWith new observational campaigns on the horizon, these simulations will play a crucial role in interpreting upcoming results. \"In the near future, large-scale galaxy surveys from the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph and DESI are expected to significantly improve measurements of cosmological parameters. This study provides a theoretical basis for interpreting such upcoming data,\" concludes Dr. Ishiyama.",

      "summary": "Astronomers have discovered phosphine gas in the atmosphere of an ancient brown dwarf, Wolf 1130C, using the James Webb Space Telescope. The finding is puzzling because phosphine, a potential biosignature, has been missing from other similar objects. The detection may reveal how phosphorus behaves in low-metal environments or how stellar remnants like white dwarfs enrich their surroundings with this crucial element.",
      "content": "Phosphorus is one of six essential elements that make life on Earth possible. When it bonds with hydrogen, it forms phosphine (PH3), a highly toxic and explosive gas. This compound is found in the atmospheres of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and has long been viewed as a potential biosignature for anaerobic life. On Earth, phosphine arises naturally from decaying organic material in swamps, but on other planets, it is rare and intriguing.\n\nA research team led by University of California San Diego Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Adam Burgasser has now detected phosphine in the atmosphere of a cool, ancient brown dwarf known as Wolf 1130C. Their findings were recently published in Science.\n\nThe team made the discovery using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the first instrument powerful enough to analyze these dim, low-temperature objects in detail. The surprising part, however, is not that phosphine was found -- but that it appears absent from other brown dwarfs and gas giant exoplanets where scientists expected it.\n\nProbing the Chemistry of Ancient Stars\n\n\"Our astronomy program, called Arcana of the Ancients, focuses on old, metal-poor brown dwarfs as a means of testing our understanding of atmospheric chemistry,\" said Burgasser. \"Understanding the problem with phosphine was one of our first goals.\"\n\nUnder normal conditions, phosphine naturally forms in the hydrogen-rich atmospheres of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Because of that, researchers have long assumed it should also exist in similar environments around other stars, including brown dwarfs, which are sometimes called \"failed stars\" because they are too small to fuse hydrogen like true stars.\n\nYet phosphine has been elusive in previous JWST observations, hinting that something might be missing in our understanding of phosphorus chemistry. \"Prior to JWST, phosphine was expected to be abundant in exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, following theoretical predictions based on the turbulent mixing we know exists in these sources,\" explained co-author Sam Beiler, a postdoctoral scholar at Trinity College Dublin who recently earned his doctorate from the University of Toledo.\n\nBeiler, who has led earlier studies investigating this very absence, added, \"Every observation we've obtained with JWST has challenged the theoretical predictions -- that is until we observed Wolf 1130C.\"\n\nThe Unusual System of Wolf 1130ABC\n\nWolf 1130C is part of a complex three-star system located 54 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. The brown dwarf orbits a close binary composed of a cool red star (Wolf 1130A) and a dense white dwarf (Wolf 1130B). Astronomers have long been interested in this system because Wolf 1130C contains far fewer \"metals\" (elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) than the Sun, providing a valuable laboratory for studying primitive cosmic chemistry.\n\nUnlike in previous brown dwarf observations, the JWST data revealed a strong infrared signal from phosphine in Wolf 1130C's atmosphere. To understand how much of the gas was present, the team turned to Assistant Professor Eileen Gonzales from San Francisco State University, who specializes in atmospheric modeling.\n\n\"To determine the abundances of molecules in Wolf 1130C, I used a modeling technique known as atmospheric retrievals,\" said Gonzales. \"This technique uses the JWST data to back out how much of each molecular gas species should be in the atmosphere. It's like reverse engineering a really delicious cookie when the chef wouldn't give up the recipe.\"\n\nHer analysis confirmed that phosphine was present in the predicted amount -- about 100 parts per billion.\n\nWhy This Brown Dwarf and Not Others?\n\nThe discovery raises a new question: why does this particular brown dwarf contain phosphine while others do not? One possibility involves the object's unusual chemical composition. \"It may be that in normal conditions phosphorus is bound up in another molecule such as phosphorus trioxide,\" explained Beiler. \"In the metal-depleted atmosphere of Wolf 1130C, there isn't enough oxygen to take up the phosphorus, allowing phosphine to form from the abundant hydrogen.\"\n\nThe team plans to test this idea through upcoming JWST observations of other metal-poor brown dwarfs to see if the same pattern appears.\n\nA Clue from a Dying Star\n\nAnother hypothesis is that phosphorus may have been produced locally within the Wolf 1130ABC system, specifically by its white dwarf, Wolf 1130B. \"A white dwarf is the leftover husk of a star that has finished fusing its hydrogen,\" said Burgasser. \"They are so dense that when they accrete material on their surface they can undergo runaway nuclear reactions, which we detect as novae.\"\n\nAlthough astronomers have not observed any nova events in this system in recent history, such outbursts often recur every few thousand years. Because Wolf 1130ABC has been known for only about a century, earlier eruptions could have gone unnoticed, leaving behind traces of phosphorus in the surrounding space. Previous research has suggested that many of the Milky Way's phosphorus atoms may have originated from these stellar explosions.\n\nUnraveling the Origins of Phosphorus in the Cosmos\n\nUnderstanding why Wolf 1130C contains clear evidence of phosphine could offer important insights into how phosphorus forms in the galaxy and how it behaves in planetary atmospheres. As Burgasser explained, \"Understanding phosphine chemistry in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs where we don't expect life is crucial if we hope to use this molecule in the search for life on terrestrial worlds beyond our solar system.\"\n\nThis work was supported by NASA/STScI (NAS 5-03127 and AR-2232) and the Heising-Simons Foundation.",

Cela aide à comprendre comment les éléments essentiels comme le phosphore se répandent dans la galaxie et à améliorer la recherche de signes de vie ailleurs.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs vont étudier d'autres naines brunes pauvres en métaux avec le JWST pour voir si elles contiennent aussi de la phosphine. Cela permettra de savoir si Wolf 1130C est unique ou non. Ils continueront aussi à étudier le rôle des naines blanches dans la création du phosphore dans l'espace.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – La découverte de phosphine dans une naine brune ancienne par le télescope James Webb apporte de nouvelles pistes sur la formation et le comportement des éléments liés à la vie dans l'espace.\n",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – El fósforo es un elemento importante para la vida en la Tierra, y cuando se une al hidrógeno, forma gas fosfina. Este gas se encuentra en planetas como Júpiter y Saturno, y a veces se asocia con señales de vida. Los científicos han estado buscando fosfina en el espacio para entender mejor cómo se forma y qué puede revelar sobre otros planetas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Un equipo liderado por el profesor Adam Burgasser usó el telescopio espacial James Webb (JWST) para detectar gas fosfina en la atmósfera de una enana marrón fría y antigua llamada Wolf 1130C. Este objeto está a unos 54 años luz y forma parte de un sistema estelar triple. El hallazgo fue sorprendente porque otras enanas marrones y planetas similares no muestran fosfina, aunque los científicos pensaban que sí.\n\n**Impacto** – Este descubrimiento es importante porque desafía las ideas sobre cómo se forma la fosfina en el espacio. Wolf 1130C tiene muy pocos metales, lo que podría permitir que la fosfina se forme más fácilmente allí. Además, la enana blanca cercana podría haber producido fósforo mediante explosiones estelares raras. Esto ayuda a entender cómo se distribuyen los elementos esenciales como el fósforo en la galaxia y mejora la búsqueda de señales de vida en otros mundos.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores planean usar el JWST para estudiar más enanas marrones pobres en metales y ver si también contienen fosfina. Esto ayudará a confirmar si Wolf 1130C es único o parte de un patrón mayor. También seguirán estudiando el papel de las enanas blancas en la producción de fósforo en el espacio.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – El descubrimiento de gas fosfina en una enana marrón antigua por el telescopio James Webb revela nuevas pistas sobre cómo se forman y comportan los elementos relacionados con la vida en el espacio.\n",
