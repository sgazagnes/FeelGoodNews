      "summary": "South Korea's national college entry exam is notoriously hard - but blind students face unique challenges.",
      "content": "Thirteen hours by touch – inside one of the world's longest exam days\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Hyojung Kim BBC Korean Share Save\n\nBBC/Hosu Lee Han Dong-hyun, a student at Seoul Hanbit School for the Blind, is among those who will take the \"longest version\" of the infamous Suneung exam\n\nEvery November, South Korea comes to a standstill for its infamous college entrance exam. Shops are shut, flights are delayed to reduce noise, and even the rhythm of the morning commute slows down for the students. By late afternoon, most test-takers walk out of school gates, exhaling with relief and embracing the family members waiting outside. But not everyone finishes at that hour. Even once darkness has fully settled and night has set in, some students are still in the exam room - finishing close to 10pm. They are the blind students, who often spend more than 12 hours taking the longest version of the Suneung.\n\nOn Thursday, more than 550,000 students across the country will sit for the Suneung - an abbreviation for College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) in Korean. It is the highest number of applicants in seven years. The test not only dictates whether people will be able to go to university, but can affect their job prospects, income, where they will live and even future relationships. Depending on their subject choices, students answer roughly 200 questions across Korean, mathematics, English, social or natural sciences, an additional foreign language, and Hanja (classical Chinese characters used in Korean). For most students, it is an eight-hour marathon of back-to-back exams. They begin the Suneung test at 08:40 and finish around 17:40. Blind students with severe visual impairments, however, are given 1.7 times the standard testing duration. This means that if they take the additional foreign language section, the exam can finish as late as 21:48 - nearly 13 hours after it began. There is no dinner break; the exam continues straight through. The physical bulk of the braille test papers also contributes to the length. When every sentence, symbol and diagram is converted into braille, each test booklet becomes six to nine times thicker than the standard equivalent.\n\nBBC/Hosu Lee The constant friction from reading braille for hours straight can make students' hands sore\n\nAt Seoul Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Han Donghyun is among the students who will take the longest version of the Suneung this year. Last year, there were 111 blind test-takers nationwide - 99 with low vision and 12 with severe visual impairments like Dong-hyun - according to data from the Ministry of Education and the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation. Dong-hyun was born completely blind and cannot distinguish light. When the BBC met him at his school on 7 November, his fingers moved quickly across a braille practice booklet of past exam questions. With just a week left before the test, he was focused on managing his stamina and condition. Dong-hyun will take the exam using braille test papers and a screen-reading computer. \"It's really exhausting because the exam is so long,\" he said. \"But there's no special trick. I just follow my study schedule and try to manage my condition. That's the only way.\"\n\nDong-hyun said the Korean language section is particularly difficult for him. A standard test booklet for that section is about 16 pages - but the braille version is roughly 100 pages long. Even with screen-reading software, spoken information disappears as soon as it is heard, unlike text that can be seen and re-read. Dong-hyun has to hold the details in his memory as he goes. The mathematics section is no easier. He must interpret complex graphs and tables that have been converted into braille, using only his fingertips. Still, he noted that things are better than they used to be. In the past, students had to do almost all calculations in their heads. But since 2016, blind test-takers have been allowed to use a braille notetaker, known as Hansone. \"Just like sighted students write out their calculations in pencil, we enter them in braille on the Hansone to follow the steps,\" he said.\n\nBBC/Hosu Lee Students like Oh Jeong-won must use braille display devices during the exam\n\nAnother student at Hanbit School for the Blind, 18-year-old Oh Jeong-won, who will also sit the Suneung this year, said the late afternoon is \"the hardest point\" of the day. \"Up until lunch, it's manageable,\" he said. \"But around 4 or 5pm, after English and before Korean History, that's when it gets really tough. \"There's no dinner break,\" he explained. \"We're solving problems during the time we would normally eat, so it feels even more exhausting. Still, I keep going because I know there will be a sense of accomplishment at the end.\" For Jeong-won, the fatigue is compounded by the need to stay intensely focused with both his hands and his hearing. \"When I'm reading the braille with my fingers and also taking in information through audio, it feels much more tiring than it does for sighted students,\" he said. But the students say that the length of the exam and the long study hours are not the hardest part. What is most challenging is access to study materials. Popular textbooks and online lectures that sighted students rely on are often out of reach. There are very few braille versions, and converting materials into audio requires having text files - which are difficult to obtain. In many cases, someone has to manually type out entire workbooks to make them usable. Online lectures also pose difficulties, as many instructors explain concepts using visual notes, diagrams and graphics on screen, which cannot be followed through audio alone.\n\nBBC/Hosu Lee Ahead of the Suneung exam, Han Dong-hyun and Oh Jeong-won solve past questions using a screen reader and braille\n\nOne of the most significant barriers, however, is the delay in receiving braille versions of the state-produced EBS preparation books - a core set of materials closely linked to the national exam. Because of this delay, blind students often receive the materials months later than others. \"Sighted students get their EBS books between January and March and study them for the whole year,\" said Jeong-won. \"We receive the braille files only around August or September, when the exam is just a few months away.\" Dong-hyun shared the same concern. \"The braille materials weren't completed until less than 90 days before the exam,\" he said. \"I kept wishing the publication process could be faster.\" The National Institute of Special Education, which produces the braille version of EBS exam materials, told the BBC that the process takes at least three months for each book because it must follow relevant guidelines. The institute added that it is \"making various efforts to ensure that blind students can study without disruption, such as producing and providing the materials in separate volumes.\" The Korean Blind Union said it has long raised this issue with authorities, and plans to file a constitutional petition demanding greater accessibility to braille versions of all textbooks.\n\nBBC/Hosu Lee For blind students, the Suneung exam can last for more than 12 hours",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nEvery year in South Korea, millions of students take a very important test called the Suneung. This exam helps decide which university they can attend and can influence their future jobs and lives. For most students, the exam lasts about eight hours. But for blind students, it can take much longer.\n\n**What happened**\nThis year, more than 550,000 students took the Suneung exam. Blind students, like 18-year-olds Han Dong-hyun and Oh Jeong-won, spend nearly 13 hours taking the test because they need extra time and use braille papers. The braille test booklets are much thicker than normal ones because every word and symbol is in braille. There is no dinner break during the exam, so the students work straight through the day until nearly 10pm.\n\n**Impact**\nThese long hours show the unique challenges blind students face. They must read complicated information by touch and remember details without being able to see or re-read material easily. Although tools like braille notetakers help, blind students still struggle with limited access to study materials. They often get important preparation books much later than other students, making it harder to prepare. This story highlights the efforts to make education fairer for blind students, while also showing where improvements are still needed.\n\n**What's next step**\nGroups representing blind people are pushing the government to provide braille textbooks earlier and improve access to study resources. The National Institute of Special Education is trying to speed up producing braille materials by breaking books into smaller parts. These changes aim to give blind students more equal chances in their education and future careers.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nBlind students in South Korea face a demanding 13-hour exam day, revealing both progress and ongoing challenges in making education accessible to all.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte**\nChaque année en Corée du Sud, des millions d’étudiants passent un examen très important appelé Suneung. Ce test détermine à quelle université ils peuvent aller et influence leur avenir professionnel et personnel. Pour la plupart, l’examen dure environ huit heures. Mais pour les étudiants aveugles, cela prend beaucoup plus de temps.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé**\nCette année, plus de 550 000 étudiants ont passé le Suneung. Les étudiants aveugles, comme Han Dong-hyun et Oh Jeong-won, âgés de 18 ans, passent près de 13 heures à passer le test car ils ont besoin de plus de temps et utilisent des papiers en braille. Les livrets de test en braille sont beaucoup plus épais que les livrets normaux car chaque mot et symbole est en braille. Il n’y a pas de pause dîner, donc les étudiants travaillent sans interruption jusqu’à presque 22 heures.\n\n**Impact**\nCes longues heures montrent les défis uniques auxquels font face les étudiants aveugles. Ils doivent lire des informations compliquées au toucher et retenir les détails sans pouvoir voir ou relire facilement. Même si des outils comme les blocs-notes en braille aident, les étudiants aveugles ont encore un accès limité aux matériaux d’étude. Ils reçoivent souvent les livres de préparation importants bien plus tard que les autres, ce qui complique leur préparation. Cette histoire met en lumière les efforts pour rendre l’éducation plus équitable pour les aveugles, tout en montrant où des améliorations sont encore nécessaires.\n\n**Prochaine étape**\nLes associations représentant les aveugles demandent au gouvernement de fournir les manuels en braille plus tôt et d’améliorer l’accès aux ressources d’étude. L’Institut national d’éducation spécialisée essaie d’accélérer la production des matériaux en braille en divisant les livres en parties plus petites. Ces changements visent à offrir aux étudiants aveugles des chances plus égales dans leurs études et leur avenir professionnel.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase**\nLes étudiants aveugles en Corée du Sud affrontent une journée d’examen de 13 heures, révélant à la fois des progrès et des défis persistants pour rendre l’éducation accessible à tous.\n",

Pero para estudiantes ciegos, puede durar mucho más.\n\n**Qué pasó**\nEste año, más de 550,000 estudiantes tomaron el examen Suneung. Los estudiantes ciegos, como Han Dong-hyun y Oh Jeong-won, de 18 años, pasan casi 13 horas haciendo el examen porque necesitan tiempo extra y usan papeles en braille. Los libros de examen en braille son mucho más gruesos que los normales porque cada palabra y símbolo está en braille. No hay descanso para cenar, así que trabajan sin parar hasta casi las 10 de la noche.\n\n**Impacto**\nEstas largas horas muestran los desafíos únicos que enfrentan los estudiantes ciegos. Deben leer información complicada con el tacto y recordar detalles sin poder ver o releer fácilmente. Aunque herramientas como los cuadernos braille les ayudan, los estudiantes ciegos tienen acceso limitado a materiales de estudio. A menudo reciben los libros de preparación importantes mucho más tarde que otros estudiantes, lo que dificulta su preparación. Esta historia muestra los esfuerzos para hacer la educación más justa para los ciegos, pero también dónde se necesitan mejoras.\n\n**Próximo paso**\nLos grupos que representan a personas ciegas están presionando al gobierno para que entregue los libros en braille más temprano y mejore el acceso a recursos de estudio. El Instituto Nacional de Educación Especial intenta acelerar la producción de materiales en braille dividiendo los libros en partes más pequeñas. Estos cambios buscan dar a los estudiantes ciegos más oportunidades iguales en su educación y carreras futuras.\n\n**Resumen en una frase**\nLos estudiantes ciegos en Corea del Sur enfrentan un día de examen de 13 horas, mostrando tanto avances como desafíos en hacer la educación accesible para todos.\n",

Actualmente, deben asistir en persona para votar, incluso en estas etapas exigentes.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El Parlamento Europeo votó una nueva norma que permitirá a las diputadas en etapa avanzada de embarazo o que acaban de tener un bebé delegar su voto a otro diputado. Este voto por delegación se podrá usar hasta tres meses antes de la fecha prevista de parto y hasta seis meses después del nacimiento. La presidenta del Parlamento, Roberta Metsola, y el ponente, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, explicaron esta medida durante una rueda de prensa el 13 de noviembre de 2025.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta regla ayuda a las mujeres en la política permitiéndoles cuidar su salud y a sus bebés sin perder votos importantes. Apoya la igualdad de género al reconocer las necesidades especiales de las madres embarazadas y recientes en un trabajo exigente. Si todos los países de la UE aprueban esta norma, hará que la participación política sea más justa e inclusiva.\n\n**Próximo paso** – La propuesta debe ser aprobada por unanimidad por todos los países miembros de la UE. Cada país la revisará según sus propias leyes antes de que pueda entrar en vigor. Una vez aprobada, el nuevo sistema de votación se implementará en todo el Parlamento Europeo.\n\n**Frase resumen** – El Parlamento Europeo busca apoyar a las diputadas permitiendo el voto por delegación durante el embarazo avanzado y la maternidad temprana, promoviendo la equidad en la participación política.",
