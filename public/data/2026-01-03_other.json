      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nOur Best of 2025 Education stories reflect a growing global commitment to reimagining how we learn, teach, and grow. These five highlights explore new models, inspiring individuals, and bold ideas that bring equity and creativity into classrooms and beyond.\n\nAt CART High near Fresno, there are no bells, no fights, and no hallways echoing with chaos. Instead, students carry laptops through bright, spacious corridors on their way to classes in biotechnology, forensics, and digital marketing. It looks and feels nothing like a traditional public high school, and that’s precisely the point.\n\nCART, short for Center for Advanced Research and Technology, could represent the future of education in California. As Linda Darling-Hammond, president of the State Board of Education, put it: “The big, old-fashioned factory model of high school—where students run from class to class with a locker as their only stable point of contact—is not succeeding. We need to overhaul the whole idea of what high school can be.”\n\nNow, a new statewide pilot program from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence aims to do just that. Backed by $10 million in state funding, the initiative invites districts to redesign high school and middle school learning, focusing on flexibility, real-world experience, and stronger connections between students, teachers, and communities.\n\nA century-old system ready for change\n\nPublic high schools, as we know them, are barely a century old. Born from early 20th-century industrial ideals, they were designed around efficiency. As many of us know, this resulted in standardized classes, 50-minute periods, and a rigid unit system known as the Carnegie unit. But modern research in adolescent development shows teenagers learn best through autonomy, hands-on projects, and collaboration.\n\n“It should be a joy to go to school every day,” Darling-Hammond said. And at CART, it seems to be. Students don’t memorize facts for tests; they immerse themselves in topics that matter to them. Instead of racing through fragmented classes, they spend three hours per day in interdisciplinary “labs” where English, science, and art intersect.\n\nThis shift is already producing results. Attendance hovers near 100 percent, discipline issues are rare, and over 90 percent of students score proficient in English. Principal Rick Watson says educators from around the world visit to study CART’s model. “Comprehensive high schools don’t work for some B, C, D students,” he explained. “The students have potential, but they’re disconnected. They’re desperate for a different model of education.”\n\nTeaching that sparks curiosity\n\nAt CART, the focus is on engagement and deep, not rote, learning. English teacher Emily Saeteurn explains: “We work really hard to get kids to see the bigger picture of why they’re learning what they’re learning. We want them to have that ‘aha!’ moment.”\n\nBiotechnology students read The Andromeda Strain and The Martian before writing their own science fiction stories based on real genetic concepts. In law and policy, teens read Othello and Hamlet before staging mock trials of Shakespearean characters. The approach makes academics tangible and relevant.\n\nSenior Madelyn Quiroga says she struggled at her traditional high school but thrives at CART. “At my other school, they just throw stuff at you and never really explain it. Here, they actually teach us, and it’s all stuff we actually want to know,” she said. “Like when I hear someone talk about CRISPR, it’s like, ‘Oh, I know something about that.’”\n\nHer classmate Audrey Riede, studying law, says she now hopes to become a defense attorney. “CART is way better than normal school,” she said. “The teachers aren’t just trying to get you to pass; they really want to make you think.”\n\nChallenges ahead for reform\n\nThe state faces major hurdles in expanding CART’s success. Colleges still rely on the A-G course requirements and traditional letter grades for admissions, leaving little flexibility for innovative coursework. The Carnegie unit, which ties credits to time spent in class rather than mastery, remains deeply embedded in both high school and university systems.\n\nEven the Carnegie Foundation has urged reforms, advocating for progress-based measures over time-based ones. But as of now, most higher education institutions remain reluctant to change.\n\nStill, advocates like Russlynn Ali, head of the XQ Institute and former U.S. Department of Education official, believe the momentum is shifting. “There are young people today who’ve graduated from high school but can’t calculate the tip on a split bill or grasp the main idea in an op-ed piece,” she said. “The case for change is unmistakable.”\n\nA model of possibility\n\nCART’s success story began 25 years ago as a partnership between Clovis Unified and Fresno Unified, designed to help struggling students connect learning to real careers. Today, it serves 1,000 juniors and seniors each year, nearly 80 percent from low-income families. The school’s popularity continues to grow. Last year, more than twice as many students applied as there were spots available.\n\nAs California prepares to announce the winning redesign proposals, CART’s bright yellow halls stand as a living example of what education could be: a place where learning feels relevant, curiosity thrives, and every student, from the A student to the “C kid”, finds a reason to show up.\n\nDid this solution from 2025 stand out to you?

      "personality_title": "California's CART High shows a new way to learn and succeed",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Traditional high schools in the U.S. were designed about 100 years ago to be like factories, with students moving quickly from one class to another and learning mostly by memorizing. Experts now say this old model doesn’t work well because teenagers learn better when they have more freedom and work on hands-on projects.\n\n**What happened** – Near Fresno, California, CART High (Center for Advanced Research and Technology) offers a different style of education. Instead of bells and strict schedules, students spend long blocks of time in labs that combine subjects like science, art, and English. They learn by doing real-world projects, such as writing science fiction based on genetics or acting out trials from Shakespeare plays. This approach has helped students stay interested, attend school regularly, and perform better academically. CART serves about 1,000 juniors and seniors, most coming from low-income families.\n\n**Impact** – CART’s model shows that school can be a place where students enjoy learning and connect what they study to real life. Attendance is almost perfect, discipline problems are rare, and over 90% of students meet grade-level standards in English. This success has caught the attention of educators worldwide and inspired a $10 million California state program to redesign schools with similar ideas. CART especially helps students who struggle in regular schools by giving them meaningful and engaging learning experiences.\n\n**What's next step** – California is testing new ways to change high schools across the state based on CART’s ideas. However, challenges remain, such as how colleges accept students and how schools measure learning by time instead of understanding. Still, with growing support, this approach might spread and change how many students learn in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – CART High’s hands-on, flexible learning shows a practical path to making high school more engaging and effective for all students.\n",

Les experts disent aujourd’hui que ce modèle ancien ne fonctionne pas bien car les adolescents apprennent mieux en ayant plus de liberté et en réalisant des projets pratiques.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Près de Fresno, en Californie, le lycée CART (Centre de Recherche et Technologie Avancée) propose un style d’enseignement différent. Au lieu de sonneries et d’horaires stricts, les élèves passent de longues périodes dans des laboratoires qui combinent des matières comme les sciences, l’art et l’anglais. Ils apprennent en réalisant des projets concrets, comme écrire des histoires de science-fiction basées sur la génétique ou jouer des procès tirés des pièces de Shakespeare. Cette méthode aide les élèves à rester motivés, à venir à l’école régulièrement et à mieux réussir. CART accueille environ 1 000 élèves de première et terminale, dont la plupart viennent de familles à faibles revenus.\n\n**Impact** – Le modèle de CART montre que l’école peut être un lieu où les élèves aiment apprendre et relient leurs études à la vie réelle. La présence est presque parfaite, les problèmes de discipline sont rares, et plus de 90 % des élèves atteignent les niveaux requis en anglais. Ce succès a attiré l’attention des enseignants dans le monde entier et inspiré un programme californien de 10 millions de dollars pour réinventer les écoles avec des idées similaires. CART aide particulièrement les élèves en difficulté dans les écoles classiques en leur offrant des expériences d’apprentissage intéressantes et utiles.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – La Californie teste de nouvelles façons de transformer les lycées dans tout l’État en s’inspirant des idées de CART. Cependant, des défis restent, comme la façon dont les universités acceptent les élèves et comment les écoles évaluent l’apprentissage par le temps au lieu de la compréhension.

      "content": "Did Sahelanthropus , which lived 7 million years ago, walk on two legs like a modern human? It's complicated\n\nSahelanthropus fossils (centre) compared with a chimpanzee (left) and a human (right) Wiliams et al., Sci. Adv. 12, eadv0130\n\nA long-running and bitterly fought dispute over whether the earliest known hominin had a knuckle-walking gait, like chimpanzees, or walked upright, like humans, may have been settled – but not everyone is convinced.\n\nScott Williams at New York University and his colleagues say that reanalysis of fossil remains of Sahelanthropus tchadensis shows it had at least three key anatomical features that together show that it was our earliest known hominin ancestor to be bipedal.\n\nIt has, however, been a lengthy journey to reach this point.\n\nThe 7-million-year-old fossil skull, teeth and a jawbone of Sahelanthropus tchadensis were first described in 2002, following their discovery in the desert region of Chad, in north-central Africa. With a pronounced brow ridge and small canines, the ancient animal was immediately recognised as being unlike great apes.\n\nThe anatomy of the skull showed that it likely sat directly on top of the spine, similar to the condition seen in other upright-walking, bipedal hominins.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThen, in 2004, French scientists identified a femur – a thigh bone – and ulna – a forearm bone – that had also been found alongside the skull fossils in Chad as belonging to Sahelanthropus. However, it wasn’t until 2020 that the researchers published their findings, arguing that the femur was curved in a way that resembled that of a non-bipedal great ape.\n\nThe debate has swung back and forth ever since. For example, in 2022, a research team including Franck Guy and Guillaume Daver, both at the University of Poitiers in France, argued that certain anatomical traits on the femur indicated bipedality. In 2024, meanwhile, Clément Zanolli at the University of Bordeaux in France and his colleagues argued that Guy and Daver’s team was wrong, because those supposedly bipedal anatomical traits could also be seen in non-bipedal great apes.\n\nWilliams, the lead author of the most recent study, says he entered this scientific fray with a “fairly ambiguous” opinion of Sahelanthropus.\n\nHe and his colleagues first looked at the point on the femur where the gluteus maximus muscle had once attached to the bone. They found that this attachment point looked similar to those seen on hominin thighbones.\n\nThey also analysed the size and shape of the femur and ulna. Although both are similar in size to the equivalent bones in chimpanzees, their proportions were more aligned with those of a hominin.\n\nFinally, they identified a previously overlooked feature in the Sahelanthropus femur called a “femoral tubercle”.\n\n“I actually initially identified it by touch, then confirmed it visually using 3D scans of the fossil,” says Williams. “It’s a small bump that sits only where the femoral tubercle would be; the area is smooth in apes and other non-bipeds, but it has a major function.\n\n“It serves as the attachment point of the iliofemoral ligament, the largest and most powerful ligament in the human body. That ligament is loose when we’re sitting but tightens around the femoral head to hold it in the hip joint when we stand and walk, preventing our torso from falling backwards or sideways.”\n\nWilliams, however, doubts the new research will fully settle the argument about how Sahelanthropus moved.\n\n“We’re fairly convinced that Sahelanthropus was an early bipedal hominin at this point, but I’d be foolish to think we ended the debate.”\n\nGuy and Daver, who argued that the hominin was bipedal in 2022, released a joint statement to New Scientist in response to the new paper.\n\n“It not only confirms our initial interpretations of the adaptations and locomotion of the earliest hominin Sahelanthropus but also puts forward new arguments supporting its terrestrial habitual bipedalism, despite an overall morphology that remains close to that of a great ape,” the researchers say.\n\nBut they also acknowledge that only the discovery of new remains will conclusively end the debate.\n\nJohn Hawks at the University of Wisconsin-Madison says he agrees with the new findings and says they point to a complicated origin for the hominin lineage.\n\n“I think it may be misleading to imagine that Sahelanthropus are all hominin or all ape,” Hawks says. “Our evolution started as a fuzzy, gradual set of changes towards more upright posture and movement, and Sahelanthropus had features that help us to understand those changes.”\n\nZanolli, who has strongly argued that Sahelanthropus was not bipedal, disputes the new paper’s findings, saying that “most, if not all, of the results point toward similarities with the African great apes”.\n\n“In my view, this new study simply confirms that Sahelanthropus long bones resemble those of the African great apes, and that it was probably behaving in ways that could range anywhere in between those of a chimpanzee and a gorilla, but clearly differed from the habitual bipedalism as known in Australopithecus and Homo,” says Zanolli.\n\nJournal reference: Science Advances DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adv0130",

Now there are only six of the EU’s member states, among them Sweden, that do not have the euro.\n\nStockholm – Bulgaria has introduced the euro as its currency, almost 20 years after the country joined the EU. The transition from the Bulgarian currency lev took place at the turn of the year.\n\nSeveral of the country’s governments have advocated that the country should join the euro, in the hope that it will stimulate the economy. Bulgaria is the EU’s poorest member state. But there is concern among Bulgarians that the introduction may lead to higher prices and increase political instability in the country.\n\nWith Bulgaria’s entry into the euro, only six of the EU’s 27 countries now remain outside the monetary union: Sweden, Poland, Czechia, Hungary, Romania and Denmark.\n\n(2 January)",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Bulgaria has been a member of the European Union (EU) for nearly 20 years but until now used its own money called the lev. Many countries in the EU use the euro, a shared currency meant to make trade and travel easier.\n\n**What happened** – At the start of 2026, Bulgaria officially switched from the lev to the euro. This means people and businesses in Bulgaria now use the euro for all their money needs. Bulgaria is the poorest country in the EU, and several past governments pushed for this change to help the economy.\n\n**Impact** – Using the euro can make it easier for Bulgaria to trade with other EU countries and attract investment. It could help the country’s economy grow and become more stable. However, some people worry that prices might go up or that the change could cause political problems. Still, this switch shows Bulgaria becoming more connected with the rest of Europe.\n\n**What's next step** – Now that Bulgaria uses the euro, only six EU countries remain without it: Sweden, Poland, Czechia, Hungary, Romania, and Denmark. These countries might watch Bulgaria’s experience to decide if they want to join the euro in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Bulgaria’s move to the euro marks a major step in joining the EU’s economic group, aiming to boost growth and strengthen ties with Europe.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – La Bulgarie est membre de l’Union européenne (UE) depuis près de 20 ans, mais utilisait jusqu’à présent sa propre monnaie, le lev. Beaucoup de pays de l’UE utilisent l’euro, une monnaie commune qui facilite le commerce et les déplacements.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Au début de 2026, la Bulgarie est officiellement passée du lev à l’euro. Cela signifie que les habitants et les entreprises bulgares utilisent désormais l’euro pour toutes leurs transactions. La Bulgarie est le pays le plus pauvre de l’UE, et plusieurs gouvernements précédents ont soutenu ce changement pour aider l’économie.\n\n**Impact** – Utiliser l’euro peut faciliter les échanges commerciaux avec les autres pays de l’UE et attirer des investissements. Cela pourrait aider l’économie bulgare à croître et à devenir plus stable. Cependant, certains craignent une hausse des prix ou des problèmes politiques. Pourtant, ce changement montre que la Bulgarie se rapproche davantage de l’Europe.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Maintenant que la Bulgarie utilise l’euro, il ne reste plus que six pays de l’UE sans cette monnaie : la Suède, la Pologne, la Tchéquie, la Hongrie, la Roumanie et le Danemark. Ces pays pourraient observer l’expérience bulgare pour décider s’ils veulent adopter l’euro à l’avenir.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le passage de la Bulgarie à l’euro est une étape importante pour rejoindre le groupe économique de l’UE, visant à stimuler la croissance et renforcer les liens avec l’Europe.\n",
