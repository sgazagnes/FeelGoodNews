Visit locss.org to contact the team or to get involved! Grant Parkins, 2018\n\nVolunteers participating in the Lake Observations by Citizen Scientists and Satellites (LOCSS) project have been collecting water level data in lakes since 2017. Now, the LOCSS team has used these data to examine the accuracy of water level measurements made from space. The results, published in GIScience & Remote Sensing, showed that modern satellites with special instruments called nadir altimeters can capture water level variation with relatively high accuracy even for lakes smaller than one square kilometer. These measurements are crucial for scientific research and resource management.\n\n“We can look at the wetland now with different eyes,” said Nelsi Durán, a volunteer from Ciénaga La Musanda, Colombia. (Translated from Spanish).\n\nThe work done by LOCSS volunteers also helped reveal where satellite-based lake water level measurements can go wrong. Water level variability turns out to be an important factor. Relatively small lakes with a high lake level variability can be measured from space, but lakes where the water level seldom changes yielded measurements with lower accuracy.\n\nThe LOCSS project has included 274 lakes in 10 countries (USA, Canada, Colombia, Chile, Kenya, Spain, France, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh), so far. Since the project started, more than 10,000 citizen scientists have reported water level measurements to the project.\n\n“We chose to work with the LOCSS team, because it is important for us to try to widen our understanding of how our environments change over time,” said Dan Grigas, an ecologist at Forest Preserve District, DuPage County, Illinois. “This includes how changes in climate patterns in both the near-term and long-term can affect freshwater ecology. This program also allows for and relies on citizen scientists to participate, which strengthens the relationships among government agencies, the people they serve, and the environments that we all treasure.”\n\nAre you passionate about understanding our planet and its precious water resources?

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Since 2017, a project called Lake Observations by Citizen Scientists and Satellites (LOCSS) has invited volunteers around the world to measure water levels in lakes. This helps scientists check how well satellites can track lake water levels from space.\n\n**What happened** – LOCSS volunteers collected water level data from 274 lakes in 10 countries, including the USA, Colombia, and India. Using these volunteer reports, the LOCSS team studied how accurate satellite instruments called nadir altimeters are when measuring lake heights. They found satellites can measure changes in small lakes, even those less than one square kilometer in size, quite well, especially when lake water levels change often.\n\n**Impact** – This work shows satellites can monitor small lakes better than previously thought. It also reveals that lakes with little change in water level are harder to measure accurately from space. These findings help scientists improve how they track freshwater resources and understand environmental changes, like those caused by climate shifts.\n\n**What's next step** – The LOCSS project encourages more people to join and submit lake data. With more volunteer measurements, scientists can keep improving satellite monitoring and better protect freshwater ecosystems around the world.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Volunteer-collected lake data are helping NASA improve satellite monitoring of small lakes, supporting better environmental research and water resource management worldwide.",

      "title": "How to Recycle Makeup",
      "summary": "Makeup is making the planet ugly. The beauty industry generates approximately 120 billion packaging items...\nThe post How to Recycle Makeup appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "Makeup is making the planet ugly. The beauty industry generates approximately 120 billion packaging items annually, most of which end up in landfills. Most beauty packaging is too small, made of mixed materials, or too flexible to be accepted by municipal curbside recycling programs. Compacts, lipstick tubes, mascara wands, pumps, and travel-size containers are typically not accepted at standard recycling facilities.\n\nA growing number of brands, retailers, and nonprofit organizations have responded by creating specialized recycling programs for hard-to-recycle beauty packaging. This shift reflects increasing corporate awareness of the industry’s environmental impact—and presents an opportunity for consumers to support companies that take responsibility for their products throughout their life cycles.\n\nBefore diving into recycling options, consider purging your makeup collection first. Empty out every bag, drawer, suitcase, and purse: no compact left behind. First, determine what’s no longer needed. Check expiration dates and color-match everything. A clean and safe makeup collection requires staying up to date on everything in it.\n\nGet Ready To Recycle Makeup\n\nStart with that old makeup at the back of the drawer or the bottom of the bag. Maybe it came as a freebie, maybe it’s been years since that bronzer saw the light of day, or maybe a color just never worked. Whatever the case, most people have items they’ve kept around for some reason.\n\nIf products are gently used or unopened and still within their shelf life, look up local women’s shelters. Many accept cosmetics donations, sanitize them, and distribute them to women who otherwise couldn’t afford them. Organizations like Project Glimmer also distribute beauty products to underserved women and girls.\n\nFor products that are definitely used or empty, check whether the brand has a recycling program. If no buy-back option exists, consider reusing the container—clean it thoroughly and repurpose it for storage, DIY projects, or offer it to someone who makes their own cosmetics.\n\nOnce reuse options are exhausted, recycling programs can ensure packaging doesn’t end up in a landfill. The options available have expanded significantly, with Pact Collective now offering drop-off locations and multiple brands operating take-back programs.\n\nPreparing Empties for Drop-Off\n\nAll packaging must be clean and empty. Contaminated items, that is, packaging with product residue, cannot be recycled and will be sent to waste-to-energy instead. By cleaning empties thoroughly, consumers increase the likelihood that packaging will be mechanically recycled into new products.\n\nSave at least 5 empties before cleaning to reduce water usage.\n\nDisassemble caps, pumps, and closures to clean each component\n\nSoak items in hot, soapy water rather than running them under hot water continuously.\n\nUse straw brushes for small openings, such as mascara tubes.\n\nCut open flexible tubes to thoroughly clean the inside.\n\nDrop items into bins unbagged.\n\nCheck Local Recycling Options\n\nMunicipal recycling rules and what is accepted still vary significantly by location. Before assuming packaging must go to a specialized program, check what your local program accepts. Some cities now accept all plastics regardless of resin code, while others remain limited to #1 and #2 containers. Use Earth911’s Recycling Search to find recycling options near you, including both curbside programs and specialized drop-off locations.\n\nSend these items through your curbside recycling bin:\n\nRigid plastic containers #1, #2, and #5\n\nStainless steel or aluminum containers\n\nClear or frosted glass jars and bottles (check local guidelines)\n\nHazardous materials that require special disposal (check Earth911 for household hazardous waste locations):\n\nAerosol products\n\nNail polish and nail polish remover\n\nPressurized containers\n\nPact Collective: Industry-Wide Beauty Recycling\n\nPact Collective is a nonprofit organization founded in 2021 by MOB Beauty and Credo Beauty to collect beauty packaging waste across the industry. Now with over 150 member companies, including L’Oréal, Sephora, Ulta Beauty, ILIA, and Summer Fridays, Pact represents a significant shift toward collective corporate responsibility.\n\nPact is brand-agnostic: any beauty packaging that meets Pact’s collection guidelines can be dropped off, regardless of whether the brand is a Pact member. This approach prioritizes volume collection over brand loyalty, making participation straightforward for consumers.\n\nPact Drop-Off Locations\n\nPact maintains over 3,300 collection bin locations across North America at major beauty retailers:\n\nUlta Beauty : All 1,350+ U.S. locations through The Beauty Dropoff program, the largest beauty packaging collection program by door count in the country\n\n: All 1,350+ U.S. locations through The Beauty Dropoff program, the largest beauty packaging collection program by door count in the country Sephora : All 600+ North American stores through the Beauty (Re)Purposed program\n\n: All 600+ North American stores through the Beauty (Re)Purposed program Credo Beauty : All locations (Credo is a Pact co-founder and contributes roughly 50% of material collected from in-store bins despite representing only 1% of Pact’s bin footprint)\n\n: All locations (Credo is a Pact co-founder and contributes roughly 50% of material collected from in-store bins despite representing only 1% of Pact’s bin footprint) L’Occitane en Provence : Participating stores\n\n: Participating stores Saks Fifth Avenue : Participating stores\n\n: Participating stores Nordstrom Rack : Participating stores\n\n: Participating stores ILIA and Fenty Beauty: Select locations\n\nWhat Pact Accepts\n\nHard-to-recycle beauty packaging smaller than a fist:\n\nMascara tubes and wands\n\nLipstick tubes and lip gloss containers\n\nCompact cases and palettes\n\nEyeliner pencils and containers\n\nFoundation bottles and tubes\n\nSmall skincare containers\n\nPumps, caps, and closures\n\nFlexible tubes (squeezable packaging)\n\nPact Mail-Back Program\n\nConsumers without access to a drop-off bin can use the Pact paid mail-back program. The service costs $5 for a prepaid shipping label, and some partner brands offer discount codes to help offset the cost. Pact encourages using in-store bins when possible, as bulk shipping is more environmentally efficient than individual mail-back packages.\n\nBrand Take-Back Programs\n\nSeveral beauty brands operate their own recycling programs, reflecting growing recognition that companies bear responsibility for their packaging through the end of life. Supporting brands with take-back programs sends a market signal that sustainability matters to consumers.\n\nMAC Cosmetics: Back 2 MAC\n\nOne of the longest-running beauty recycling programs, Back 2 MAC has operated for over 30 years. Return clean, empty MAC packaging in-store or online for recycling through a partnership with Close the Loop. MAC’s signature black plastic is processed through a closed-loop system and remanufactured into new MAC compacts. Items not eligible include liquid lipsticks, glitters, pigments, fragrances, nail lacquers, and aerosols. The program is not available in California due to local regulations.\n\nLush: Bring It Back\n\nLush operates a closed-loop recycling system for their iconic black polypropylene pots. Return clean #5 PP plastic pots (4.5g/1.5oz and larger), including makeup packaging like mascara tubes and lip tubes, to any Lush store. In exchange, receive $1 off per item returned, or bring five items for a free fresh face mask. The returned plastic is shredded, washed, pelletized, and remolded into new Lush pots. In 2024, Lush’s Green Hub processed over 1,700 tons of waste, with an 18% return rate on pots produced—up from 15% the previous year.\n\nTerraCycle Programs\n\nTerraCycle partners with brands and retailers to offer beauty packaging recycling through both free brand-sponsored programs and paid Zero Waste Boxes. Free programs are available through brands including Burt’s Bees, Farmacy, Bliss, and LimeLife by Alcone. Retailers like Nordstrom’s BEAUTYCYCLE program and Saks Fifth Avenue partner with TerraCycle to collect and process makeup packaging through in-store and mail-in programs.\n\nAccording to TerraCycle’s life-cycle analysis, their beauty waste recycling process is 74% better for the environment than landfills and 67% better than waste-to-energy, with 98% of collected waste recycled.\n\nBuying Responsibly\n\nThe biggest lesson in makeup disposal is how products get there in the first place. The most important step you can take to reduce beauty packaging waste happens when you make a purchase. Choose brands that take responsibility for their environmental impact:\n\nChoose refillable packaging: Many brands now offer refill options for foundations, lipsticks, and compacts. Purchasing refills instead of entirely new packaging significantly reduces waste.\n\nLook for packaging-free products: Solid shampoo bars, bar cleansers, and other “naked” products eliminate packaging entirely. Lush pioneered this approach, with 30-50% of their products sold without packaging, and many other brands now offer solid alternatives.\n\nSupport Pact Collective members: Brands that are Pact members have committed to improving packaging sustainability and funding collection programs. The organization’s 150+ members include L’Oréal, Credo Beauty, Summer Fridays, ILIA, Fenty Beauty, and many indie brands.\n\nConsider mono-material packaging: Products packaged in a single material type (like all-polypropylene containers) are easier to recycle than mixed-material packaging with metal springs, multiple plastic types, or glass-and-plastic combinations.\n\nUse what you have: Before buying new products, use the ones you already have completely. Check expiration dates on current makeup and finish products before replacing them.\n\nMakeup recycling options have expanded considerably. With Pact Collective’s 3,300+ bin locations at major retailers and its multiple brand take-back programs, there are more pathways to keep cosmetics packaging out of landfills. Remember the key steps:\n\nClean empties thoroughly, check what’s accepted by the recycling program, and drop off or mail back.\n\nFor curbside-recyclable items (larger containers in #1, #2, or #5 plastic), use your municipal recycling program.\n\nFor hard-to-recycle items smaller than a fist, Pact offers the most accessible solution.\n\nThe growing range of recycling options reflects the beauty industry’s increasing awareness of its environmental impact. Supporting brands and retailers that invest in take-back programs, collection infrastructure, and circular packaging design helps accelerate this shift, making it easier for everyone to be a friend of the planet, and that’s beautiful.\n\nEditor’s Note: This article was originally published on January 2, 2017, and we most recently updated in December 2025.

Estas reglas ayudan a guiar las prácticas agrícolas y a proporcionar ayuda financiera.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El 10 de noviembre de 2025, el Parlamento Europeo aprobó con gran mayoría nuevas reglas para los agricultores. Estos cambios facilitan que los agricultores cumplan con la PAC, aumentan el apoyo financiero a las pequeñas granjas de 2.500 € a 3.000 € al año, y añaden un pago único de hasta 75.000 € para ayudar a desarrollar negocios agrícolas. Las nuevas reglas también protegen las tierras clasificadas como arables aunque no se labren cada año y simplifican las inspecciones ambientales para los agricultores orgánicos. Las inspecciones se reducirán a una sola visita anual.\n\n**Impacto** – Estas actualizaciones ayudan a los agricultores al reducir el papeleo y darles más dinero, especialmente a las pequeñas granjas. Al mismo tiempo, las reglas apoyan el medio ambiente al proteger la biodiversidad de las tierras agrícolas y fomentar la agricultura orgánica. Este equilibrio ayuda a los agricultores a ganarse la vida cuidando la tierra.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El Consejo de la Unión Europea debe aprobar formalmente las nuevas reglas. Una vez aprobadas y publicadas en el Diario Oficial de la UE, entrarán en vigor al día siguiente.\n\n**Mensaje en una frase** – La UE ha aprobado reglas agrícolas más claras y simples que aumentan el apoyo a los agricultores y protegen el medio ambiente al mismo tiempo.",

      "personality_title": "Sailing cargo ships set to reduce pollution in global shipping by 2026",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – International shipping is responsible for about 3 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions contribute to climate change, making the shipping industry one of the more polluting sectors globally.\n\n**What happened** – Starting in 2026, new sailing cargo ships will begin trips from France to the United States. These ships will use wind power instead of relying solely on engines that burn fossil fuels. Some of these ships will sail under the French flag, marking a significant step for France in cleaner shipping.\n\n**Impact** – Using wind to move cargo ships is a new idea for such large-scale shipping. This approach could greatly lower the pollution caused by moving goods across oceans. If successful, it could encourage big shipping companies to adopt cleaner technologies, reducing emissions from a sector that has been hard to clean up.\n\n**What's next step** – The main challenge is whether shipping companies will support and invest in sailing cargo ships. The trips starting in 2026 will provide important information about how well these ships work and if they can be a practical alternative for the industry.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Starting in 2026, sailing cargo ships from France to the U.S. will test a cleaner way to carry goods across oceans, aiming to cut pollution from shipping.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Le transport maritime international représente environ 3 % des émissions mondiales de gaz à effet de serre. Ces émissions contribuent au changement climatique, ce qui fait du secteur maritime l’un des plus polluants.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – À partir de 2026, de nouveaux cargos à voile partiront de France vers les États-Unis. Ces navires utiliseront la force du vent au lieu de moteurs fonctionnant aux combustibles fossiles. Certains de ces cargos navigueront sous pavillon français, marquant une avancée importante pour la France dans le transport maritime plus propre.\n\n**Impact** – Utiliser le vent pour faire avancer des cargos de cette taille est une idée nouvelle à grande échelle. Cette méthode pourrait fortement réduire la pollution liée au transport de marchandises par mer. Si cela fonctionne, cela pourrait encourager les grandes compagnies maritimes à adopter des technologies plus écologiques.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le principal défi est de savoir si les entreprises maritimes soutiendront et investiront dans ces cargos à voile. Les voyages débutant en 2026 permettront de tester leur efficacité et leur viabilité.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Dès 2026, des cargos à voile relieront la France aux États-Unis pour tester un moyen plus propre de transporter des marchandises et réduire la pollution maritime.\n",
