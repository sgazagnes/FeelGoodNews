      "title": "Immune cells use a surprising trick to heal muscle faster",
      "summary": "A research team has found that specific immune cells can connect with muscle fibers in a lightning-fast, neuron-like way to promote healing. These cells deliver quick pulses of calcium, triggering repair within seconds. The mechanism works in both injury and disease models. The discovery could inspire new treatments for muscle recovery and degeneration.",
      "content": "At the cellular scale, the way muscle tissue repairs itself becomes surprisingly complex. The body does not respond the same way to all forms of damage. A sudden muscle tear from a sports injury differs greatly from the slow decline in muscle strength seen in conditions such as muscular dystrophy.\n\nA research team at Cincinnati Children's has uncovered a shared and unexpected repair process that may help the body recover from several kinds of muscle damage. The findings were published online on Nov. 21, 2025, in Current Biology. The project was led by first author Gyanesh Tripathi, PhD, and corresponding author Michael Jankowski, PhD, who oversees the Research Division in Cincinnati Children's Department of Anesthesia and serves as Associate Director of Basic Science Research for the Pediatric Pain Research Center.\n\nThe newly identified mechanism involves macrophages, a type of immune cell. These cells are usually known for acting like tiny cleanup crews that remove bacteria, dead cells, and other unwanted material.\n\nA Neuron-Like Repair Signal\n\n\"The biggest surprise about this was finding that a macrophage has a synaptic-like property that delivers an ion to a muscle fiber to facilitate its repair after an injury,\" Jankowski says. \"It's literally like the way a neuron works, and it's working in an extremely fast synaptic-like fashion to regulate repair.\"\n\nScientists have long known that macrophages respond to muscle injury by releasing cytokines and chemokines that create inflammation, influence pain, and help drive the growth and regeneration of muscle fibers.\n\nSearching for Pain Relief Leads to a Different Breakthrough\n\nThe research team originally aimed to uncover ways to ease pain during recovery after surgery. They were looking for clues that could eventually reduce the need for pain medications that carry significant side effects.\n\nAlthough they did not find a new approach for pain relief, they identified a process that makes muscle repair occur more quickly. This discovery may support the development of future treatments for muscle wasting and acute injuries. The findings also suggest that macrophages might eventually serve as specialized \"delivery vehicles\" for cell-based therapies targeting a wider range of medical conditions.\n\n\"These are infiltrating macrophages, a very specific type. They're not ones already residing in the tissue. These come in after damage occurs,\" Jankowski says.\n\nReal-Time Evidence of Rapid Muscle Activation\n\nIn experiments that used mouse models of two different injury types, researchers examined how macrophages interact with the myofibers that form muscle tissue. They were even able to capture key moments of this activity as it occurred.\n\nBy using brief bursts of a designer chemical to activate the macrophages, the team observed these immune cells forming synaptic-like contacts with myofibers. The macrophages then released calcium ions directly to the muscle fibers, accelerating early stages of healing. Within 10 to 30 seconds, the researchers measured bursts of electrical activity inside the damaged muscle.\n\n\"This occurs in a very rapid fashion. You can activate the macrophage and make the muscle twitch subtly almost immediately,\" Jankowski says.\n\nHealing Effects Seen in Both Injury and Disease Models\n\nThe same type of macrophage-driven signaling also helped mice with disease-like muscle damage. After recognizing the injury, the immune cells gathered at the site and triggered waves of activity in the muscle fibers. After 10 days, mice that received this treatment had substantially more new muscle fibers than mice in the control group.\n\n\"A similar synaptic-like response worked in both scenarios,\" Jankowski says.\n\nNext Research Steps\n\nMore work is needed to determine whether human macrophages behave the same way when muscle is injured. If they do, researchers will still need to learn how to guide or control the process in ways that could be safely used as therapy.\n\nThe team is also interested in an unexpected outcome: although the infiltrating macrophages sped up healing, they did not appear to reduce acute pain. Understanding why this occurs may help explain why about 20% of children who undergo surgery continue to experience lingering pain afterward.\n\nLooking ahead, the researchers want to explore whether macrophages can deliver other helpful signals or materials to muscle cells.\n\nCincinnati Children's co-authors include Adam Dourson, PhD, Fabian Montecino-Morales, PhD, Jennifer Wayland, MS, Sahana Khanna, Megan Hofmann, Hima Bindu Durumutla, MS, Thirupugal Govindarajan, PhD, Luis Queme, MD, PhD, and Douglas Millay, PhD.

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn a sweeping expansion of women’s health services, the National Health Service (NHS) made the morning-after pill available for free across nearly 10,000 pharmacies in England. The change, which began this week, means anyone who needs emergency contraception can walk into their local pharmacy and receive it at no cost, no doctor’s appointment or clinic visit required.\n\nPreviously, access to free emergency contraception depended heavily on local health authority arrangements, creating what advocates called a “postcode lottery.” In some areas, pharmacies charged as much as £30 (about $38 USD) for the pill, forcing many to navigate complex systems or pay out of pocket for timely care.\n\n“This expansion is one of the biggest changes to sexual health services since the 1960s,” said Dr. Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women’s health. “Instead of trying to search for women’s services or explain their needs, from today women can just pop into their local pharmacy and get the oral emergency contraceptive pill free of charge without needing to make an appointment.”\n\nBringing care closer to home\n\nWith four in five people in England living within a 20-minute walk of a pharmacy, the NHS hopes this shift will make reproductive care faster, fairer, and easier to access. The move aligns with the NHS’s 10-year health plan, which emphasizes shifting more care into local communities.\n\n“This service is another example of how the NHS is already delivering on our commitment to bring care into the heart of communities,” Mann added.\n\nThe expansion coincides with another key initiative: individuals newly prescribed antidepressants can now seek medication advice and lifestyle support directly from their local pharmacist. Together, the changes aim to make pharmacies a stronger front line for accessible, stigma-free health services.\n\nEnding the postcode lottery\n\nThe policy has been widely welcomed by pharmacists and women’s health advocates. Henry Gregg, chief executive of the National Pharmacy Association, said the rollout was long overdue. “We’ve long called for the national commissioning of emergency contraception,” he said. “For too long, access to free emergency contraception has been a postcode lottery for patients, with local arrangements only existing in certain parts of the country.”\n\nHowever, Gregg also emphasized the need for sustainable funding. “It’s really important that pharmacies, who are under significant pressure and closing in record numbers, are sustainably funded so they can continue to provide services like these,” he added.\n\nA major step for women’s autonomy\n\nThe move has been hailed as a milestone in reproductive rights and equality. Stephen Kinnock, minister for care, described it as “a major step forward that removes barriers of access to reproductive care that have let women down for too long.”\n\n“Pharmacies play a central role in communities, trusted by local people and easy to access,” Kinnock said. “That’s why it’s vital there are a wide range of services and medications available.”\n\nAs England becomes one of the few nations to make emergency contraception universally free through pharmacies, advocates hope this model will inspire similar reforms in other parts of the UK and beyond. For many, it’s a simple but transformative step toward ensuring that reproductive healthcare is a right, not a privilege.",

      "summary": "Scientists are uncovering what makes some carcinomas so resistant: their ability to change identity. Two new studies reveal crucial proteins and structures that could become targets for future therapies. These discoveries deepen understanding of how tumors reprogram themselves and point toward highly specific treatments. The work raises hopes for safer, more selective cancer drugs.",
      "content": "Some tumors remain extremely difficult to treat, and carcinomas are among the most challenging. Unlike many other cancers, these tumors can behave unpredictably. Some even shift their appearance and begin to resemble entirely different types of cells found in the human body, such as those in the skin. This unusual ability makes many current treatments far less effective.\n\n\"The tumors are notoriously plastic in their cellular identity,\" says Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor Christopher Vakoc. In some cases, this shifting identity helps the cancer avoid therapies designed to destroy it.\n\nNew Research Reveals Hidden Weaknesses\n\nRecent studies from the Vakoc lab provide important insights into two of these difficult carcinomas. According to Vakoc, the new work exposes weaknesses that could \"tee up targets for therapy.\"\n\nIn research published in Nature Communications, CSHL scientists identified a protein that determines whether pancreatic cancer cells retain their traditional appearance or begin to adopt features similar to skin cells. In a separate study in Cell Reports, the team mapped the crystal structure of another group of proteins that is essential in tuft cell lung cancer.\n\nLinking Past Discoveries to New Therapeutic Possibilities\n\nVakoc describes this latest development as a full-circle moment for the lab. When tuft cell lung cancer was first identified in 2018, he and his colleagues were searching for epigenetic influences that promote tumor growth. They focused on the mechanisms of transcription and gene regulation rather than the genes themselves. Now, working with CSHL Director of Research Leemor Joshua-Tor, the researchers have uncovered a finding that may eventually lead to an epigenetic therapy capable of halting cancer growth.\n\nThese two studies support a long-standing mission in Vakoc's research program. \"We aim to identify the master regulators of cellular identity,\" he says. Scientists hope that these \"master regulators\" could one day serve as the basis for new treatments, similar to the hormone therapies now used for breast and prostate cancers that were once much harder to manage. Although promising, Vakoc notes that this goal will require more time and continued study.\n\nToward Safer and More Precise Cancer Treatments\n\nIf future medicines emerge from these findings, Vakoc hopes they will be designed to target cancer cells while protecting the rest of the body. That principle is reflected in the lab's current work. In both the pancreatic cancer and lung cancer mouse models they tested, the researchers found no signs of toxicity or harm to major organs. \"We're setting a higher bar for specificity when it comes to new cancer targets and treatments,\" Vakoc says.\n\nTheir efforts extend beyond developing future therapies. By revealing how cellular identity is controlled and altered in cancer, the team is contributing to a deeper scientific understanding that could help shape a more precise and effective standard of care in the years ahead.\n\nResearch Funding: National Cancer Institute, Pershing Square Sohn Cancer Research Alliance, CSHL-Northwell Health Affiliation, Treeline Biosciences, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Defense, Howard Hughes Medical Institute",

      "title": "New obesity discovery rewrites decades of fat metabolism science",
      "summary": "Researchers have uncovered a surprising new role for the HSL protein: beyond breaking down fat, it also works inside the nucleus of fat cells to keep them functioning properly. When HSL is missing, fat tissue doesn’t expand as expected— instead, it shrinks, leading to lipodystrophy. This unexpected discovery helps explain why both obesity and fat-loss disorders share similar health risks, and it opens up fresh paths for understanding metabolic diseases at a time when obesity affects billions worldwide.",
      "content": "Our fat cells, known as adipocytes, do far more than store extra body weight. They serve as an important energy reserve for the body. Inside each adipocyte, fat is packed into lipid droplets that can be tapped when fuel is needed -- for example, during the hours between meals. To release this stored energy, the body relies on a protein called HSL, which functions much like a switch. When energy is running low, hormones such as adrenaline activate HSL, prompting it to free fat that can then supply various organs.\n\nWithout HSL, it would be reasonable to expect fat to build up, as though the body had lost access to its energy supply. Surprisingly, this is not what happens. Research involving both mice and patients with mutations in the HSL gene shows that the lack of this protein does not lead to excess fat or obesity. Instead, affected individuals experience a loss of fat mass, a condition known as lipodystrophy.\n\nAlthough obesity and lipodystrophy appear to be complete opposites, both involve fat cells that do not function properly. As a result, each condition can contribute to metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular problems.\n\nHSL Found in an Unexpected Location Inside Fat Cells\n\nTo understand this surprising behavior, a team led by Dominique Langin, professor at the University of Toulouse within the I2MC, took a closer look at where HSL is found inside adipocytes. The protein is well known for its role at the surface of lipid droplets, where it helps break down stored fat. However, the study revealed that HSL also resides inside the nucleus of fat cells. \"In the nucleus of adipocytes, HSL is able to associate with many other proteins and take part in a program that maintains an optimal amount of adipose tissue and keeps adipocytes 'healthy',\" explains Jérémy Dufau, co-author of the study, who completed his doctoral thesis on this topic.\n\nThe researchers also found that nuclear HSL levels are tightly controlled. Adrenaline, which activates the form of HSL located on lipid droplets, also encourages the protein to leave the nucleus. This process occurs naturally during fasting. In contrast, obese mice show elevated levels of HSL within the nucleus, suggesting a shift in this regulatory system.\n\nA Revised Understanding of HSL's Role in Metabolism\n\n\"HSL has been known since the 1960s as a fat-mobilizing enzyme. But we now know that it also plays an essential role in the nucleus of adipocytes, where it helps maintain healthy adipose tissue,\" says Dominique Langin. This additional responsibility helps explain why the absence of HSL results in lipodystrophy, and it offers new insights into metabolic disorders such as obesity and related health complications.\n\nThis discovery appears at a critical time. In France, one in two adults is overweight or obese, and globally the number reaches two and a half billion people. Obesity increases the risk of a range of diseases, including diabetes and heart problems, and often reduces overall quality of life. Continued scientific research is crucial to improving prevention efforts and patient care.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Fat cells, called adipocytes, store energy for the body by keeping fat in little droplets. A protein named hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) helps break down this fat when the body needs energy, like between meals.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers found that HSL does more than just break down fat. It also works inside the nucleus of fat cells to keep them healthy and functioning well. When HSL is missing, instead of fat building up, fat tissue shrinks, causing a condition called lipodystrophy. This was studied in mice and people with HSL gene mutations.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery changes how scientists think about fat and metabolism. It explains why both obesity (too much fat) and lipodystrophy (too little fat) can cause similar health problems, like heart disease. Knowing that HSL works inside the nucleus helps us understand fat cell health better and opens new ways to study and treat metabolic diseases.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will explore how HSL’s role in the nucleus can be used to develop new treatments for obesity and other metabolic problems. This research could lead to better ways to keep fat cells healthy and prevent related diseases.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists found that the fat-breaking protein HSL also helps control fat cell health from inside the cell nucleus, reshaping our understanding of obesity and fat disorders.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les cellules graisseuses, appelées adipocytes, stockent de l'énergie pour le corps en gardant la graisse dans de petites gouttelettes. Une protéine appelée lipase hormonodépendante (HSL) aide à décomposer cette graisse quand le corps a besoin d'énergie, comme entre les repas.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Les chercheurs ont découvert que HSL fait plus que décomposer la graisse. Elle agit aussi à l'intérieur du noyau des cellules graisseuses pour les garder en bonne santé et fonctionnelles. Quand HSL manque, au lieu que la graisse s'accumule, le tissu graisseux diminue, causant une maladie appelée lipodystrophie. Cela a été étudié chez des souris et des personnes avec des mutations du gène HSL.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte change la façon dont les scientifiques pensent à la graisse et au métabolisme. Elle explique pourquoi l'obésité (trop de graisse) et la lipodystrophie (trop peu de graisse) peuvent causer des problèmes de santé similaires, comme les maladies cardiaques. Savoir que HSL travaille dans le noyau aide à mieux comprendre la santé des cellules graisseuses et ouvre de nouvelles voies pour étudier et traiter les maladies métaboliques.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques vont explorer comment le rôle de HSL dans le noyau peut être utilisé pour développer de nouveaux traitements contre l'obésité et d'autres problèmes métaboliques. Cette recherche pourrait conduire à de meilleures façons de garder les cellules graisseuses en bonne santé et prévenir les maladies associées.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – Les scientifiques ont découvert que la protéine qui décompose la graisse, HSL, aide aussi à contrôler la santé des cellules graisseuses depuis l'intérieur du noyau, transformant notre compréhension de l'obésité et des troubles liés à la graisse.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Las células grasas, llamadas adipocitos, almacenan energía para el cuerpo guardando grasa en pequeñas gotas. Una proteína llamada lipasa sensible a hormonas (HSL) ayuda a descomponer esta grasa cuando el cuerpo necesita energía, como entre comidas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Los investigadores encontraron que HSL hace más que descomponer la grasa. También trabaja dentro del núcleo de las células grasas para mantenerlas saludables y funcionando bien. Cuando falta HSL, en lugar de acumular grasa, el tejido graso se encoge, causando una enfermedad llamada lipodistrofia. Esto se estudió en ratones y personas con mutaciones en el gen HSL.\n\n**Impacto** – Este descubrimiento cambia cómo los científicos entienden la grasa y el metabolismo. Explica por qué tanto la obesidad (demasiada grasa) como la lipodistrofia (muy poca grasa) pueden causar problemas de salud similares, como enfermedades del corazón. Saber que HSL trabaja dentro del núcleo ayuda a entender mejor la salud de las células grasas y abre nuevas formas de estudiar y tratar enfermedades metabólicas.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos explorarán cómo el papel de HSL en el núcleo puede usarse para desarrollar nuevos tratamientos para la obesidad y otros problemas metabólicos. Esta investigación podría llevar a mejores maneras de mantener las células grasas saludables y prevenir enfermedades relacionadas.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Los científicos descubrieron que la proteína que descompone la grasa, HSL, también ayuda a controlar la salud de las células grasas desde dentro del núcleo, cambiando nuestra comprensión de la obesidad y los trastornos de la grasa.",
