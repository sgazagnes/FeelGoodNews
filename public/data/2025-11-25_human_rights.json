      "title": "The flashpoint generation: How Gen Z is rewriting the rules of protest the world over",
      "summary": "From Kathmandu to Antananarivo, from Jakarta to Lima, a digital native generation is shaking the foundations of power and teaching the world that democracy’s revival may come not from institutions, but from those who’ve lost faith in them.",
      "content": "When young Nepalis began sharing memes and kickstarting discussions mocking government corruption in April 2025, few in Kathmandu’s political circles took notice. Flash forward to September 2025 and, within days, TikTok reels turned into street marches, Discord threads became strategy meetings. By the time social media bans were imposed, the movement had already outpaced them, spreading through encrypted servers and proxy networks, uniting thousands under a single mantra: we are here and we will be heard.\n\nThis is the new face of protest. From Nepal’s capital to Indonesia’s streets, from Madagascar’s universities to Bangladesh’s squares, Gen Z — a generation of digital natives born roughly between the late 1990s and early 2010s — is rewriting what mobilization looks like. Some words come to mind: fluid, decentralized, irreverent, fast and disruptive, moving their tentacles through networks.\n\nTwo constants continue to define them: mastery of digital tools, and a refusal to settle for the status quo.\n\n“Young people have effectively leveraged tools such as social media by using them in ways that outpace traditional systems, and the pivotal role it played in uniting youth was evident in the recent protests in Nepal. Young people rallied their peers through memes, reels, and posts on various platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, and Discord, in the process of building a shared political language to articulate their grievances. Frustratingly, for established powers who lack the digital literacy their younger counterparts possess, it proved difficult to fully understand the scope of such a movement as it took shape in various corners of the internet, let alone penetrate or exert control over it,” shares Juria Sato Bajracharya of Global Nation in an interview with Bibbi Abruzzini of Forus.\n\nYoung people are demanding transparency, merit-based governance, and decisions made openly, not in smoke-filled rooms.\n\n“Despite its decentralised and leaderless nature, the movement was unified by the strong voice of young people, who shared common, clear priorities: an end to institutional corruption and to the politicization of public institutions. Young people, rooted in a sense of generational solidarity, are refusing to settle for the status quo, instead choosing to forge a future of their own. This has meant reinventing political life: for example, the Nepali Gen Z movement strongly emphasized transparency, with demands for decisions to be made openly and with public knowledge and consensus,” Bajracharya adds.\n\nNepal: The meme that brought down a government\n\nIn Nepal, the spark came from a government attempt to tighten control over free speech as well as civic space and — in an even more destructive move — to restrict social media. Within thirty hours of the first online call to protest, the elected government had fallen in a culmination of thousands of micro-actions.\n\n“The approach to politics has shifted, with a focus on knowledge- and merit-led governance rather than traditional power dynamics,” notes Bajracharya.\n\nOut of the “beautiful chaos” came a new demand for competence. “Over the past month, the political consciousness of young people has undergone a significant transformation.”\n\nYouths push for governance based on knowledge and integrity. Even after the protests subsided, the conversations didn’t. Across TikTok, Facebook groups, and local cafés, young Nepalis continue to debate what they call the Gen-Z Mandate as elections have been announced for March 2026.\n\nAn example is the appointment of grassroots digital activist Mahabir Pun, the new Minister for Education, Science, and Technology, who was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay award in 2007 in recognition of his work on providing internet access to rural areas of Nepal with the Nepal Wireless Networking Project.\n\n“A government built on merit and comprising individuals with dependable credentials is, in the eyes of the youth, a government worth believing in,” Bajracharya shares. “Movements like this have already begun reshaping political culture, influencing policy debates, and shifting public opinion.”\n\nAs documented by the EU System for an Enabling Environment for Civil Society (EU SEE), the transformative crisis in Nepal also highlights further regional deteriorations in the enabling environment for civil society. Despite constitutional protections, CSOs in India continue to face surveillance, harassment and increasing legal scrutiny. Sri Lanka remains in a precarious position since President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in 2022. In neighboring Bhutan, civil society activities are constrained by bureaucratic red tape, a lack of access to information, and the discretionary implementation of restrictive laws. In Pakistan, mass convictions of opposition party supporters have had a chilling effect on civil society. The situation in Myanmar is particularly critical. The military junta has halted the NGO distribution of critical HIV, malaria and tuberculosis medications, while travel bans and transport restrictions are on the rise as regional tensions increase.\n\nAnd while Nepal’s political shift has captured global attention, just across the region, Sri Lanka’s youth have been forging their own path toward democratic renaissance.\n\nIt’s not just Gen Z\n\nKasumi Ranasinghe Arachchige, an integrative researcher, activist and CADE Youth Voices for Digital Rights advocate from Sri Lanka, speaks from within a powerful moment of youth-driven civic awakening in her country.\n\nSri Lankan young people have a long history of student mobilization and community organizing, but the 2022 Aragalaya marked a historic turning point: a decentralized, digitally enabled, intersectional uprising where thousands occupied streets and public squares demanding accountability, democratic reform and an end to economic crisis.\n\nFor Arachchige, what happened was about exclusion and survival. As she explains in an interview with Forus, “it’s not just a Gen Z or it’s not a generation that is asking, it is literally the people who have been neglected, who have been prioritized less, who have not been given basic necessities… access to health, security, water and all the requirements for humans, for civilizations to continue.”\n\nHer grounding in psychology and ecopsychology shapes how she understands the emotional pulse behind today’s movements. Young people, she says, are not imagining climate and economic collapse in abstract terms, they can feel it arriving: “The younger generations are seeing the future, but not as a far-fetched destruction — a very limited and closely coming one.” That proximity, she notes, is why “we see a lot more younger generations, a lot more young people on the streets.”\n\nThe Aragalaya also transformed public perception of protest. Drawing from that moment, Arachchige reflects, “these movements were decentralized and that was their strength.” Digital networks offered protection, connection and amplification, allowing ordinary people to step into political agency. She recalls how legal, creative and community support emerged organically from legal support to emotional backups. And crucially, she notes public stigma around protest shifted.\n\nWhat she sees in Sri Lanka echoes youth movements across Asia and Africa: “We are seeing pockets of protests everywhere.” Across these struggles, she argues, the heart of the fight is not generational branding but systemic change. “It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a certain generation,” she says. “It’s the request of systems change, asking for social justice, climate justice, and economic justice.”\n\nThe most affected by crisis are leading the fight for the future, and they refuse to be dismissed as merely ‘young.’ They are citizens demanding dignity, autonomy, and a livable world.\n\nMadagascar: When inequality and corruption ignite\n\nThousands of kilometers away, another island nation is shaking. On September 25, 2025, students in Antananarivo, Madagascar, took to the streets over blackouts and water cuts. The protests, driven by worsening living conditions and political corruption, spread like wildfire across Madagascar’s provinces: Diego, Toamasina, Toliara, Mahajanga, Fianarantsoa.\n\n“Joined by nearly a thousand citizens, including many young people from the Generation-Z Madagascar movement, very active on social media, the demonstrators had planned to gather at Democracy Square in Ambohijatovo (a historic site in the capital and also the designated place for the protest). The security forces, however, blocked their advance and resorted to what were deemed disproportionate measures. Tear gas, rubber bullets, and even automatic rifle fire (AK-47 type) were reported,” according to alerts from the EU SEE initiative which monitors an enabling environment for civil society in over 86 countries.\n\nAuthorities dismissed them as “student disturbances.” By nightfall, there were nationwide uprisings.\n\n“We were getting back our dignity,” says Morasata Alimana Marc, Vice-president of Madagascar’s civil-society platform PFNOSCM.\n\nOn October 13, after weeks of clashes the president fled the country. Parliament was dissolved. An interim military government promised a new start — though history’s warning hung heavy. The country’s crises had become cyclical: 1972, 1990–92, 2002, 2009, and now 2025 according to Erico Randriarimalala, member of PFNOSCM and of the Human Rights Observatory in Madagascar.\n\n“We have the right to speak out when our society is failing us. In Madagascar, our decision-makers are not respecting our basic rights — we are seeing growing restrictions on freedom of expression, and a lack of access to quality education, decent jobs, and policies that address our most fundamental needs. Today, people are even having to protest simply to secure access to water and electricity,” he explains in an interview with Forus.\n\n“Young people are not trusting a system that does not respond to their aspirations, marked by nepotism and corruption. All these phenomena have compounded the frustrations and anger of young people. They have shown their ‘ras de bol’ [feeling fed up] in response to social injustice,” Erico adds. “The youth movement has earned broad public support as everyone wants to see change. We need to listen, trust and co-create with the youth while being mindful of their autonomy.”\n\nEchoing the challenges faced in Madagascar, where citizens are struggling with unequal access to basic services and rights, in Asia, frustration over systemic neglect and social inequality is fueling grassroots mobilization and public demand for accountability.\n\nThey are often sparked by seemingly small incidents that expose systemic injustice as unpacked in the recent Vuka! Coalition Solidarity Dialogue which focused on resistance against corruption and authoritarianism in Asia and the role of youths.\n\nIn Indonesia, outrage over MPs flaunting luxury cars and voting themselves massive allowances escalated after a driver was killed by police, mobilising students, gig workers, and unions nationwide. Outrage spilled onto the streets under the hashtag #IndonesiaGelap (“Indonesia in darkness”).\n\nIn Bangladesh, protests over job quotas reserved for elites toppled a 15-year authoritarian regime, while in the Philippines, exposure of “ghost” infrastructure projects led to mass demonstrations. It opened a floodgate. Hundreds were arrested, including minors, under dictatorship-era laws. In response, detainees organised from behind bars, forming the Alliance Against Corruption and Police Brutality (ACAB). Upon release, they found unexpected allies.\n\nLearning across borders\n\nThe Gen Z rebellion with intergenerational, intersectional and different manifestations of “youths” is global.\n\nIn Peru, youth mobilisations against pension reforms have collided with a government increasingly hostile to dissent Law 32301 — giving authorities sweeping powers over NGOs — has muzzled activists just as protests turn deadly.\n\n“Civil society’s protective role is shrinking as risks grow,” says Carlos Arana from the Asociación Nacional de Centros (ANC). Still, artists, students, and informal workers keep taking to the streets, demanding their voice to be heard and change to occur.\n\n“Young people, regardless of party affiliation or other generations, have consistently called citizens to take responsibility for protest. Their deep attachment to values of justice and equity allows them to intermittently emerge as catalysts for societal change,” adds Josefina Huamán, Executive Secretary of ANC, which is also the secretariat of la Mesa de Articulación de Asociaciones Nacionales y Redes de ONGs de América Latina y el Caribe (a coordinating body for the national associations and networks of NGOs in Latin America and the Caribbean).\n\nOn October 15, 2025, various Gen-Z groups mobilized along the main avenues of metropolitan Lima and gathered in a sit-in in front of the Palace of Justice to fight against the violent repression of protests which led to several deaths.\n\nAt this point that Gen Z representative Yackov Solano, announced a national — peaceful — strike and mobilisation for November 14, sharing a clear message through a megaphone: “Peru is a beautiful country with great potential; let’s not allow it to be tarnished by people who don’t know how to handle power. As a young person, I regret that [the National Police] are getting their hands dirty with innocents, under a government that is mistreating them. I know they have commanders who don’t know what they’re doing […] We are not their enemies, we are not seeking power, we are simply seeking a cleansing of our country.”\n\nThese dynamics resonate across the region, where young people and broader civil society are responding to systemic inequality and government repression.\n\nIn Paraguay, a youth-led march organized by members of “Gen Z” in September against impunity, corruption, and the misuse of public resources was met with violence. Despite being peaceful, the event unfolded under a massive police operation involving around 3,000 officers, which the National Police claimed was meant to “accompany the youth.”\n\nAccording to EU SEE data, the march, promoted on social media, gathered around 300 to 400 participants, including both young people and adults. Early on, attendees reported excessive police controls and the arrest of four individuals. Organisers had previously stated that the demonstration was peaceful, unaffiliated with any political parties or NGOs, and unfunded. They also warned of misleading messages online attempting to misrepresent the nature of the protest, with officers infiltrating WhatsApp, Telegram, and other social media groups.\n\n“What was unusual about this event was the excessive police presence, the heavy-handed repression of protesters at the end of the day, and the large number of detainees held without cause. Another novel aspect was the ‘cyber-policing’ on social media conducted by the authorities prior to the demonstration. Previous citizen mobilisations, such as those in March 2025, had not faced such extreme measures from the police,” civil society representatives from Pojoaju (Asociación de ONG's del Paraguay, the Association of NGOs from Paraguay), shared with Forus and the EU SEE network.\n\nVarious movements continue to hit the streets, notably to protest “anti-NGO” laws. On October 23,2025, President Santiago Peña passed Decree 4806 regulating and thereby putting into effect Law 7363 on control, transparency and accountability of Non-Profit Organizations.\n\nThis law, dubbed “Anti-NGO Law” or “Ley Garrote” (Stranglehold Law) by civil society, had been enacted in November 2024 and was awaiting subsequent regulation for more than eleven months. The law subjects CSOs to arbitrary state oversight without proper avenues for defense, undermining their autonomy and role in promoting human rights, democracy, and social welfare. CSOs warn about the discretionary control embedded in the law that enables its targeted use against civil society actors critical of the state. The law is seen by civil society as a tool for state surveillance, rather than a transparency mechanism, and could be used to silence opposition voices, especially those critical of the government.\n\nAs repression is swift, so are the responses: cross-regional peer forums, civic-rights education campaigns, diplomatic pushes and creation of new spaces to expose hypocrisy between rhetoric and repression.\n\nAnd now we are seeing how Gen Z’s anger isn’t only about repression; it’s about the climate, about corruption, inequality, and everyday injustice that are the fault lines of the new global discontent.\n\nDespite borders and languages, the movements are starting to learn from one another. Filipino activists share their “people’s lawyer” model with peers. Digital collectives swap security tips and data-verification tools. What looks chaotic from afar is, up close, a growing network of shared strategy. Bridges are being built in real time. The “machinery of repression” is, paradoxically, creating a machinery of solidarity.\n\nThis article was written by Bibbi Abruzzini and Clarisse Sih, of Forus, with support from Forus members, the EU SEE network as well as the CADE Youth Voices for Digital Rights cohort.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nYoung people born between the late 1990s and early 2010s, known as Generation Z, are using digital tools to challenge governments and demand fairer societies. Across countries like Nepal, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Peru, youth movements are growing fast, using social media and online networks to organize protests.\n\n**What happened**\nIn 2025, young people in Nepal started sharing memes and videos online to criticize government corruption. These digital actions quickly turned into large street protests, even after social media was restricted. Similar movements appeared in Madagascar, where students protested against blackouts and water shortages, leading to the president fleeing the country. In Sri Lanka and Indonesia, youth-led protests called for democratic reforms and justice. In Peru and Paraguay, young people protested against repression and unfair laws targeting civil society groups.\n\n**Impact**\nThese protests show a new way of demanding change that is fast, spread out, and powered by technology. Young people are pushing for governments based on knowledge, transparency, and fairness instead of old power systems. They have already influenced political decisions, such as appointing leaders with strong backgrounds in Nepal. Their actions also highlight problems like corruption, inequality, and climate concerns that affect their future. Despite facing repression, these youth movements are connecting across countries to share ideas and support each other.\n\n**What's next step**\nElections are planned in places like Nepal, where youth hope to see real change. Youth groups are organizing peaceful strikes and continuing discussions online and offline. Civil society organizations are working to protect these movements from government crackdowns, and activists are sharing tools to stay safe and effective. The global network of young protesters is expected to grow stronger and keep pushing for social and political reforms.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nGeneration Z is using digital tools and street protests worldwide to demand honest governments and a fairer future.\n",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 24 November 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03860-5Information about the roles of each author of a paper can help to build trust, integrity and responsible research assessment. Coordinated efforts are needed to consolidate progress.",
      "content": "A decade ago, we and others launched a tool for clarifying the roles of each author of a research paper. The Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) includes 14 types of contribution, from conceptualization to software and data curation. It was designed to prevent questionable authorship practices and make it easier for researchers to demonstrate the diversity of their contributions to science, among other benefits.\n\nCredit where credit is due\n\nThis year, taking stock, we’ve shown that adoption has risen steadily (see ‘More CRediT is being given’)1. By 2024, CRediT information was included in nearly 850,000 publications (encompassing articles, preprints and conference papers) — around 22% of the 3.7 million publications recorded last year in Digital Science’s Dimensions, a database of scholarly publications.\n\nThis level of uptake is remarkable, given that there have been no coordinated efforts or mandates from publishers and funders. But the issues that the taxonomy was conceived to tackle remain rampant in the research literature. Here we call for CRediT to become the norm, to support researchers and research integrity across the whole academic landscape.\n\nCRediT is still needed\n\nDespite widening use of CRediT, authorship conventions in scholarly publishing remain opaque and confusing, and differ by discipline. They typically provide little to no information about who contributed what in a study (see ‘The parts we played’). A name’s position in a list of authors is an unreliable indicator of the significance of that person’s work or the time they spent, particularly when the author list is long or alphabetical, as is common in economics2 and for large collaborations, and as also occurs in biomedical research3.\n\nStop treating code like an afterthought: record, share and value it\n\nQuestionable practices, such as including honorary authors, who are named but have not contributed, and excluding ‘ghost authors’, who have contributed but are not named, also remain prevalent — perhaps occurring in as much as one-fifth of biomedical papers4.\n\nMeanwhile, the volume of misconduct allegations and retractions in research is skyrocketing. When results are questioned after publication, transparency as to who did what helps investigators, supports accountability and can help to foster a responsible authorship culture more generally5.\n\nCRediT data can also be used to inform policy interventions that help to drive innovation, equity and impact in science. Data on author contributions have been used to study gender and the division of labour in research6,7, as well as variations in the distribution of roles across disciplines8, for example.\n\nSource: Analysis by L. Allen et al.\n\nThe tool can help institutions and funders to identify skills being used in cutting-edge fields. Institutions could use the taxonomy to analyse the contributions of their researchers and identify talent that should be retained and developed. Funders can identify specialists — such as data scientists or research software engineers — for targeted funding opportunities or to serve as expert peer reviewers.\n\nInitiatives such as the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), launched in 2012, and the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) now champion the need to consider diverse contributions to research when assessing individuals’ performance9. And the value of CRediT is increasingly acknowledged by science organizations such as the UK Academy of Medical Sciences. In 2022, the taxonomy became a recognized standard of the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) — meaning that publishers and other stakeholders internationally are encouraged to adopt it.\n\nRoadblocks to progress\n\nDespite the need for CRediT, further progress is held back by the changing research landscape, a lack of resources and inconsistent implementation.\n\nThe use of CRediT has spread across disciplines and geographies1 — indicating that it strikes a chord. But some roles might fall outside the original 14 or be better represented by improving definitions of the existing roles, especially in fields such as social sciences and engineering, which were under-represented in the corpus of publications used to develop the taxonomy. For example, community engagement is becoming an increasingly important role as researchers strive to improve relationships with study participants, and because of citizen science. The CRediT term ‘software’ might need to be expanded to better reflect infrastructure development and data science. And the spread of new technologies, such as AI, could also alter the roles of scientists across the research landscape, from hypothesis generation to the writing-up of results.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – For many years, it has been hard to know exactly what each author did on a research paper. Author lists often don’t show who contributed what, leading to confusion and unfair credit. To fix this, a system called CRediT (Contributor Role Taxonomy) was created ten years ago. It breaks down 14 different types of research work, like designing the study, writing, or managing data.\n\n**What happened** – Over the past decade, CRediT has been used more and more. By 2024, nearly 850,000 research papers included detailed author roles using CRediT. This is about 22% of all papers in a big research database. Even though no official rules require it, many researchers and journals have adopted the system to show who did what.\n\n**Impact** – Using CRediT helps make research clearer and fairer. It stops problems like naming people who didn’t contribute (“honorary authors”) or leaving out those who did (“ghost authors”). It also helps when questions arise about research, because it shows who was responsible for each part. Beyond fairness, it helps universities and funders find experts in specific skills, like software or data work, so they can support them better.\n\n**What’s next step** – While CRediT has grown, there are still challenges. Some research areas might need new or clearer contribution categories. For example, roles related to community work or new technology like artificial intelligence might need to be added. Also, wider adoption by publishers, funders, and institutions is needed to make CRediT the normal way to credit authors.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – After ten years, CRediT is improving how research contributions are recognized, helping make science more transparent and fair, with more progress ahead.\n",
      "personality_title_fr": "Dix ans pour mieux reconnaître les auteurs de recherche améliorent la confiance et l’équité",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Pendant longtemps, il était difficile de savoir exactement ce que chaque auteur avait fait dans un article scientifique. La liste des auteurs ne montrait souvent pas qui avait contribué à quoi, ce qui causait de la confusion et de l’injustice. Pour remédier à cela, un système appelé CRediT (Taxonomie des Rôles des Contributeurs) a été créé il y a dix ans. Il décrit 14 types différents de travail scientifique, comme concevoir l’étude, écrire ou gérer les données.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Au cours des dix dernières années, CRediT a été de plus en plus utilisé. En 2024, près de 850 000 articles scientifiques indiquaient précisément le rôle de chaque auteur grâce à CRediT. Cela représente environ 22 % de tous les articles dans une grande base de données scientifique. Même sans obligation officielle, de nombreux chercheurs et revues ont adopté ce système pour clarifier les contributions.\n\n**Impact** – L’utilisation de CRediT rend la recherche plus claire et plus juste. Elle empêche des problèmes comme nommer des personnes qui n’ont pas contribué (« auteurs honoraires ») ou oublier celles qui ont aidé (« auteurs fantômes »). Cela aide aussi quand des questions se posent sur une étude, car on sait qui a fait quoi.

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Durante mucho tiempo, fue difícil saber exactamente qué hizo cada autor en un artículo científico. Las listas de autores a menudo no mostraban quién contribuyó en qué, lo que causaba confusión e injusticia. Para solucionar esto, hace diez años se creó un sistema llamado CRediT (Taxonomía de Roles de Contribución). Este sistema divide el trabajo en 14 tipos diferentes, como diseñar el estudio, escribir o manejar datos.\n\n**Qué pasó** – En los últimos diez años, el uso de CRediT ha crecido mucho. Para 2024, casi 850,000 artículos científicos incluían los roles detallados de los autores usando CRediT. Esto representa alrededor del 22% de todos los artículos en una gran base de datos de investigación. Aunque no hay reglas oficiales que lo exijan, muchos investigadores y revistas han adoptado este sistema para mostrar quién hizo qué.\n\n**Impacto** – Usar CRediT ayuda a que la investigación sea más clara y justa. Evita problemas como nombrar personas que no contribuyeron (“autores honorarios”) o dejar fuera a quienes sí lo hicieron (“autores fantasma”). También ayuda cuando hay dudas sobre una investigación, porque muestra quién fue responsable de cada parte. Más allá de la justicia, ayuda a universidades y financiadores a encontrar expertos en habilidades específicas, como software o manejo de datos, para apoyarlos mejor.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Aunque CRediT ha crecido, todavía hay desafíos. Algunas áreas de investigación pueden necesitar categorías nuevas o definiciones más claras. Por ejemplo, los roles relacionados con trabajo comunitario o nuevas tecnologías como la inteligencia artificial podrían agregarse. También se necesita que más editores, financiadores e instituciones adopten CRediT para que sea la forma normal de reconocer a los autores.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Después de diez años, CRediT mejora cómo se reconocen las contribuciones en la investigación, haciendo la ciencia más transparente y justa, con más avances por venir.\n",

The Times reports that she is urging Labour MPs to \"unite for her Budget\", hitting out at what she calls \"misogynist critics\". Pre-Budget leaks had been \"incredibly destabilising\", she adds, with the paper quoting her address to MPs at the Commons.\n\n\"The Chancellor will significantly cut the annual £20,000 cash Isa (Individual Savings Account) allowance to £12,000,\" the Daily Mail reports. Lowering the tax-free interest limit could \"punish savers while potentially causing mortgage rates to rise\", according to the paper. It reports the chancellor could use her fiscal statement to argue the \"billions of pounds sitting in the savings accounts would generate better returns if it was invested in the riskier stock market\".\n\nA proposal to introduce a council tax surcharge on properties worth more than £2m could turn into a \"'sticking plaster' for the government\", the i newspaper writes. It describes the measure as a \"mansion tax\", quoting warnings from the former Institute for Fiscal Studies economist Paul Johnson, who tells the paper the system \"needs a complete overhaul\".\n\nThe Silver Voices campaign group cautions the chancellor that \"many older people will struggle to heat their homes without help with the cost of living\", the Daily Express reports. \"Frozen income tax thresholds expected in tomorrow's Budget will lead to frozen homes\", the paper writes, adding that people already struggling with soaring energy costs \"are hammered with higher tax bills\".\n\nThe Independent leads with \"reports that efforts to grow the economy have stalled\", citing unpublished analysis from the economic watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The paper says the OBR has \"reportedly downgraded its forecast for growth in each year until 2029\", adding that the news \"could not come at a worse time for the beleaguered chancellor\".\n\nUS and Ukrainian negotiators drafted an incomplete peace proposal in Geneva, which \"leaves big calls to presidents\", the Financial Times says. \"Washington had been pressing Kyiv to agree a 28-point proposal developed by US and Russian officials\", the paper writes. Parts of the plan, such as territorial concessions, crossed \"Ukrainian red lines\". The paper says the outstanding \"politically sensitive elements\" of the Geneva plan will be decided by Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"1,000 abuse victims safer,\" writes the Metro, reporting on the number of domestic abuse protection orders (DAPOs) imposed in the year since they were introduced. The paper says the DAPOs \"limit perpetrators' movements, with breaches punishable by up to five years\".\n\nHundreds of thousands of vulnerable unpaid carers will have their cases reassessed after a damning official review, the Guardian writes. Some carers were \"plunged into hardship; others were jailed\" after \"draconian penalties of as much as £20,000\" were foisted on some carers. A review blames \"government failure and maladministration\", according to the paper.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reports that BBC chair Samir Shah \"has insisted he will not resign despite deep divisions at the broadcaster\". It writes board members are split over how to respond to the Telegraph's \"disclosure of bias at the corporation\", based on a leaked memo.\n\n\"Reform's Russia crisis\" is the Daily Mirror front page headline, as the paper says party leader Nigel Farage is facing \"mounting pressure to investigate pro-Putin links\" in the party. This follows the jailing of former Welsh Reform UK leader Nathan Gill for taking pro-Russian bribes.\n\nThe Daily Star leads with darts champion Luke Littler supporting the paper's campaign to give a knighthood to motor neurone disease charity campaigner and ex-rugby league star Kevin Sinfield.\n\nTV star Jeff Brazier has separated from his wife Kate Dwyer, the Sun reports. It says the split comes 16 years after the death of Brazier's ex-partner Jade Goody, who appeared on Big Brother years earlier.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Domestic abuse is a serious problem that affects many people. To help protect victims, the UK introduced new rules called Domestic Abuse Protection Orders (DAPOs) about a year ago. These orders limit where abusers can go and what they can do to keep victims safer.\n\n**What happened** – Since DAPOs were introduced, around 1,000 orders have been put in place. These legal orders restrict the movements of people accused of domestic abuse. If someone breaks the rules, they can face up to five years in prison. This shows that the government is taking stronger steps to protect victims and hold abusers accountable.\n\n**Impact** – The introduction of DAPOs is important because it provides real protection for victims. Before, victims often had little legal control over their abusers’ actions. Now, with clear restrictions and serious punishments for breaking them, victims can feel safer in their homes and communities. This change helps prevent further abuse and supports victims in rebuilding their lives.\n\n**What's next step** – Authorities will continue to monitor how well DAPOs work and may adjust the rules to make them even stronger. The success so far could encourage more use of these orders and inspire similar protections in other areas or countries.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Domestic Abuse Protection Orders have made 1,000 victims safer by legally limiting abusers’ actions and enforcing strict penalties for violations.",
