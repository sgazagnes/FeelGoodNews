      "content": "The President of Moldova also visited the Sejm and the Senate. In a post on the X platform, she summed up that she had held “fruitful discussions with the speakers of both legislative chambers of Poland.”\n\nPoland continuously supports Moldova on its path to membership in the European Union, said President Karol Nawrocki after a meeting with the President of Moldova. Maia Sandu, thanking Poland for being Chișinău’s advocate in Europe, emphasized that her country wants, among other things, to attract more Polish investments.\n\nDuring her official visit to Warsaw on Monday, the President of Moldova, after meeting with President Nawrocki, also spoke with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Speaker of the Sejm Włodzimierz Czarzasty and Speaker of the Senate Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.\n\nDuring statements to the media after the meeting, President Nawrocki said that Poland is pleased with the direction chosen by Moldova in leaving the Russian sphere of influence. He also assured that Poland – both the president and the government – supports Moldova on its path to the European Union and in its reforms. He assured that “this will not change.”\n\nPresident Nawrocki reported that he and President Sandu discussed security issues, as well as education and memory policy. He stressed that in these areas Poland offers Moldova the support of its experts.\n\n“President Sandu received an assurance of such support today. We will cooperate. Thanks to the Institute of National Remembrance, Poland is becoming something of a model for how to conduct a sovereign historical narrative, how to tell the truth about Soviet crimes and about Soviet mechanisms which in the 21st century are also part of the Russian Federation,” said Nawrocki. He also reported that he had decided to send to Moldova an economic mission and a mission concerning national memory and history.\n\n“We touched on the past, but we are thinking about our future around the ideas that unite both nations – sovereignty, independence and the direction of Western civilization,” said Nawrocki.\n\nReferring to the recent parliamentary elections, in which the pro-European PAS party supported by Sandu won, defeating, among others, pro-Russian forces, Nawrocki said that in Moldova “democracy has been successfully defended,” and that “the long and brave struggle to break away from the Russian sphere of influence has our full support.” The talks also concerned bilateral economic relations, including Polish investments in Moldova, among others in the wine sector.\n\nIn addition, relations with the United States were also discussed. “In fact, this transatlantic alliance between European countries, between Poland and the United States, is a guarantee of peace and security throughout Europe,” declared President Nawrocki.\n\nThe President of Moldova stressed that when Russia attacked Ukraine, her country was entirely dependent on Russian gas. She admitted that now – thanks to support from, among others, Poland – Moldova has been able to give up trade with the country of Władimir Putin. As she pointed out, Moldovan institutions, media and citizens also stood up to Moscow, which tried to interfere in the course of the 2025 parliamentary elections. Sandu reported that, according to Moldovan assessments, Russia spent the equivalent of about 2 percent of Moldova’s GDP on attempts to interfere in the parliamentary elections in Moldova last year.\n\nSandu also pointed out that “the European Union report recognized that last year Moldova made the greatest progress among all candidate countries.” “For us, accession to the European Union is the clearest guarantee of security, democracy and freedom, while Poland is a constant, trustworthy advocate of Moldova in the European Union,” she said, emphasizing that her country is accelerating the reforms necessary for accession to the European Union and strengthening its institutions.\n\n“Moldova is fully committed to this process. We believe in the European project and we want to contribute to it,” declared Sandu. She also pointed out that the key issue now is building the state’s resilience and counteracting hybrid attacks from Russia; she also thanked Poland for the support it provides her country in this area.\n\nThe President of Moldova also drew attention to issues of history and memory policy. She declared that Moldova “wants to learn from Poland’s experience” in this area. As she said, in Moldova the work of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance is known and appreciated, as is the past of Nawrocki as the head of this institution.\n\nShe assured that Moldova treats Poland’s support not only as a sign of friendship, but also as a foundation on which cooperation between the two countries can be expanded. “Moldova wants to increase trade with Poland and attract more Polish investments in agriculture, industrial sectors, IT, construction and the digital economy,” she added. “Moldova is proud to be able to stand alongside Poland,” she declared.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Maia Sandu met with Prime Minister Tusk. “We discussed Moldova’s accession to the European Union, regional security, stronger trade ties and ways to create greater economic opportunities for our countries. Poland’s experience and support are of great importance for Moldova’s future in Europe,” Sandu later wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe President of Moldova also visited the Sejm and the Senate. In a post on X, she summed up that she had held “fruitful discussions with the speakers of both legislative chambers of Poland.” “Parliamentary cooperation is essential for reforms, accession to the European Union and strengthening democratic institutions. Moldova values Poland’s support and experience,” wrote Sandu.\n\nThe Chancellery of the Senate reported that the main topic of Speaker Kidawa-Błońska’s meeting with the President of Moldova “was security in the region, including the war in Ukraine and Russia’s hybrid and disinformation activities in Europe.” The Speaker of the Senate expressed full support for Moldova’s European aspirations. The Speaker of the Sejm, Włodzimierz Czarzasty, also assured President Sandu that Poland would support Moldova on its path to the European Union. As the Chancellery of the Sejm reported, their conversation also concerned the war in Ukraine and threats from Russia.\n\nRepresentatives of the Moldovan government were also present in Warsaw. Among those who came to Poland was Minister of National Defense Anatolie Nosatîi, who met with Deputy Prime Minister and head of the Ministry of National Defense Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz. The head of the Polish defense ministry later wrote on X that the topics of the talks were “hybrid threats from Russia, regional security and issues related to the war in Ukraine, as well as bilateral military cooperation.”\n\nMinister of Culture Crisitan Jardan also met with his counterpart. Representatives of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage wrote on X that “during the conversation, they summarized the cultural events which, during the Polish presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2025, were organized in Moldova.”\n\nMaia Sandu has held the office of President of Moldova since 2020 and is regarded as the leader of the pro-European forces in the country. In 2024 she was elected for another term, and last year her Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) won the parliamentary elections, defeating the pro-Russian opposition.\n\nFor years, Poland has expressed support for Moldova’s pro-European aspirations. In August last year, before the parliamentary elections in that country, Prime Minister Tusk, together with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, visited Chișinău to express support for Moldova in its efforts to join the European Union.

      "content": "SOFIA – Bulgaria insists that safeguard clauses be an integral part of all free trade agreements in the agricultural sector. At a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council of the European Union in Brussels, Deputy Minister Dr. Lozana Vasileva stated Bulgaria’s position on the document presented by Poland regarding the necessary actions to protect sensitive agricultural sectors in the context of trade agreements with third countries.\n\nThe Bulgarian Deputy Minister, quoted in a statement from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, said that the safeguard clauses must be an integral part of all free trade agreements in the agricultural sector in order to guarantee the temporary suspension of preferences in the event of a threat to EU production caused by excessive imports.\n\n“Our country has repeatedly emphasized the need to apply uniform requirements to goods from the EU and imported goods,” said Vasileva. She also stressed the need for the creation of a special fund to compensate for possible losses suffered by the agricultural sector as a result of the entry into force of free trade agreements.\n\nDeputy Minister Vasileva also expressed Bulgaria’s position in support of Austria’s document regarding the strong economic pressure to which farmers in the EU are subjected and which threatens their economic viability. The document calls for a number of actions, including the temporary suspension of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) for fertilizers, increased transparency and monitoring of the fertilizer market, the temporary suspension of most-favoured-nation tariffs and specific anti-dumping duties on fertilizers in the interest of the Union.\n\nAt the meeting, the ministers discussed the role of fisheries, agriculture and forestry in the context of the EU Bioeconomy Strategy. Deputy Minister Vasileva noted that Bulgaria has a positive assessment of the Strategy, which contains important elements in support of primary producers. “However, it is necessary to improve access to financing, to facilitate the regulatory framework and to ensure that producers receive a fair share of the created added value,” said Vasileva and added that to provide real and rapid support, it is necessary to take into account national specificities, the specific needs of individual farmers and sustainable business models. According to Vasileva, an appropriate mechanism should be found to ensure that the incentives provided do not lead to additional administrative burdens for the Member States.\n\nDuring the meeting, the ministers also discussed the regulation presented by the European Commission amending the Organic Production Regulation. Vasileva said that Bulgaria supports the proposed changes, which aim to reduce the administrative burden, increase competitiveness, and update the rules to ensure protection and predictability for the organic sector. “The clear timetable for the adoption of the regulation by the end of 2026 will provide predictability for farmers, processors and certification bodies, which will also facilitate their investment decisions,” added the Deputy Minister.

      "content": "Vets may have to publish prices of common pet treatments\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Jemma Crew , Business reporter and Colletta Smith , Your Voice Correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nVeterinary practices will be required to publish prices of common treatments so pet owners can shop around and choose the best value option, according to government proposals. They will also need to have an official operating licence to help drive up standards, under plans from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) -in the first reforms in 60 years. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) watchdog has found that vet prices have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation. The British Veterinary Association, which represents 19,000 members, said it broadly supported the proposals, but these were \"very unlikely to dramatically alter the cost of veterinary care\".\n\nMore than half of all UK households are thought to own a pet. Common treatments might include annual vaccinations, first vaccinations for puppies or kittens, microchipping and neutering or spaying a dog or cat. A File on 4 investigation in April last year found vets bills had skyrocketed. Hundreds of pet owners got in touch with the BBC with concerns. Vets and animal charities have said pet owners were increasingly having their sick animals put down or are delaying taking them for treatment to avoid spiralling vet bills. Mounting concerns over whether pet owners are receiving a fair deal prompted the CMA to launch a formal investigation near the end of last year. It has estimated problems in the veterinary market could be costing households up to £1bn over five years. There are no standardised prices for treatments, and the CMA found 84% of vet practice websites had no pricing information at all. While that investigation is continuing, with final proposals not due until March, the government has now announced its plans to update the way the system is regulated.\n\nUnder government proposals, vet practices would also need to be transparent around pet owners' options and any changes, which the government said would allow them \"to choose the best treatment for their animals\". Knowing key prices beforehand would help them \"to choose the best value\", it said. It said 60% of vet practices are owned by non-vets. Practices would be required to disclose who owns them. This knowledge plus price transparency would help owners decide which practice to use which \"increases competition and brings down cost\". Among its other proposals are: Every vet practice to have an official operating licence – similar to GP surgeries and care homes - helping customers have \"greater confidence in care\"\n\nAn \"easier and more effective\" complaints route\n\nLegal recognition for veterinary nurses to \"strengthen professional identity, helping improve job satisfaction and boosting retention rates\" It is launching an eight-week public consultation, closing on 25 March.\n\n\"It's shocking\"\n\nHelene Svinos, from Manchester, got in touch with BBC Your Voice earlier this month about her experience when her dog Rowan had an emergency admission while away in Suffolk last summer. She was unhappy about the treatment, which cost £1,600, and although she has repeatedly complained, she said her experience has not been investigated. The cost of the treatment pushed her over her insurance limit and meant she could not cover the English springer spaniel's cancer treatment via her policy when he was diagnosed in October 2025, she said. She said she ended up taking out a £10,000 loan \"because I didn't want him to go without anything\". Rowan died last month.\n\nHelene Svinos with her dogs\n\nShe told the BBC: \"As a doctor it's shocking because we have a very good complaints procedure. \"Our pets are family, my life revolves around my pets, and to have awful treatment, and also not be able to complain and then the vet bill on top of that, it's just appalling - it feels like a real kick in the teeth actually.\" There is \"no protection of your consumer rights at all when you take your dog to a vet\", she added.\n\nDr Rob Williams, president of the British Veterinary Association, said it was too simplistic to think that legislative reform would \"somehow massively reduce the cost of veterinary care\". \"There's far too many factors at play,\" he said. \"The cost of living is something that affects vet practices. It is very expensive to deliver the care.\" Williams said: \"As a profession we can do an awful lot more today than we could do even 10 years ago. We have a much better understanding of diagnostics and treatment options… and quite rightly in my view the animal-owning public have a much higher expectation of my profession and what we can deliver in terms of the care we provide for their animals. So all of those things together account for why the cost is the cost.\" He added the reforms would increase transparency and \"may go a long way\" to increasing competition, but \"of themselves they are very unlikely to dramatically alter the cost of veterinary care\".\n\nGetty Images\n\nDr Christine Middlemiss, UK Chief Veterinary Officer, told the BBC that while currently it is just individual veterinary surgeons who are regulated, the proposals would bring whole businesses into scope. It would broaden the availability of services, she said, as veterinary nurses would come under regulation, meaning they would be able to undertake certain standard procedures, whereas currently \"they have to do everything under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon\".",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In the UK, many pet owners have faced rising veterinary bills, with prices increasing nearly twice as fast as other costs. This has made it harder for some people to afford care for their pets. There were no clear rules about how much vets should charge or how prices should be shared with pet owners.\n\n**What happened** – The UK government proposed new rules that will ask veterinary practices to show prices for common pet treatments, like vaccinations and neutering. They also want vets to have official licences, similar to doctors’ offices, to make sure they meet certain standards. These changes come after a government watchdog found that most vets did not share prices online, making it difficult for pet owners to compare costs.\n\n**Impact** – These proposals aim to help pet owners choose the best and most affordable care for their animals by making prices clear and improving trust through licensing. While experts say these rules may not lower costs dramatically, they will create more fairness and competition in the market. This could stop unexpected high bills and give pet owners more confidence when picking a vet.\n\n**What's next step** – The government has started a public consultation, asking people and vets to share their views until March 25. After this, final decisions will be made. If approved, vets will begin publishing prices and getting licences, and veterinary nurses will gain more recognition and responsibility to help with care.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New UK rules will make vet prices clearer and require licences to improve fairness and choice for pet owners.\n\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Au Royaume-Uni, les factures vétérinaires ont beaucoup augmenté, presque deux fois plus vite que d’autres coûts. Cela rendait difficile l’accès aux soins pour certains propriétaires d’animaux. Il n’y avait pas de règles claires sur les tarifs ou leur communication.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Le gouvernement a proposé de nouvelles règles demandant aux cabinets vétérinaires d’afficher les prix des soins courants, comme les vaccins ou la stérilisation. Ils veulent aussi que les vétérinaires aient une licence officielle, comme les cabinets médicaux, pour garantir des normes de qualité. Ces mesures suivent un rapport montrant que la plupart des vétérinaires ne publiaient pas leurs tarifs en ligne.\n\n**Impact** – Ces propositions aideront les propriétaires à choisir des soins adaptés et abordables grâce à plus de transparence et de confiance. Même si cela ne fera pas baisser les prix de façon importante, cela favorisera une meilleure concurrence et évitera les factures surprises.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le gouvernement lance une consultation publique jusqu’au 25 mars pour recueillir les avis. Ensuite, les règles pourraient être mises en place, avec l’obligation d’afficher les prix, d’obtenir une licence et de reconnaître davantage les infirmiers vétérinaires.\n\n**Message clé en une phrase** – De nouvelles règles au Royaume-Uni rendront les prix vétérinaires plus clairs et imposeront des licences pour plus d’équité et de choix.\n\n",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – En el Reino Unido, las facturas veterinarias han subido casi al doble del ritmo de inflación, dificultando que algunos dueños puedan pagar el cuidado de sus mascotas. No había reglas claras sobre los precios ni cómo se debían mostrar.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El gobierno propuso nuevas normas que obligarán a las clínicas veterinarias a mostrar los precios de tratamientos comunes, como vacunas y esterilización. También quieren que los veterinarios tengan licencias oficiales, parecidas a las de los consultorios médicos, para asegurar calidad. Esto sigue a un informe que mostró que la mayoría de los veterinarios no publicaban precios en sus sitios web.\n\n**Impacto** – Estas propuestas ayudarán a los dueños a elegir el mejor cuidado al hacer los precios claros y aumentar la confianza con licencias oficiales. Aunque no se espera que bajen mucho los costos, aumentará la competencia y evitará sorpresas en las facturas.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El gobierno abrió una consulta pública hasta el 25 de marzo para recibir opiniones. Después, se decidirá si se aplican las nuevas reglas, que incluirán mostrar precios, obtener licencias y reconocer más a los enfermeros veterinarios.\n\n**Mensaje clave en una frase** – Nuevas reglas en el Reino Unido harán los precios veterinarios más claros y exigirán licencias para mejorar la equidad y la elección.\n\n",
