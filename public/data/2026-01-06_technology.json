      "summary": "Scientists have found a way to see ultrafast molecular interactions inside liquids using an extreme laser technique once thought impossible for fluids. When they mixed nearly identical chemicals, one combination behaved strangely—producing less light and erasing a single harmonic signal altogether. Simulations revealed that a subtle molecular “handshake” was interfering with electron motion. The discovery shows that liquids can briefly organize in ways that dramatically change how electrons behave.",
      "content": "Liquids and solutions may seem simple, but at the molecular level they are constantly in motion. When sugar dissolves in water, for example, each sugar molecule is quickly surrounded by shifting clusters of water molecules. Inside living cells, the situation becomes even more intricate. Tiny liquid droplets ferry proteins or RNA and help organize many of the cell's chemical reactions.\n\nDespite their central role in biology and chemistry, liquids have long resisted close inspection. Unlike solids, they have no fixed structure, and the most important interactions between dissolved molecules and their surroundings happen at extreme speeds. These ultrafast events, where chemistry truly unfolds, have largely remained out of reach for scientists.\n\nA New Way to See Ultrafast Chemistry in Liquids\n\nResearchers from Ohio State University and Louisiana State University have now demonstrated that high-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) can expose hidden molecular structures inside liquids. This nonlinear optical technique is capable of tracking electron motion on attosecond timescales. The work, published in PNAS, shows that HHS can directly probe solute-solvent interactions in liquid solutions, something that had not been possible before.\n\nHHS uses extremely short laser pulses to momentarily pull electrons away from molecules. When those electrons snap back, they emit light that carries detailed information about how electrons and even atomic nuclei move. These snapshots occur on timescales far faster than conventional methods can resolve. Traditional optical spectroscopy has been widely used to study liquids because it is gentle and easy to interpret, but it operates much more slowly. HHS, on the other hand, reaches into the extreme-ultraviolet range and can resolve events lasting just an attosecond, a billionth of a billionth of a second.\n\nOvercoming the Challenges of Studying Liquids\n\nUntil now, HHS experiments were mostly limited to gases and solids, where conditions are easier to control. Liquids present two major obstacles. They absorb much of the harmonic light that is produced, and their constantly moving molecules make the resulting signals difficult to analyze.\n\nTo address these issues, the OSU-LSU team developed an ultrathin liquid \"sheet\" that allows more of the emitted light to escape. Using this approach, they showed for the first time that HHS can capture rapid molecular dynamics and subtle structural changes in liquids.\n\nA Surprising Result from Simple Liquid Mixtures\n\nWith this new setup, the researchers tested how HHS behaves in straightforward liquid mixtures. They shined intense mid-infrared laser light on methanol combined with small amounts of halobenzenes. These molecules are nearly identical, differing only by a single atom: fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Halobenzenes produce strong harmonic signals that stand out clearly, while methanol provides a relatively clean background. The expectation was that even when present in low concentrations, the halobenzene signal would dominate.\n\nIn most cases, that is exactly what happened. The harmonic emission looked like a simple blend of the two liquids. Fluorobenzene (PhF), however, stood out immediately. \"We were really surprised to see that the PhF-methanol solution gave completely different results from the other solutions,\" said Lou DiMauro, Edward E. and Sylvia Hagenlocker Professor of Physics at OSU. \"Not only was the mixture-yield much lower than for each liquid on its own, we also found that one harmonic was completely suppressed.\" He added that \"such a deep suppression was a clear sign of destructive interference, and it had to be caused by something near the emitters.\"\n\nIn practical terms, the PhF-methanol mixture produced less light than either liquid by itself, and one specific harmonic disappeared entirely. It was as if a single note in the light spectrum had been silenced. This kind of selective loss is extremely rare and pointed to a very specific molecular interaction interfering with the electrons' motion.\n\nSimulations Reveal a Molecular Handshake\n\nTo understand what was happening, the OSU theory team carried out large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. John Herbert, professor of chemistry and leader of the theory effort, explained: \"We found that the PhF-methanol mixture is subtly different from the others. The electronegativity of the F atom promotes a 'molecular handshake' (or hydrogen bond) with the O-H end of methanol, whereas in other mixtures the distribution of the PhX molecules is more random.\" In short, fluorobenzene forms a more organized solvation structure than the other halobenzenes.\n\nThe LSU theory group then investigated whether this arrangement could explain the experimental results. Mette Gaarde, Boyd Professor of Physics, said: \"We speculated that the electron density around the F atoms was providing an extra barrier for the accelerating electrons to scatter on, and that this would disturb the harmonic generation process.\" Using a model based on the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the researchers confirmed that such a scattering barrier could account for both the missing harmonic and the reduced overall light output. \"We also learned that the suppression was very sensitive to the location of the barrier -- this means that the detail of the harmonic suppression carries information about the local structure that was formed during the solvation process,\" added Sucharita Giri, postdoctoral researcher at LSU.\n\n\"We were excited to be able to combine results from experiment and theory, across physics, chemistry, and optics, to learn something new about electron dynamics in the complex liquid environment.\" Mette Gaarde, LSU Boyd Professor of Physics\n\nWhy This Discovery Matters\n\nAlthough more work is needed to fully explore what HHS can reveal in liquids, the early results are encouraging. Many of the most important chemical and biological processes take place in liquid environments. The energies of the electrons involved are also similar to those responsible for radiation damage. Gaining a clearer picture of how electrons scatter in dense liquids could therefore have broad implications for chemistry, biology, and materials science.\n\nAs DiMauro noted, \"Our results demonstrate that solution-phase high-harmonic generation can be sensitive to the particular solute-solvent interactions and therefore to the local liquid environment. We are excited for the future of this field.\" Researchers expect that continued advances in experiments and simulations will expand the use of this technique and provide increasingly detailed views of how liquids respond to ultrafast laser pulses.\n\nKey contributors to this work include Eric Moore, Andreas Koutsogiannis, Tahereh Alavi, and Greg McCracken from OSU; and Kenneth Lopata from LSU.

These fast changes are important in many areas like biology and chemistry, but they have been hard to study because liquids don’t have a fixed shape and their molecules move too fast for most tools to see.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from Ohio State University and Louisiana State University used a special laser technique called high-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) to watch how molecules interact inside liquids. They created a very thin sheet of liquid to let the laser light pass through and studied mixtures of methanol with nearly identical chemicals called halobenzenes. One mixture, methanol with fluorobenzene, behaved differently by producing less light and missing a specific light signal.

      "content": "Researchers at Google have used their Willow quantum computer to demonstrate that \"quantum contextuality\" may be a crucial ingredient for its computational prowess\n\nGoogle’s Willow quantum computer Google Quantum AI\n\nWhat is it about quantum computers that makes them more powerful than conventional machines? A new experiment shows that the property of “quantum contextuality” may be a key ingredient.\n\nQuantum computers are fundamentally different from all other computers because they harness uniquely quantum phenomena absent from conventional electronics. For instance, their building blocks, which are called qubits, are routinely put into superposition states – they seemingly assume two properties at once that are normally mutually exclusive – or they get connected through the inextricable link of quantum entanglement.\n\nNow, researchers at Google Quantum AI have used their Willow quantum computer to carry out several demonstrations showing that the property of quantum contextuality also plays a significant role.\n\nQuantum contextuality captures an oddity about measuring the properties of quantum objects. While the colour of a pen, say, isn’t affected by whether you measure it before or after measuring the length of the pen, for a quantum object, the results of measurements cannot be treated as pre-existing properties that are independent of all other measurements.\n\nThis contextuality has previously been studied in specialised experiments with quantum light, and in 2018, a team of researchers mathematically proved that it could also be used in a quantum computing algorithm.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Daily The latest on what’s new in science and why it matters each day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nNotably, this algorithm would allow a quantum computer to find a mathematical formula hidden within a bigger mathematical object in a fixed number of steps, regardless of how large that object gets. In other words, quantum contextuality enables something akin to finding a needle in a haystack regardless of the haystack’s size.\n\nGoogle’s experiment implemented this algorithm on an increasing number of qubits, from just a few up to 105, equivalent to growing the haystack. Because Willow has more noise, meaning it is less error-free, than the ideal theoretical quantum computer the algorithm was written for, the number of steps did increase with the qubit number. However, Willow still used fewer steps than the researchers estimated that a traditional computer would need.\n\nIn this way, quantum contextuality seems to lead towards quantum advantage – a case of a quantum computer leveraging its quantumness to beat the performance of classical devices. Additionally, the team implemented several other quantum computing protocols that hinge on quantum contextuality and found its effects to be stronger than in previous studies.\n\n“When I first heard about this, I said that it cannot be true. It is quite amazing,” says Adán Cabello at the University of Seville in Spain.\n\n“These results clearly demonstrate how current quantum computers are pushing the boundaries of experimental quantum physics,” says Vir Bulchandani at Rice University in Texas. He says any quantum computer that is a candidate for useful quantum advantage ought to be able to perform these tasks, as a benchmark of its quantum character.\n\nHowever, the demonstration isn’t yet a proof of a quantum advantage that could be put to practical use because the 2018 algorithm rigorously proved the quantum computer’s superiority over classical computers only for a larger number of qubits than Willow has, and by using qubits that are less error-prone, says Daniel Lidar at the University of Southern California. The next step may be to connect the new work with quantum error-correction algorithms, he says.\n\nIn addition to offering a new benchmark for quantum computers, this experiment also underscores the importance of the most fundamental aspects of quantum physics. Cabello says researchers still lack a comprehensive theory of what exactly causes quantum advantage, but unlike entanglement, which often has to be created, contextuality is, in a way, built into quantum objects. Quantum computers such as Willow are now good enough to force us to take the strangeness of quantum physics really seriously, he says.",

      "content": "An analysis of several experiments aimed at detecting the mysterious neutrino has identified a hint of a crack in the standard model of particle physics\n\nNeutrinos rarely interact with normal matter Shutterstock / betibup33\n\nNotoriously ghostly particles called neutrinos may have revealed a crack in our understanding of all the particles and forces in the universe.\n\nThe standard model of particle physics, which catalogues all the particles and forces we know to exist, is one of the biggest successes of modern physics, but physicists have also spent decades trying to break it. That is because it has enough flaws – notably, it doesn’t connect gravity to any of the three other fundamental forces – for researchers to suspect that they must formulate another, better model.\n\nIf the standard model cracks under a stress test, that would point to where we should start building this next model. Francesca Dordei at the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) in Cagliari and her colleagues have now identified one possible crack by studying the enigmatic neutrino.\n\n“In all the checks [of the standard model] that we did in the last two decades, every time, stubbornly, they confirmed the standard model, which means that we have to go to even more precise results. In this sense, neutrinos are special particles,” says Dordei.\n\nFor one, neutrinos have incredibly small masses – so small that physicists once thought they were massless. What’s more, they are weakly interacting, which means they pass through objects and bodies undetected, like tiny ghosts. Yet careful study has pinpointed some small electromagnetic interactions that neutrinos take part in, which can be quantified through a number called charge radius. Neutrinos can also interact with other particles through the weak nuclear force.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Lost in Space-Time Untangle mind-bending physics, maths and the weirdness of reality with our monthly, special-guest-written newsletter. Sign up to newsletter\n\nDordei and her colleagues examined the details of that interaction and of the neutrinos’ charge radius across the many experiments that have looked for signs of these elusive particles in recent years. For instance, they combined data from observations of neutrinos created in nuclear reactors, particle accelerators and fusion processes inside the sun. The team also took advantage of the fact that some detectors built for dark matter – the mysterious substance that permeates the cosmos – are sensitive to neutrinos as well.\n\nTeam member Nicola Cargioli, also at INFN, says putting all this data together was challenging, but provided a powerful overview of everything we know about neutrinos. “We have used basically all of the data [there is],” says Christoph Ternes at the Gran Sasso Science Institute in L’Aquila, Italy, who also worked on the project.\n\nThe value of the neutrinos’ charge radius didn’t deviate from the predictions of the standard model, but the researchers found something more exciting when they looked at the particle’s weak interactions. Here, they identified a “mathematical degeneracy”, which means that both the standard model and a slightly different model could have produced the same observations. Strikingly, further analysis showed that this alternative to the standard model may fit the data slightly better, possibly indicating the long-sought-after crack in our current understanding of particle physics.\n\nThe new analysis doesn’t statistically reach the level of an unambiguous discovery, and the researchers see it as a first step in stress-testing the standard model with neutrinos. They hope to acquire more data that could add weight to – or dispel – their current results as new detectors come online in the next few years. However, if this crack persists in the future, it could have serious ramifications.\n\n“If we have found a crack, then we may have to rethink everything,” says Cargioli. For example, a new model that went beyond the standard model could include some completely new kinds of particles whose interaction with neutrinos would match up with the analysis in the team’s study.\n\nOmar Miranda at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico says measuring neutrinos’ interactions, especially at very low energy, as is the case for much of the data in the new study, is very challenging and has only recently become possible thanks to advances in detector technology, including detectors for dark matter. This has really highlighted the relevance of neutrino detection as a test of the standard model, he says.\n\nThe new analysis presents a plea to particle physicists for more ultra-precise experiments with neutrinos in different settings in the future, says José Valle at the University of Valencia in Spain. Better measurements of neutrinos’ electromagnetic properties are also still necessary, as they would shed light on, for instance, neutrinos’ internal structure, he says.\n\nJournal reference: Physical Review Letters DOI: 10.1103/dplq-dvc8",

      "title": "Physicists found hidden order in violent proton collisions",
      "summary": "Inside high-energy proton collisions, quarks and gluons briefly form a dense, boiling state before cooling into ordinary particles. Researchers expected this transition to change how disordered the system is, but LHC data tell a different story. A newly improved collision model matches experiments better than older ones and reveals that the “entropy” remains unchanged throughout the process. This unexpected result turns out to be a direct fingerprint of quantum mechanics at work.",
      "content": "High energy proton collisions can be pictured as a roiling sea of quarks and gluons, including short lived virtual particles. At first glance, this extreme environment seems far more complex than the later stage, when fewer and more stable particles fly outward from the collision point. One might expect particles in this early phase to behave very differently. But data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show that this intuition is misleading. The results are better explained by a refined model that captures how proton collisions truly unfold.\n\nWhen two protons collide at very high energies, an enormous amount happens in an instant. Protons are hadrons, meaning they are made of partons, which include quarks and the gluons that hold them together. During a collision, these quarks and gluons, including virtual ones that appear only briefly, interact in complicated ways. As the system cools, quarks combine to form new hadrons that scatter outward and are detected by experiments. Based on this picture, it seems reasonable to assume that the disorder of the system, known as entropy, should change between the early parton phase and the later hadron phase. The parton stage looks especially chaotic, with many particles interacting at once.\n\nNew Research on Entropy in Proton Collisions\n\nThe latest findings on this question were published in Physical Review D by Prof. Krzysztof Kutak and Dr. Sandor Lokos from the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN) in Cracow. Their work focuses on comparing entropy in the early quark gluon phase with the entropy of the particles eventually produced and measured.\n\n\"In high-energy physics, so-called dipole models have been used for some time to describe the evolution of dense gluon systems. These models assume that each gluon can be represented by a quark-antiquark pair that forms a dipole of two colors -- here we are not talking about ordinary colours, but the colour charge that is a quantum property of gluons. Dipole models based on the average number of hadrons produced in a collision allow us to estimate the entropy of partons,\" explains Prof. Kutak, who has studied the entropy of quark gluon systems for more than ten years.\n\nImproving Dipole Models With New Ideas\n\nTwo years ago, Prof. Kutak and Dr. Pawel Caputa of Stockholm University introduced an updated version of the dipole model. They started with an established model that describes how gluon systems evolve and treated it as the dominant contribution. They then added additional effects that become important at lower collision energies, where fewer hadrons are produced. This advance was possible because the researchers identified links between the equations used in dipole models and those found in complexity theory.\n\nTo test this generalized dipole model, Dr. Lokos suggested comparing it with real experimental data from the LHC. Measurements from the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments were included. Together, these data span a broad range of collision energies, from 0.2 teraelectronvolts up to 13 TeV, which is the highest energy currently achievable at the LHC.\n\n\"In our article, we show that the generalized dipole model describes the existing data more accurately than previous dipole models and, moreover, works well in a wider range of proton collision energies,\" Prof. Kutak says.\n\nEntropy and a Core Rule of Quantum Mechanics\n\nThis raises a key question. Does the entropy during the quark and gluon dominated phase of a proton collision differ from the entropy of the hadrons that later escape the collision zone? According to the Kharzeev-Levin formula for entropy, it should not. The new analysis confirms this prediction. While this result surprises some physicists, others see it as a natural outcome of one of the most basic principles of quantum mechanics known as unitarity.\n\nUnitarity may sound abstract, but the idea itself is straightforward. The equations that describe how a quantum system evolves over time must conserve total probability, which always adds up to one, and they must allow processes to be reversed. Put simply, unitarity means that information and probability cannot disappear or appear from nothing.\n\n\"The unitarity of quantum mechanics is something that physics students learn about. The formalism of quantum chromodynamics, the theory describing the world of quarks and gluons, is based on unitarity. However, it is one thing to deal with a theory that exhibits a certain feature at the level of quarks and gluons on a daily basis, and quite another to observe it in real data on produced hadrons,\" Prof. Kutak notes. He adds that unitarity makes it possible to extract information about parton entropy across a wide range of collision energies.\n\nWhat Comes Next for Testing the Model\n\nFurther tests of the generalized dipole model are expected in the coming years. After the planned upgrade of the LHC, the improved ALICE detector will be able to study regions where gluon interactions are even denser than those examined so far. Additional insights are also expected from the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), now under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the USA. At the EIC, electrons will collide with protons. Because electrons are elementary particles, these experiments will offer a clearer way to probe dense gluon systems inside individual protons.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – When protons smash together at very high speeds, their inside parts called quarks and gluons create a hot, chaotic mix before cooling down into stable particles. Scientists thought this change would alter the system’s disorder, known as entropy.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from the Polish Academy of Sciences improved a model called the dipole model to better describe how these proton collisions unfold. They tested it using data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, covering a wide range of collision energies. Their model showed that the entropy stays the same from the early quark-gluon stage to the final particles.\n\n**Impact** – This finding is surprising because the early stage looks very chaotic, but the disorder does not actually increase. This matches a key rule of quantum mechanics called unitarity, which says that information cannot be lost or gained in these processes. Seeing this rule clearly reflected in real data helps scientists understand the quantum world better.\n\n**What's next step** – The team plans to test their model more with upcoming experiments. The LHC is being upgraded to study even denser gluon systems, and a new Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) in the USA will provide clearer data by colliding electrons with protons.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New research shows that the disorder in proton collisions stays constant, revealing a fundamental quantum rule in action and improving our understanding of particle physics.",
