      "summary": "UC Davis researchers engineered wheat that encourages soil bacteria to convert atmospheric nitrogen into plant-usable fertilizer. By boosting a natural compound in the plant, the wheat triggers bacteria to form biofilms that enable nitrogen fixation. This breakthrough could cut fertilizer use, reduce pollution, and increase yields. It also offers huge potential savings for farmers worldwide.",
      "content": "Scientists at the University of California, Davis, have created wheat plants capable of promoting the formation of their own fertilizer, a development that could lower global air and water pollution and reduce farming expenses.\n\nThe work comes from a research group directed by Eduardo Blumwald, a distinguished professor in the Department of Plant Sciences. Using the gene-editing tool CRISPR, the team increased the plant's production of one of its natural chemicals. When wheat roots release this extra compound into the surrounding soil, it assists specific bacteria that can convert nitrogen from the air into a form that nearby plants can absorb. This process is known as nitrogen fixation.\n\nThe research was published in Plant Biotechnology Journal.\n\nPotential Benefits for Food Security\n\nFor many developing regions, this advancement could offer new support for reliable crop production.\n\n\"In Africa, people don't use fertilizers because they don't have money, and farms are small, not larger than six to eight acres,\" Blumwald said. \"Imagine, you are planting crops that stimulate bacteria in the soil to create the fertilizer that the crops need, naturally. Wow! That's a big difference!\"\n\nThis wheat innovation builds on the group's previous success in rice, and similar work is underway to expand the technique to other major cereal crops.\n\nThe Global Fertilizer Problem\n\nWheat ranks as the world's second most productive cereal and accounts for the largest share of nitrogen fertilizer use, about 18% of the global total. In 2020, more than 800 million tons of fertilizer were manufactured worldwide, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nPlants typically absorb only 30 to 50% of applied nitrogen fertilizer. The remainder often runs into rivers and coastal areas, contributing to oxygen-depleted \"dead zones\" that harm aquatic ecosystems. Additional surplus nitrogen in soil can produce nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nWhy Wheat Needs a Different Strategy\n\nNitrogen-fixing bacteria generate an enzyme called nitrogenase, sometimes referred to as the \"fixer\" because it carries out nitrogen fixation. The enzyme functions only within these bacteria and only in low-oxygen environments.\n\nLegumes such as beans and peas naturally form root nodules, specialized structures that create the oxygen-poor conditions these bacteria require.\n\nWheat and most other crops lack these nodules, which is why synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is widely used.\n\n\"For decades, scientists have been trying to develop cereal crops that produce active root nodules, or trying to colonize cereals with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, without much success. We used a different approach,\" Blumwald said. \"We said the location of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria is not important, so long as the fixed nitrogen can reach the plant, and the plant can use it.\"\n\nHow the UC Davis Team Found a Workable Solution\n\nThe researchers examined 2,800 chemicals naturally made by plants and identified 20 that could encourage nitrogen-fixing bacteria to form biofilms. These biofilms are sticky coatings that wrap around the bacteria, producing a low-oxygen microenvironment suitable for nitrogenase activity. The team then mapped how plants synthesize these compounds and identified the genes involved.\n\nWith this information, they used CRISPR to adjust wheat plants so they generated larger amounts of one compound in particular, a flavone called apigenin. Because the plants produce more apigenin than they need, the surplus is released into the soil. In experiments, this apigenin stimulated soil bacteria to form protective biofilms, enabling nitrogenase to fix nitrogen in a usable form that the wheat could absorb.\n\nUnder very low nitrogen fertilizer conditions, the modified wheat also produced higher yields compared to control plants.\n\nLarge Economic Gains for Farmers\n\nFarmers in the United States spent nearly $36 billion on fertilizers in 2023, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Blumwald notes that about 500 million acres in the country are planted with cereals.\n\n\"Imagine, if you could save 10% of the amount of fertilizer being used on that land,\" he pondered. \"I'm calculating conservatively: That should be a savings of more than a billion dollars every year.\"\n\nOther authors include Hiromi Tajima, Akhilesh Yadav, Javier Hidalgo Castellanos, Dawei Yan, Benjamin P. Brookbank and Eiji Nambara.\n\nThe University of California has filed a patent application, which is now pending. Bayer Crop Science and the UC Davis Will Lester Endowment provided funding for the work.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Wheat is one of the world’s most important crops, but it usually needs a lot of fertilizer to grow well. Fertilizers are costly and can pollute rivers and air when used too much. Unlike some plants such as beans, wheat cannot naturally fix nitrogen from the air because it lacks special root structures.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of California, Davis used a gene-editing tool called CRISPR to change wheat plants so they produce more of a natural chemical called apigenin. This chemical helps certain soil bacteria form protective layers called biofilms. These biofilms create a low-oxygen environment where bacteria can turn nitrogen from the air into a form that wheat can use as fertilizer.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery means wheat can get some of its fertilizer naturally, which could reduce the amount of synthetic fertilizer farmers need to buy. Using less fertilizer can lower pollution in water and air and reduce farming costs. This is especially helpful for farmers in poorer regions, like parts of Africa, where fertilizers are expensive or hard to get. The modified wheat also showed higher crop yields when grown with less fertilizer.\n\n**What’s next step** – The research team plans to apply this method to other cereal crops like rice and maize. The University of California has filed a patent for this technology, and further testing and development will be needed before it can be widely used by farmers.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have created wheat that encourages helpful soil bacteria to produce natural fertilizer, potentially cutting costs and pollution while boosting crop growth worldwide.",

Les engrais sont coûteux et peuvent polluer les rivières et l’air lorsqu’ils sont trop utilisés. Contrairement à certaines plantes comme les haricots, le blé ne peut pas naturellement fixer l’azote de l’air car il ne possède pas de structures racinaires spéciales.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs de l’Université de Californie à Davis ont utilisé un outil d’édition génétique appelé CRISPR pour modifier le blé afin qu’il produise plus d’une substance naturelle appelée apigénine. Cette substance aide certaines bactéries du sol à former des couches protectrices appelées biofilms. Ces biofilms créent un environnement pauvre en oxygène où les bactéries peuvent transformer l’azote de l’air en une forme que le blé peut utiliser comme engrais.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte signifie que le blé peut obtenir une partie de son engrais naturellement, ce qui pourrait réduire la quantité d’engrais synthétique que les agriculteurs doivent acheter. Utiliser moins d’engrais peut diminuer la pollution de l’eau et de l’air et réduire les coûts agricoles. Cela est particulièrement utile pour les agriculteurs dans les régions pauvres, comme en Afrique, où les engrais sont chers ou difficiles à trouver. Le blé modifié a aussi montré des rendements plus élevés avec moins d’engrais.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L’équipe de recherche prévoit d’appliquer cette méthode à d’autres céréales comme le riz et le maïs.

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 24 November 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03858-zEconomists should consider forests and wetlands as well as factories and farms.",
      "content": "On Natural Capital: The Value of the World Around Us Partha Dasgupta Witness (2025)\n\nAn economist might celebrate a nation achieving record economic growth on one day, yet overlook a coral reef lying bleached and lifeless on another. This contradiction must be challenged, writes economist Partha Dasgupta in his elegant account of why the global economic system is exploiting, rather than sustaining, life on our planet.\n\nOn Natural Capital recaps the roaring economic advances of the past 75 years, including improved life expectancies and education and fewer people living in poverty. But it also shares how economic progress has benefited from the exploitation of our planet: an ecological debt that conventional accounting leaves off the balance sheet.\n\nHow to build nature back better — read this manual\n\nDasgupta starts by vividly portraying the essential workings of Earth’s life-support systems and how living processes regulate the climate, replenish soils and sustain food webs. He notes that one-third of the planet’s remaining wetlands, which are crucial for filtering nutrients, providing flood protection and storing carbon, have been lost between 1970 and 2015 owing to infrastructure construction, urban expansion and other human activities. He also describes how deforestation can create savannah-like conditions in parts of the tropics, because the disruption of moisture-recycling processes decreases rainfall and ecological productivity.\n\nNext, Dasgupta examines why economic principles have long treated nature’s functions as background scenery. He explains that this omission is rooted in the mid-twentieth-century origins of growth and development economics, in which economists constructed models that explained output using only human labour and skills, and physical goods. This was a reasonable assumption back when natural resources seemed abundant, the world wasn’t pressing against planetary limits and forests, soils and fisheries seemed too plentiful to constrain growth. What began as a practical simplification evolved into a blind spot.\n\nUneasy trade-offs\n\nBy stitching these two narratives together, Dasgupta succeeds in portraying woodlands, watersheds and wild species as bona fide assets, the depletion of which undermines the prosperity statistics that governments use to track and celebrate progress. He solidifies this narrative by estimating that humanity’s collective demand on nature now exceeds the planet’s regenerative capacity by around 70%. Effectively, this means that, since the early 1970s, we have been living off the planet’s ‘capital’ rather than the accrued ‘interest’, jeopardizing our biosphere’s solvency.\n\nBeyond growth — why we need to agree on an alternative to GDP now\n\nAs Dasgupta’s writing flows between nature’s processes and economic principles, he stresses the uneasy trade-offs that societies navigate daily. Each tonne of fish landed or cubic metre of water taken for irrigation is a draw on assets that must remain intact to avoid compromising future yields of food, income and ecological stability.\n\nDasgupta reminds us that these choices are not simply about extraction but also about stewardship. Overfishing might boost a nation’s gross domestic product for one fiscal quarter, yet deplete the reproductive stock that sustains the following year’s catch. Likewise, draining wetlands to generate farmland might bring an immediate harvest, yet erode the flood protection and nutrient-cycling processes that make such agriculture possible.\n\nSustainable forestry management preserves biodiversity and allows forests to regenerate.Credit: Alexander Manzyuk/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nThe constant tension between nature’s bounty and the ecological conditions that make that bounty possible is revealed brilliantly by Dasgupta but left out of the accounting practices that currently define progress. As a result, society perceives the conversion of natural resources as costless profit and celebrates growth figures, but the natural systems that made that growth possible decline quietly.\n\nDasgupta’s call to put nature on the balance sheet is timely precisely because it indicates a rapidly expanding movement in policy that is beginning to give the natural world the accounting treatment it has often lacked.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nCountries such as the Netherlands, Canada and Colombia are developing or trialling natural-capital accounting and statistical frameworks that treat ecosystems as assets: measuring their stock (for example, wetlands, forests and soil microorganisms), tracking their depreciation (or appreciation) and defining the ‘interest’ they generate, such as flood protection and carbon storage.\n\nEnvironmental politics is doomed to fail — unless we tell better stories\n\nIn the corporate domain, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures is a market-led, government-supported and science-based global initiative that encourages companies to include nature in their financial reports. It provides firms with a framework for disclosing nature-related risks, including biodiversity loss, as well as dependencies, such as supply-chain access to clean water.\n\nDasgupta highlights both the promise of natural-capital accounting as well as the areas that need improvement. Markets are finally aligning with the reality that woodlands, watersheds, wildlife and other aspects of the natural world are not ‘free’ inputs but assets, and their degradation erodes prosperity. The gaps, he emphasizes, lie in the valuation of natural systems (how to reliably price ecosystem services), governance (who owns and manages those assets) and integration (how to incorporate natural-capital metrics into macroeconomic indicators).",

      "content": "While continental in scale, the ozone hole over the Antarctic was small in 2025 compared to previous years and remains on track to recover later this century, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported. The hole this year was the fifth smallest since 1992, the year a landmark international agreement to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals began to take effect.\n\nAt the height of this year’s depletion season from Sept. 7 through Oct. 13, the average extent of the ozone hole was about 7.23 million square miles (18.71 million square kilometers) — that’s twice the area of the contiguous United States. The 2025 ozone hole is already breaking up, nearly three weeks earlier than usual during the past decade.\n\nThis map shows the size and shape of the ozone hole over the South Pole on the day of its 2025 maximum extent. Moderate ozone losses (orange) are visible amid areas of more potent ozone losses (red). Scientists describe the ozone “hole” as the area in which ozone concentrations drop below the historical threshold of 220 Dobson units. NASA Earth Observatory image by Lauren Dauphin, using data courtesy of NASA Ozone Watch and GEOS-5 data from the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office at NASA GSFC\n\nThe hole reached its greatest one-day extent for the year on Sept. 9 at 8.83 million square miles (22.86 million square kilometers). It was about 30% smaller than the largest hole ever observed, which occurred in 2006, and had an average area of 10.27 million square miles (26.60 million square kilometers).\n\n“As predicted, we’re seeing ozone holes trending smaller in area than they were in the early 2000s,” said Paul Newman, a senior scientist with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and leader of the ozone research team at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “They’re forming later in the season and breaking up earlier. But we still have a long way to go before it recovers to 1980s levels.”\n\nNASA and NOAA scientists say this year’s monitoring showed that controls on ozone-depleting chemical compounds established by the Montreal Protocol and subsequent amendments are driving the gradual recovery of the ozone layer in the stratosphere, which remains on track to recover fully later this century.\n\nThe ozone-rich layer acts as a planetary sunscreen that helps shield life from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. It is located in the stratosphere, which is found between 7 and 31 miles above the Earth’s surface. Reduced ozone allows more UV rays to reach the surface, resulting in crop damage as well as increased cases of skin cancer and cataracts, among other adverse health impacts.\n\nThe ozone depletion process starts when human-made compounds containing chlorine and bromine rise high into the stratosphere miles above Earth’s surface. Freed from their molecular bonds by the more intense UV radiation, the chlorine and bromine-containing molecules then participate in reactions that destroy ozone molecules. Chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting compounds were once widely used in aerosol sprays, foams, air conditioners, and refrigerators. The chlorine and bromine from these compounds can linger in the atmosphere for decades to centuries.\n\n“Since peaking around the year 2000, levels of ozone-depleting substances in the Antarctic stratosphere have declined by about a third, relative to pre-ozone-hole levels,” said Stephen Montzka, a senior scientist with NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory.\n\nAs part of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, countries agreed to replace ozone-depleting substances with less harmful alternatives.\n\n“This year’s hole would have been more than one million square miles larger if there was still as much chlorine in the stratosphere as there was 25 years ago,” Newman said.\n\nStill, the now-banned chemicals persist in old products like building insulation and in landfills. As emissions from those legacy uses taper off over time, projections show the ozone hole over the Antarctic recovering around the late 2060s.\n\nNASA and NOAA previously ranked ozone hole severity using a time frame dating back to 1979, when scientists began tracking Antarctic ozone levels with satellites. Using that longer record, this year’s hole area ranked 14th smallest over 46 years of observations.\n\nFactors like temperature, weather, and the strength of the wind encircling Antarctica known as the polar vortex also influence ozone levels from year to year. A weaker-than-normal polar vortex this August helped keep temperatures above average and likely contributed to a smaller ozone hole, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.\n\nResearchers monitor the ozone layer around the world using instruments on NASA’s Aura satellite, the NOAA-20 and NOAA-21 satellites, and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, jointly operated by NASA and NOAA.\n\nNOAA scientists also use instruments carried on weather balloons and upward-looking surface-based instruments to measure stratospheric ozone directly above the South Pole Atmospheric Baseline Observatory. Balloon data showed that the ozone concentration reached its lowest value of 147 Dobson Units this year on Oct. 6. The lowest value ever recorded over the South Pole was 92 Dobson Units in October 2006.\n\nNOAA scientists launch a weather balloon carrying an ozonesonde near the South Pole in September 2025.

En 1987, plusieurs pays ont signé le Protocole de Montréal pour arrêter leur utilisation.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – En 2025, le trou dans la couche d’ozone au-dessus de l’Antarctique était le cinquième plus petit depuis 1992, ont rapporté la NASA et la NOAA. Au plus grand de sa taille le 9 septembre, il couvrait environ 8,83 millions de miles carrés—soit deux fois la taille des États-Unis—mais 30 % plus petit que le plus grand trou observé en 2006. Le trou a aussi commencé à se réduire près de trois semaines plus tôt que d’habitude.\n\n**Impact** – Ce trou plus petit montre que le Protocole de Montréal fonctionne, avec moins de substances nocives dans l’atmosphère. Depuis 2000, les substances qui détruisent l’ozone dans la stratosphère antarctique ont diminué d’environ un tiers. Un trou plus petit signifie une meilleure protection contre les rayons UV, ce qui réduit les risques comme le cancer de la peau et les dommages aux cultures.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques s’attendent à ce que le trou d’ozone continue de rétrécir et soit complètement rétabli vers la fin des années 2060. Ils continueront de surveiller les niveaux d’ozone avec des satellites et des ballons météo pour suivre les progrès et comprendre l’influence des conditions météorologiques chaque année.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – Grâce aux accords mondiaux, le trou dans la couche d’ozone antarctique de 2025 est beaucoup plus petit que dans les décennies passées, montrant une récupération régulière de cette couche protectrice essentielle.\n",
      "personality_title_es": "El agujero de ozono antártico de 2025 es el quinto más pequeño desde 1992",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – El agujero de ozono es un adelgazamiento de la capa de ozono sobre la Antártida, monitoreado desde 1979. El ozono protege la Tierra al bloquear los dañinos rayos ultravioleta (UV) del Sol. Los clorofluorocarbonos (CFC), usados antes en aerosoles y refrigeradores, causaron el agujero al destruir el ozono. En 1987, países firmaron el Protocolo de Montreal para dejar de usar estos químicos.\n\n**Qué pasó** – En 2025, el agujero de ozono sobre la Antártida fue el quinto más pequeño desde 1992, reportaron la NASA y la NOAA. En su máximo el 9 de septiembre, cubrió unos 8.83 millones de millas cuadradas—el doble del tamaño de Estados Unidos—pero un 30 % más pequeño que el mayor agujero registrado en 2006. Además, comenzó a reducirse casi tres semanas antes de lo habitual.\n\n**Impacto** – Este agujero más pequeño muestra que el Protocolo de Montreal está funcionando, con menos sustancias dañinas en la atmósfera. Desde 2000, las sustancias que dañan el ozono en la estratosfera antártica han disminuido en un tercio. Un agujero más pequeño significa más protección contra los rayos UV, lo que ayuda a reducir riesgos como el cáncer de piel y el daño a los cultivos.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos esperan que el agujero siga reduciéndose y se recupere completamente hacia finales de la década de 2060. Seguirán monitoreando los niveles de ozono con satélites y globos meteorológicos para seguir el progreso y entender cómo el clima afecta al agujero cada año.\n\n**Frase clave** – Gracias a acuerdos globales, el agujero de ozono antártico en 2025 es mucho más pequeño que en décadas anteriores, señalando una recuperación constante de esta capa protectora vital.\n",

      "content": "Subscribe to receive transcripts by email. Read along with this episode.\n\nWhat if the solution to winter’s infrastructure corrosion and environmentally benign home sidewalk de-icing was an invasive starfish being thrown back into Korea’s coastal waters? Hando Choi, president of Star’s Tech, joins the conversation to explain how one region’s invasive species problem can become another’s environmental breakthrough. The company developed ECO-ST, a de-icing product made from starfish skeletons that not only melts ice faster than conventional rock salt but also reduces the chloride pollution that causes billions of dollars in damage to roads, bridges, and vehicles every winter.\n\nMeanwhile, in Korean waters, the Northern Pacific sea star has become such a menace to shellfish aquaculture that the government purchases 3,000 to 4,000 tons annually to control populations. Stars Tech upcycles about 10% of that collected material, extracting the porous calcium carbonate structures that give starfish their shape and their remarkable ability to store and release chloride. The technology began as a high school science project when founder and chief scientist Seungchan Yang experimented with natural pore structures to control ion release, eventually connecting that research to the negative impacts of conventional deicers while studying at Seoul National University.\n\nThe economic case is compelling once you factor in the full cost of ownership. While ECO-ST runs $465 to $650 per ton compared to $100 to $150 for commodity rock salt, salt itself accounts for less than 5% of most winter maintenance budgets. The Isaac Walton League of America estimates that infrastructure damage from road salt ranges from $30 to $300 per ton used. Stars Tech’s simulations based on U.S. municipal data show ECO-ST can deliver up to 5,000% ROI over time when lower infrastructure maintenance costs, fewer reapplications, and ESG compliance benefits are factored in.\n\nECO-ST is available on Amazon in the U.S. and Canada, with retail partnerships launching this winter.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Every winter, roads and sidewalks are often covered with rock salt to melt ice. But this salt causes damage to bridges, vehicles, and the environment because of its high chloride content. In Korea, an invasive starfish species has also been harming shellfish farms and coastal waters.\n\n**What happened** – A Korean company called Star’s Tech invented a new de-icing product named ECO-ST, made from the skeletons of these invasive starfish. The product melts ice faster than regular salt but uses less harmful chloride. The idea started as a high school science project and grew into a real business that now sells ECO-ST in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n**Impact** – ECO-ST helps reduce pollution caused by traditional salt while protecting infrastructure from costly damage. Even though it costs more per ton than rock salt, it saves money over time by reducing repairs and needing fewer applications. Using starfish skeletons also helps control the invasive species harming Korean waters.\n\n**What's next step** – This winter, ECO-ST will be available in stores through new retail partnerships, expanding its reach. The company hopes more cities and communities will adopt their product to protect roads and the environment.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A clever use of invasive starfish turns a harmful problem into a safer, more sustainable way to melt ice on roads and sidewalks.",
