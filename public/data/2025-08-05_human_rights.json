      "content": "Deborah Daley 00:06\n\nHello and welcome to Changemakers, a podcast series brought to you by Nature, where we shine a light on fascinating and extraordinary scientists. I’m Deborah Daley, global chair of Springer Nature’s Black Employee Network, and I’m very proud to present this series where we explore exclusion in science and how some researchers are doing something about it.\n\nIn episode five, we meet an Iranian environmental scientist who struck up an unlikely partnership with NASA and created, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for her minority students.\n\nArezoo Khodayari 00:52\n\nI’m Arezoo Khodayari, associate professor of environmental engineering at California State University Los Angeles, which is a beautiful campus in west coast of United States.\n\nI’m also an affiliate to NASA JPL Jet Propulsion Lab, where I work with my collaborators to create a pipeline program that can take Cal State LA student to NASA JPL, to work on NASA-related projects.\n\nI grew up in Iran, and, you know, I was always a very curious kid, a kid that had questions about everything, especially anything to do with universe.\n\nI was the kid that was always asking so many questions during every class from every teacher.\n\nSo everybody, every teacher knew me by name, because I was the one that was asking all these questions.\n\nI’m a first generation college student, so I was, you know, the first one in my family that went to college, so I had to navigate all the challenges of being a first generation college student on my own.\n\nSo I learned everything the hard way, but it was, you know, that gave me a deeper understanding of all the challenges that a student in my situation could go through. And at the age of 24 I thought I want to do something more.\n\nI want to do something out of my comfort zone, and I want to pursue higher education at the university that’s best of best, if possible.\n\nSo that gave me the idea of coming to US to pursue my PhD at the University of Illinois, at Urbana Champaign.\n\nSo then I emigrated to US, and that was a new journey, a new challenge, that I had to again navigate everything on my own.\n\nThat was also a very rewarding experience, because for a 24-year-old girl that was never away from family, now living on my own, navigating the immigration challenge on my own, learning how to be a student in a new school system. And all that was a lot. But an amazing learning experience.\n\nWhen I was doing my PhD, I came to meet my PhD advisor, who was one of the pioneers in the field of climate change, and he was such a great mentor that he kind of instilled the love of science for me even more, especially the love, for the love of science for climate change.\n\nBecause I could see through his work and my own experience of living in this current time how climate change is important and how science can help humanity to recover from all the damages that have been caused by climate change or to work for a better future.\n\nSo then, you know, after doing my PhD, I did my postdoctorate with him, under his supervision, and I focused on climate change for my post doctorate. And you know, during that time, I also developed a love of teaching, I discovered that teaching is my true passion.\n\nI would like a career that involves teaching, involves research to, you know, research, questions, answers to all the questions I had in mind.\n\nSo I figured out that academia is the perfect place for me. I can, you know, I can, you know, be involved with teaching, which is my true passion.\n\nI can help a student with their own curiosity and their questions that they had for anything related to science, while I can research my own questions and work on my own projects.\n\nYou know, astrobiology is a discipline that deals with how life formed on planet Earth, or how life could exist, evolve or distribute in various environments in other planets.\n\nIt combines disciplines such as chemistry, biology, physics and planetary science to investigate the question of life.\n\nWhat are the conditions that can sustain life, and if life could exist on other planets and in moon. Astrobiology is focused on chemical conditions that supported life on planet Earth, or chemical conditions that could support life on other planets.\n\nThese chemical conditions are conditions that we do study in environmental engineering and chemical engineering.\n\nSo basically in chemical, environmental science, environmental engineering, we study how different chemical processes could improve the quality of life.\n\nSo basically, I can say environmental science and astrobiology, they both share the focus of ecosystems and habitability of planets.\n\nSo we can basically study both fields by tweaking the chemical conditions of our experiments.\n\nIn short, I can say environmental science is basically astrobiology on cosmic level. They both have chemistry in common. They both share the focus of ecosystems and chemical conditions that are relevant for our ecosystems.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, I had a student who was doing an internship at NASA JPL. JPL is Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is one of the NASA centres in Pasadena, California.\n\nAnd she was also taking a graduate course with me, and during that course, she became very interested in doing her master thesis with me.\n\nBut my area of expertise, environmental engineering, environmental science, pollution control, which was not related to what she was doing at her internship.\n\nAt first, it was not even remotely related. She was working on astrobiology-related project and...but she had an interest in both fields.\n\nShe wanted to continue her internship, if possible, work on astrobiology full but she wanted to also work with me.\n\nSo then we decided that it’s best for me and her mentor at JPL to meet and discuss how best we can help her.\n\nAnd once we met, (her mentor was at the time Dr Laurie Barge at NASA JPL), and when I met with Laurie and we discussed the student situation and our own research interests, we realized that this is perfectly doable.\n\nWe have to just decide what are the research projcts that could answer questions from both field, and we had to just do some research to determine what’s the good intersection that we can focus on.\n\nSince then, we’ve been working together. So it’s been about 10 years that we have been working together to create projects that are focused at the intersection of astrobiology and environmental science.\n\nYou know, at California State University, it’s a minority-serving institute, so more than 70% of our students are Hispanic students.\n\nA majority of them are first generation college students.\n\nGraduation and retention is always a big challenge for us. Many of these students, they never had a good mentor. They don’t know how to navigate college life.\n\nThey have imposter syndrome, and you know, they don’t have the cultural capital to help themselves. So mentorship is very critical for them to help them succeed, and to help them grow.\n\nAnd in the context of what I have been doing with NASA, and especially with our first students, I realized how much of a life-changing experience this could be when we give them this opportunity to work with top minds at NASA, when we give them the opportunity to work on interdisciplinary projects, where they have mentors in academia, at their own home school and at JPL, and when we give them all the support that they can have.\n\nThat experience of witnessing the success of our very first few students made us realize that we should come up with the ways to make this more sustainable and secure funding so that we can continue to do what we have been doing informally.\n\nAnd that’s basically gave me and my collaborator, Laurie Barge, at JPL, the idea of creating this pipeline program where we can bring students to JPL to do internship under our supervision. So I can be their mentor at Cal State LA.\n\nLaurie can be their mentor at JPL, and we can basically provide research opportunities to them, funded research opportunities.\n\nBecause most of these students, they have to work. They most of the time work even full time outside the school to support their family, to support themselves.\n\nSo it’s very hard for them to do work on research projects if they are not paid, and they don’t even know that there are research projects that are paid, because, you know, everything is new to them. They are new to this college life. They don’t have the cultural capital to know how they can help themselves, that there are opportunities to work on a research project while they can get enough income that can support them and their family.\n\nOftentimes they can even sometimes make more income compared to the other part-time jobs that they have.\n\nBecause, yes, engineering could be very challenging to many students, but if you can make that exciting by relating that to, you know, NASA mission, or relating that to our universe, how the universe has formed. Or, you know, how is life in other planets? You can make science very exciting to them.\n\nFocusing on the engineering aspect you can also make science very relevant to them. You know, it’s very interesting, because it relates to life on other planets, but also it could help them develop engineering techniques that can improve water quality, remove nitrate pollution from water, so that can be also very, very valuable, because it applies to their community needs, the need for clean water. So if you can make science applicable, relevant and exciting, you capture their attention.\n\nYou know, programs like this are extremely important for the success of the workforce that we need in our current time.\n\nFirst of all, it’s the interdisciplinary project. They get to work with astrobiologists, with planetary scientists, with environmental engineers.\n\nAnd this interdisciplinary approach, in my opinion, makes people very creative, because they learn to, you know, address a problem from different angles.\n\nAnd when you do that kind of a practice, when you try to address a problem from different viewpoint, different angles, it makes you very creative. It’s basically a recipe for creativity, in my opinion.\n\nThis is very important for our society and our student because when you bring diverse talents to the team, when we are giving opportunities to under represented students or underserved students, students that are not normally taking these internship roles at JPL.\n\nWhen we give opportunity to this new group of people, we are bringing diverse talents to the table. And when you have diversity, when you have people with different backgrounds, different viewpoint on your team, your solutions become very diverse.\n\nYou come up with solutions that are having the roots in community needs. So you have community-driven solution to your problems, and that’s the key, because not one every recipe works for every community, for every group, especially when it comes to pollution control and climate change.\n\nI think learning about life on other planet or the conditions that could support life could be very interesting in teaching us how to approach climate change, how to mitigate climate change. When you learn about resource scarcity, when you learn about extreme conditions under which you can still support life, you get more prepared to address climate change or extreme weather conditions as a result of climate change or addressing a scarcity of resources.\n\nSo this is very important for this current time, that we have to learn how to adapt to climate change, we have to learn to mitigate mitigate climate change.\n\nSo the interdisciplinary skill of knowing how astrobiologists search for life on other planets, how life could exist on other planets under extreme conditions, could be very helpful in helping us address climate change.\n\nTake risk. Be comfortable to take more risks and be comfortable with change. And be comfortable to come out of your comfort zone to seek more opportunities, to seek and to take more risks.\n\nAnd be an explorer. Because unless you come out of your comfort zone, unless you go for all of these opportunities that are, you know, maybe having high risk associated with them, you cannot grow.\n\nThe advice that I would give my younger self is to take more risk and be comfortable with it and try to be more resilient.\n\nAnd that’s where the growth comes, and that’s where the opportunity comes. At first, it wasn’t easy. It wasn’t easy for astrobiologists to work with environmental engineering because it’s challenging at first.\n\nYou don’t know much about this other field. It’s new, it’s unknown, but we have grown so much through that experience, because we kind of force ourselves to learn about this other discipline, all these new ways to do science.\n\nAnd even though it was challenging and difficult at the time, but we have learned so much through that experience, and we grow so much.\n\nSo always take more opportunities and be ready to take risks, because it’s going to be very rewarding.\n\nDeborah Daley 17:37\n\nIn the next episode, we meet a US researcher who works tirelessly to bridge the Native American world view with western science.",

      "content": "Growing up in the forests of Chicago, Illinois, and the deserts of Phoenix, Arizona, Jaida Elcock never had much access to the ocean — and was even afraid of sharks. But the more she learnt on TV documentaries, the more she realized that we should be advocating for their conservation. “I really don’t want to know what an ocean without sharks looks like,” she says.\n\nHaving earnt a biology degree at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, and worked her way up through various internships and laboratory technician positions, Elcock is now a graduate student based in Falmouth, Massachusetts, studying the movement ecology of basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus). Along the way, she faced racism, sexism and discrimination, she says.\n\nIn 2020, the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, sparked civil unrest in the United States. On the same day as Floyd’s murder, a white dog walker falsely reported Black birdwatcher Christian Cooper after he asked her to put her dog on a lead. This inspired many Black naturalists, including Elcock, to speak out on social media about their right to exist and occupy outdoor spaces, she says. It also led to the #BlackInNature hashtag, through which Elcock started chatting with fellow shark researchers Amani Webber-Schultz, Jasmin Graham and Carlee Jackson-Bohannon.\n\nPleasantly surprised to realize there were other Black women working in shark science, the four came together and founded Minorities in Shark Sciences (MISS), registered in Bradenton, Florida. Its mission is to advance marine sciences by challenging the status quo of what people think a scientist looks like. MISS works to support under-represented and historically excluded communities to help them to feel confident and accepted in science by providing them with access to a community, knowledge and training opportunities. Five years later, the organization has around 400 members in more than 30 countries.\n\nWhat was it like for you as a young Black shark scientist?\n\nI got a lot of pushback for wanting to become a marine scientist. I was once told that I got my university scholarship because of affirmative action, not because I deserved it. People would say things like “Black people can’t swim. How are you going to work with sharks?”. These ridiculous stereotypes exist because of systemic racism that has led to a generational fear of water in a lot of Black communities, and that is not our fault. (When public swimming pools became popular in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, segregation meant that Black people had less access and so less opportunity to learn to swim.)\n\nI was also told that, as a woman, I wouldn’t be strong enough to handle sharks and I should be in the kitchen or raising a family.\n\nThe Minorities in Shark Science team.Credit: Julia Wester, Field School\n\nFor many people, encountering racism and sexism is incredibly discouraging. Why would you want to start a career in which you might hear those things all the time? But I used this pushback as fuel. If you tell me I can’t do something because of a terrible and irrational reason that’s based in hate, racism and sexism, I’m going to say: ‘Okay, watch me’.\n\nWhen we co-founded MISS, we wanted to create a community of people with shared experiences who would support each other, provide a safe space and create opportunities to help them further their careers. Breaking down the social and financial barriers to getting opportunities in the field of marine science was a key goal.\n\nWe launched on Juneteenth (19 June) 2020. This is a really important day for the Black community in the United States: it’s the day that the last enslaved people received word that they had been freed, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, in which president Abraham Lincoln declared that all slaves in the Confederate states were now considered free. Launching on this day was a way of showing our dedication, support and pride in who we are.\n\nDo you feel like the perception of what a shark scientist looks like is changing?\n\nYes, at least in the spaces I’m in. With MISS, we now have a community of minority scientists that people can contact when they want to highlight certain people in science, whether that’s for a TV show or a school talk.\n\nTV production teams now have somewhere to go to when most shark scientists on their shows are white dudes and they want to highlight the amazing work of other scientists as well. That’s not to say that these white guys aren’t also good at their job, but we want to remind people that there are other scientists out there.\n\nFor younger people, seeing themselves represented is so important, and I think we’re seeing a shift. Young people are now more exposed than before to all these diverse people in science. Seeing someone else who looks like them doing it shows that it could be an option for them, too.\n\nDo you see any parallels between the stereotypes of who can be a shark scientist and which of the 500 or so shark species typically get more attention, such as great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias)?\n\nOn nature shows, you always see the same thing — great whites breaching — and that’s cool. But what about the swell shark (Cephaloscyllium ventriosum), which swallows seawater to prevent itself from getting eaten by predators? What about the pocket shark (Mollisquama parini) that spews bioluminescent goo out of a pocket behind its fins?\n\nThere are parallels with diversity in science, for sure. You often see this one type of scientist — in the same way you see this one type of shark — but there are so many other cool options. We can show appreciation for all these other sharks and shark scientists as well. The more diversity we have in people, the more diversity we’ll get in thought. That’s going to lead to more innovation, more discovery and better science as a whole.\n\nHow does MISS help its members?\n\nWe run webinars and pair people up with mentors to help them apply for funding opportunities, fellowship programmes or graduate school. We also fundraise and apply for grants to support marine scientists from minority groups. We also run collaborative working groups, opportunities such as shark-tagging workshops and our Diversifying Ocean Sciences programme, in which people can learn lab and fieldwork techniques.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn response to growing concerns about women’s safety after dark, several German cities are offering a pragmatic (and much-needed) solution: subsidized night taxi vouchers. Think of it as a modern answer to the age-old dilemma of how to get home safely without breaking the bank or risking a walk through a poorly lit underpass.\n\nThese vouchers, usually worth €10 ($11.84), are proving wildly popular. Cologne’s 1,500 vouchers disappeared within days. Munich more than tripled its supply this year to over 105,000, raising the value from €5 to €10 per ride. For many women, the message is clear: We see the problem, and we’re trying to help.\n\nA rising tide of concern\n\nThe urgency is real. In 2023, Germany recorded a six percent rise in sexual offenses, reaching more than 52,000 reported cases. Surveys show that women are changing how they move through cities. In Hannover, only 28 percent of residents now say they feel safe at night, down from 42 percent in 2018, and women are twice as likely as men to avoid certain public spaces.\n\nIn Mannheim, women cite catcalling, staring, and verbal harassment by groups of men as key reasons for avoiding public areas. It’s not just discomfort; it’s a shift in lifestyle. Many women opt out of public transit altogether or pay out of pocket for what feels safer.\n\nCue the rise of night taxi programs.\n\nHow it works\n\nEach city handles its system a bit differently. Munich requires users to pick up physical vouchers from local offices. Mannheim, however, has gone digital, offering registered users up to 20 online vouchers a year.\n\nEligibility varies: Some cities restrict access to local residents; others open it up to all women over 14 or 16, including trans women. If your ride exceeds €10, you pay the difference. If it’s less? No change, no refund, but at least you’re home safe.\n\nVoucher use is limited to participating taxi companies, which has sparked some complaints. In Freiburg, long wait times prompted officials to expand the number of eligible cab firms.\n\nA hit— with caveats\n\nThe program is a hit with many users. “We’re not going home alone, we’ll take the women’s taxi,” said 18-year-olds June Rothstein and Aletta Höppner, who use Mannheim’s vouchers regularly. But awareness remains patchy. One Mannheim resident, Anne H., said she avoids public transit at night but hadn’t even heard of the program until a reporter told her.\n\nThat lack of visibility is part of the problem, as is the lack of data. Few cities have formally assessed the effectiveness of the taxi voucher programs, making it hard to justify sustained funding. Munich, for example, ran out of money by spring 2025.\n\nEven supporters admit that these vouchers are more of a Band-Aid than a cure.\n\n“The women’s night taxi is a very important measure, but ultimately it is only fighting the side effects of patriarchal conditions,” said Zahra Deilami, Mannheim’s equal opportunity officer.\n\nSafety, for whom?\n\nThe program also risks deepening existing inequalities. For women living farther from city centers, who are often those with lower incomes, even a €10 discount may not be enough. “Women’s safety must not be dependent on income,” said Celeste Eden of the German Women’s Council.\n\nAnd while taxis might offer temporary relief, the larger picture remains bleak. Forty percent of German women over 15 have experienced physical or sexual violence. More broadly, everyday microaggressions like unsolicited comments, invasive stares, or feeling outnumbered in public spaces add up.\n\n“As a woman you don’t feel respected at all,” one Mannheim resident said in a recent survey. “They see you as an object.”\n\nDesigning cities for everyone\n\nSome cities are getting more creative. In Stuttgart, women can request night buses to make unscheduled stops closer to home. Mexico City introduced women-only subway cars. Vienna has long applied gender-sensitive urban planning, redesigning parks and lighting to make them more inclusive.\n\nSociologist Kerstin Sailer of University College London believes cities need to go further. “Cities must normalize the presence of women in public spaces,” she said. That means better design, more people out at night, and a rethinking of who public spaces are really for.\n\nTaxi vouchers, then, are a start. They say: We see the problem. But they can’t be the only solution.\n\n“If the night cab is embedded in a comprehensive catalog of measures, it can certainly be beneficial,” Sailer added. “However, it cannot be the sole measure.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**  \nConcerns about women’s safety at night have been growing in several German cities. Reports show an increase in sexual offenses and a drop in feelings of safety, leading many women to avoid certain public spaces or modes of transportation after dark.\n\n**What happened**  \nIn response, cities like Cologne, Munich, Mannheim, and others introduced subsidized night taxi vouchers. These vouchers, worth around €10, help women afford safe rides home late at night. For example, Cologne’s 1,500 vouchers were claimed within days, and Munich increased its supply to over 105,000 vouchers this year, raising their value from €5 to €10 per ride.\n\n**Impact**  \nThis program offers a practical and affordable way for women to travel safely at night, addressing a real and rising safety concern. It also shows city governments recognizing and responding directly to women’s needs. The vouchers help reduce risks tied to walking alone or using public transit in unsafe conditions.\n\n**What’s next step**  \nCities are refining their systems, with some moving to digital vouchers and expanding eligibility to include all women over a certain age, including trans women. Future steps may involve improving taxi availability and reducing wait times to make the service even more reliable.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**  \nSeveral German cities are making women’s nighttime travel safer and more affordable through targeted night taxi voucher programs.\n",

Les statistiques montrent une augmentation des infractions sexuelles et une baisse du sentiment de sécurité, ce qui pousse de nombreuses femmes à éviter certains espaces publics ou transports la nuit.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé**  \nPour répondre à ce problème, des villes comme Cologne, Munich et Mannheim ont mis en place des bons taxi nocturnes subventionnés. Ces bons, d’une valeur d’environ 10 €, aident les femmes à payer des courses sûres tard le soir. Par exemple, les 1 500 bons de Cologne ont été distribués en quelques jours, et Munich a augmenté son offre à plus de 105 000 bons cette année, doublant leur valeur de 5 € à 10 €.\n\n**Impact**  \nCe programme offre une solution pratique et abordable pour se déplacer en toute sécurité la nuit, répondant directement à des préoccupations réelles.
