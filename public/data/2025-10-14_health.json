      "title": "This new blood test can catch cancer 10 years early",
      "summary": "Scientists at Mass General Brigham have created HPV-DeepSeek, a blood test that can detect HPV-linked head and neck cancers nearly a decade before diagnosis. By finding viral DNA in the bloodstream, the test achieved 99% sensitivity and specificity. This breakthrough could lead to earlier, less invasive treatments and significantly improve survival. A large NIH trial is underway to confirm the results.",
      "content": "Human papilloma virus (HPV) is responsible for about 70% of head and neck cancers in the United States, making it the leading HPV-related cancer and one that continues to rise in frequency each year. Unlike cervical cancer, which can be detected through routine screening, there is currently no test that can identify HPV-associated head and neck cancers before symptoms develop. As a result, most patients are diagnosed only after the tumor has expanded to billions of cells, often spreading to nearby lymph nodes and causing noticeable symptoms. Finding a way to detect these cancers much earlier could allow for prompt treatment and better outcomes.\n\nA new federally funded study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute by researchers at Mass General Brigham introduces a promising advance. The team developed a liquid biopsy test called HPV-DeepSeek, which can identify HPV-linked head and neck cancers up to 10 years before symptoms begin. Detecting the disease this early could increase the chances of successful treatment and reduce the need for aggressive therapies, the researchers report.\n\n\"Our study shows for the first time that we can accurately detect HPV-associated cancers in asymptomatic individuals many years before they are ever diagnosed with cancer,\" said lead study author Daniel L. Faden, MD, FACS, a head and neck surgical oncologist and principal investigator in the Mike Toth Head and Neck Cancer Research Center at Mass Eye and Ear, a member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. \"By the time patients enter our clinics with symptoms from the cancer, they require treatments that cause significant, life-long side effects. We hope tools like HPV-DeepSeek will allow us to catch these cancers at their very earliest stages, which ultimately can improve patient outcomes and quality of life.\"\n\nHPV-DeepSeek works by using whole-genome sequencing to identify trace fragments of HPV DNA that have separated from a tumor and entered the bloodstream. Earlier research from this team showed that the test could reach 99% specificity and 99% sensitivity in detecting cancer during its initial clinical presentation, outperforming all existing diagnostic methods.\n\nTo explore whether HPV-DeepSeek could identify these cancers long before symptoms appear, the researchers analyzed 56 blood samples from the Mass General Brigham Biobank. The samples included 28 from people who later developed HPV-associated head and neck cancer and 28 from healthy individuals who served as controls.\n\nHPV-DeepSeek detected HPV tumor DNA in 22 out of 28 blood samples from patients who later developed the cancer, whereas all 28 control samples tested negative, indicating that the test is highly specific. The test was better able to detect HPV DNA in blood samples that were collected closer to the time of the patients' diagnosis, and the earliest positive result was for a blood sample collected 7.8 years prior to diagnosis.\n\nUsing machine learning, the researchers were able to improve the test's power so that it accurately identified 27 out of 28 cancer cases, including samples collected up to 10 years prior to diagnosis.\n\nThe authors are now validating these findings in a second blinded study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) using hundreds of samples collected as part of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) at the National Cancer Institute.",

      "title": "This experimental “super vaccine” stopped cancer cold in the lab",
      "summary": "UMass Amherst researchers have developed a groundbreaking nanoparticle-based cancer vaccine that prevented melanoma, pancreatic, and triple-negative breast cancers in mice—with up to 88% remaining tumor-free. The vaccine triggers a multi-pathway immune response, producing powerful T-cell activation and long-term immune memory that stops both tumor growth and metastasis. By combining cancer-specific antigens with a lipid nanoparticle “super adjuvant,” it overcomes key challenges in cancer immunotherapy.",
      "content": "Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have shown that their nanoparticle-based vaccine can successfully prevent several aggressive cancers in mice, including melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer. Depending on the cancer type, up to 88% of vaccinated mice stayed tumor-free (depending on the cancer), and the vaccine also reduced -- and in some cases completely prevented -- the spread of cancer throughout the body.\n\n\"By engineering these nanoparticles to activate the immune system via multi-pathway activation that combines with cancer-specific antigens, we can prevent tumor growth with remarkable survival rates,\" says Prabhani Atukorale, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the Riccio College of Engineering at UMass Amherst and corresponding author on the paper.\n\nAtukorale had previously shown that her nanoparticle-based drug design could shrink or eliminate tumors in mice. The new findings reveal that this approach can also prevent cancer from forming in the first place.\n\nIn the first experiment, her team combined the nanoparticle system with well-studied melanoma peptides (called an antigen, similar to how a flu shot typically contains parts of the inactivated flu virus). This formulation activated immune cells known as T cells, training them to detect and destroy melanoma cells. Three weeks later, the vaccinated mice were exposed to melanoma.\n\nEighty percent of the mice that received the \"super adjuvant\" nanoparticle vaccine remained tumor-free and survived the entire study period (250 days). In contrast, all of the mice that received traditional vaccines, non-nanoparticle formulations, or no vaccine at all developed tumors and died within 35 days.\n\nThe vaccine also stopped cancer from spreading to the lungs. When the mice were systemically exposed to melanoma cells to mimic metastasis, none of the nanoparticle-vaccinated mice developed lung tumors, while every other mouse did.\n\n\"Metastases across the board is the highest hurdle for cancer,\" says Atukorale. \"The vast majority of tumor mortality is still due to metastases, and it almost trumps us working in difficult-to-reach cancers, such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer.\"\n\nAtukorale refers to this protection as \"memory immunity.\" \"That is a real advantage of immunotherapy, because memory is not only sustained locally,\" she explains. \"We have memory systemically, which is very important. The immune system spans the entire geography of the body.\"\n\nThe first phase of testing used a vaccine with known antigens designed for melanoma. However, creating antigens for each cancer type can require extensive genome sequencing or bioinformatics analysis. To simplify the process, the researchers tested a second version using killed tumor cells, called tumor lysate, derived directly from the cancer itself. Mice vaccinated with this nanoparticle lysate vaccine were later exposed to melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or triple-negative breast cancer cells.\n\nThe results were impressive: 88% of mice with pancreatic cancer, 75% with breast cancer, and 69% with melanoma rejected tumor formation. Furthermore, all mice that remained tumor-free after vaccination also resisted metastasis when exposed systemically to cancer cells.\n\n\"The tumor-specific T-cell responses that we are able to generate -- that is really the key behind the survival benefit,\" says Griffin Kane, postdoctoral research associate at UMass Amherst and first author on the paper. \"There is really intense immune activation when you treat innate immune cells with this formulation, which triggers these cells to present antigens and prime tumor-killing T cells.\"\n\nThis robust T-cell response is possible because of the particular nanoparticle design of the vaccine.\n\nVaccines -- regardless the target disease -- contain two primary components: The antigen and the adjuvant. The antigen is the piece of the disease-causing pathogen (in this study, cancer cells) that the immune system can be trained to target. The adjuvant is a substance that activates the immune system to recognize the antigen, treat it as a foreign intruder and eliminate it.\n\nThe Atukorale Lab draws inspiration from how pathogens naturally stimulate the immune system. To mount a strong immune response, the body requires multiple \"danger\" signals triggered through different pathways. \"In recent years, we have come to understand how important the selection of the adjuvant is because it drives the second signal that is needed for the correct priming of T and B cells,\" says Atukorale.\n\nHowever, just like oil and water, many of the most promising adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy do not mix well at the molecular level. To overcome this, the Atukorale Lab has engineered a lipid nanoparticle-based \"super adjuvant\" capable of stably encapsulating and co-delivering two distinct immune adjuvants that activate immunity in a coordinated, synergistic way.\n\nThe researchers say that their design offers a platform approach that could be used across multiple cancer types.\n\nThe researchers envision that this platform can be applied to create both therapeutic and preventative regimens, particularly for individuals at high risk for cancer. This is an idea that Atukorale and Kane have turned into a startup called NanoVax Therapeutics.\n\n\"The real core technology that our company has been founded on is this nanoparticle and this treatment approach,\" says Kane. \"This is a platform that Prabhani developed. The startup lets us pursue these translational efforts with the ultimate goal of improving patients' lives.\"\n\nNext, Atukorale and Kane plan to extend this technology to a therapeutic vaccine and have already taken the initial de-risking steps in translation.\n\nAtukorale and Kane credit the Biomedical Engineering department and the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at UMass Amherst, UMass Chan Medical School, and funding from the National Institutes of Health for their support.\n\nThe study was published in the October 9 edition of Cell Reports Medicine.",

      "summary": "A team at Massachusetts General Hospital uncovered that an immune defense protein, Resistin-like molecule gamma, attacks heart cells after a heart attack—literally punching holes in them. This discovery explains why dangerous, fast heart rhythms can strike after an infarction. By removing this molecule in mice, the researchers reduced deadly arrhythmias twelvefold, suggesting that targeting immune-driven damage could open a new path to preventing sudden cardiac death.",
      "content": "Nina Kumowski, MD, of the Department of Radiology and Center for Systems Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital, is the lead author and Matthias Nahrendorf, MD, PhD of the Department of Radiology and Center for Systems Biology at MGH, is the senior author of a paper published in Science, \"Resistin-like molecule γ attacks cardiomyocyte membranes and promotes ventricular tachycardia.\"\n\nQ: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?\n\nIn short: We found that the defense protein \"Resistin like molecule gamma\" (Relmy), produced by neutrophils, punches holes into heart cells after a heart attack. This promotes dangerous, fast, and irregular heart rhythm and cell death in the heart.\n\nThe longer version: The most lethal complications of coronary artery disease are myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac death.\n\nIn MI, the blockage of a heart artery leads to insufficient oxygen supply to heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). This compromises their ability to maintain a stable rhythm and can give rise to a dangerous, unstable heart rhythms (arrhythmia) called ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF).\n\nVT and VF are both serious arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest and death within minutes. In VT, the heart beats very rapidly, but in a coordinated rhythm. In VF, the rhythm is chaotic and uncoordinated.\n\nMost arrhythmias occur within 48 hours after MI and coincide with massive immune cell infiltration into the heart tissue. We were interested in how these immune cells may promote arrhythmia.\n\nWe found neutrophils that get recruited into the infarct (the area of dead tissue resulting from the cutoff of oxygen supply) in large numbers upregulate the gene \"Retnlg,\" coding the protein resistin like molecule gamma (RELMy). We also found a comparable gene, \"RETN,\" in human infarcted heart tissue. When we removed this protein from neutrophils in mice, the arrhythmia burden after MI was reduced 12-fold.\n\nQ: What question were you investigating?\n\nWe were investigating the question of how neutrophils, a specific kind of immune cell, promote ventricular arrhythmia (a dangerous fast irregular heartbeat) after heart attacks. Cardiomyocytes as the main actors in arrhythmia are very well studied, but if and how immune cells can promote arrythmia is less clear. This work is important because ventricular arrhythmia is the most lethal complication after myocardial infarction. We need to understand better what promotes arrythmia to help us develop new antiarrhythmic drugs.\n\nQ: What methods or approach did you use?\n\nWe used a plethora of methods to figure this out. For an initial understanding about which proteins in neutrophils might be important, we used deposited data on gene expression generated by single cell and spatial RNA-sequencing from mice that underwent myocardial infarction. But we also used data from human studies to find similarities in human tissue.\n\nWe also relied on confocal and super-high resolution microscopy in isolated mouse heart muscle cells that were treated with the labeled protein. Further, we deployed in vitro assays such as a liposome model and cell culture techniques to investigate the mouse and the human version of the protein to find out if they work similar.\n\nQ: What did you find?\n\nWe found that after MI in mouse models, neutrophils upregulatethe expression of \"Retnlg,\" the gene coding for RELMy. We also found that the human biological homolog \"RETN,\" the genecoding for Resistin, was higher expressed in human infarcted myocardial tissue compared to non-infarcted tissue, similar to mice.\n\nWe saw that deleting the gene from bone marrow derived cells (such as neutrophils) and deleting the gene from neutrophils specifically significantly reduced incidents of ventricular arrhythmia in the mouse models.\n\nQ: What are the implications?\n\nThe implications are that immune cells play a crucial role in sudden death and arrhythmia.\n\nWe should think about treating both the myocardial infarction both by quick recanalization of the vessel to restore oxygenated blood supply and also by targeting immune cells to mitigate the arrhythmic effects of the injury.\n\nWhen we understand the underlying mechanisms better, we can pursue therapeutic targets that go beyond the broad immune suppression that is used today.\n\nIf we can treat targets more specifically, we can reduce unwanted side effects and unravel the full potential of immune modulation in cardiovascular disease.\n\nQ: What are the next steps?\n\nThe next steps are to find a way to neutralize the harmful protein and test if this can reduce VT burden and infarct size. First in the mouse models, but, we hope, eventually also in humans.\n\nWe should gather more evidence about the significance of this protein in human disease. It is also interesting to see these findings have implications for other diseases with neutrophil recruitment and activation.\n\nAuthorship: In addition to Nina Kumowski and Matthias Nahrendorf, Mass General Brigham authors include Steffen Pabel, Jana Grune, Noor Momin, Kyle I.

      "content": "Nutrition scientists have unlocked an entirely new way of thinking about why certain foods are good for you and others are harmful. Here’s what to eat to function at your best\n\nTomasz Woźniakowski\n\nI am standing in the bathroom with a strip of litmus paper in my hand. I am going to pee on it and hope that it doesn’t turn red, which would indicate acid. This isn’t for a bet – it is a (ahem) litmus test of whether my diet is slowly killing me. Acidic urine is a crude sign that something called my dietary acid load is too high. If it is, I am opening myself up to a range of ills. Luckily, there is a simple cure: a change of diet. So, if I do see red, I am going to eat some spinach and try again.\n\nThis might sound like medical woo-woo, and there are worrying echoes of a discredited fad called the alkaline diet. But nutrition scientists increasingly think that by ignoring dietary acid load we are missing a trick when it comes to healthy eating. “The higher the dietary acid load, the higher the risk of developing chronic diseases,” says Hana Kahleova at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a not-for-profit research centre in Washington DC. These include kidney disease, liver disease, cancer, obesity, hypertension and even anxiety and depression.\n\nShockingly, almost all of us are getting this wrong – especially if we eat a regular Western diet. But the good news is that, unlike the damage caused by consuming too much salt or more calories than we need, this can be quite easily reversed, provided you know which foods and drinks make your body too acidic. What’s more, the new science of dietary acid load is throwing fresh light on why certain diets promote chronic diseases.\n\nThe idea that the food we eat affects the acid-alkaline balance of our bodies was established in the 1960s when doctors discovered that, although human urine is usually acidic, the pee of vegetarians tends to be slightly alkaline. This was later shown to be correlated with the amount of “acid ash” in people’s diets. A now-obsolete measure, the acid-ash test entails incinerating foodstuffs and analysing the resulting ash, a process that supposedly mimics metabolism and indicates whether the final breakdown products of digested foods are acidic or alkaline.\n\nWhen it comes to dietary acid, the worst part of this unhealthy feast is the burger\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Health Check Expert insight and news on scientific developments in health, nutrition and fitness, every Saturday. Sign up to newsletter\n\nIn 1968, two doctors at Harvard University proposed that too much dietary ash was the cause of two major diseases of old age, osteoporosis, or bone loss, and sarcopenia, or muscle wasting. Their hypothesis was that to buffer the effect of excess acid, bones and muscles are broken down to release alkaline compounds such as carbonates, phosphates and ammonia. The result, they proposed, is a reduction in bone density and muscle mass. The acid-ash hypothesis has long fallen out of favour, largely because there is no evidence that an acidic diet is a risk factor for osteoporosis. However, the basic idea lives on in the form of dietary acid load – a phoenix from the flames.\n\nMeasuring acidity is Chemistry 101. You probably remember using litmus paper in a school science lab to assess the pH of various substances on a scale from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral, anything below being acidic, and anything above being alkaline. As with my pee test, the paper will turn red to indicate acid and blue for alkali. A more sophisticated version of this test reveals that the pH of human blood and the intracellular fluids derived from it is kept on a tight leash – ideally within the range of 7.35 to 7.45, so slightly alkaline.\n\n“Our body needs to keep the pH very constant,” says Kahleova. Stray outside this and things go quickly downhill, especially if it drops below the lower limit. This is a state called acute metabolic acidosis, which manifests as a rapid heartbeat, confusion, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, headaches and, in extreme cases, death. Nasty, but rare. Normally, our bodies have little difficulty staying on their pH leash. Most cases of acute acidosis are caused by underlying conditions such as kidney and liver disease, cancer and diabetes, although it is not unknown in people eating an extremely high-protein diet, exercising to exhaustion, suffering from acute diarrhoea or overdosing on laxatives.\n\nWhat makes me acidic?\n\nThe two main sources of acid in the bloodstream are respiration, which generates carbon dioxide (which becomes carbonic acid when dissolved in water) and the digestion and metabolism of food and drink, which produces many other acidic compounds. The lungs deal with the former and the kidneys the latter. Carbon dioxide doesn’t cause acidosis, because the lungs easily excrete it. But, depending on your diet, acids derived from things you consume can: the overall balance as a result of food and drink is referred to as the dietary acid load, or DAL.\n\nTo maintain its preferred mildly alkaline state, our body must excrete the same amount of acid as it gains. When acid predominates, the kidneys filter out the excess and dump it into the urine. If more must be done to get back on track, they also retrieve alkaline bicarbonate ions from the filtrate and return these to the bloodstream. For most people, most of the time, this system is perfectly capable of keeping their body in the Goldilocks zone. Unfortunately, staying out of acute metabolic acidosis isn’t enough, though. Even hovering on or around the lower pH limit of 7.35 can cause problems, pushing us into a state called low-grade metabolic acidosis, which, despite not being as dangerous as acute acidosis, is still a health risk.\n\nSurprisingly, acidic citrus fruits, such as oranges, are alkaline when your body digests them\n\nWhat determines whether a food is acidic isn’t its pH when it is on your plate, but the pH of its metabolites. The final breakdown products of what we eat and drink range enormously in pH, from quite acidic through to quite alkaline. They can be surprising. Many relatively acidic foods, such as citrus fruits, are actually alkaline in the context of DAL because the abundant citric acid they contain is metabolised to bicarbonate, which is alkaline. They, and other fruits and vegetables, are also rich in proteins that produce alkaline metabolites. This is in sharp contrast to animal proteins. They are rich in the sulphur-containing amino acids cysteine, homocysteine and methionine, plus three other amino acids, namely lysine, arginine and histidine, all of which lead to acidic metabolites. Many grains and nuts contain these acid-generating amino acids too. Indeed, proteins are the main determinant of DAL. Other notable sources of acid in our diets are the chloride ions in table salt (sodium chloride) and the food additive phosphoric acid, which is put into fizzy drinks and a wide variety of processed fare such as meats, dairy products and cereal bars.\n\nMore perils of a Western diet\n\nAt this point, alarm bells may be ringing. Western-style diets are notoriously rich in animal products, salt, refined grains and ultra-processed foods, and low in fruit and vegetables – the perfect recipe for low-grade metabolic acidosis. Indeed, researchers believe that among people consuming the typical Western diet, it is very common, if not ubiquitous. “We have a chronic exposure to a high dietary acid load, so that’s something that we all have,” says Ilias Attaye at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nBut addressing this isn’t as straightforward as simply switching away from a Western diet – there are many factors to take into account. One is that some fresh fruits and vegetables contain compounds that are metabolised to oxalic acid, which pushes them towards the acidic column. This makes things like beets, blackberries, cherries, grapes and raspberries much less alkaline than you might hope, according to Gabriela Leal-Escobar at the Ignacio Chávez National Institute of Cardiology in Mexico City. Many plant-based processed foods, meanwhile, include acid-forming additives such as phosphoric acid. “You have to be very careful about additives, make sure vegetables don’t have anything added to them, because that can really promote the acid load,” says Attaye.\n\nCounterintuitively, inside your body, some of these fruits produce acidic metabolites\n\nAnother problem is that assessing DAL is notoriously difficult. The pH of your urine is too crude a measure to be of clinical use. There is no gold standard measure for DAL, but there is a method to calculate it more accurately. Potential renal acid load, or PRAL, was developed in the early 1990s to replace the acid-ash test. It is calculated with an equation that estimates the amount of acid or alkali that will be produced when 100 grams of a given foodstuff or drink are metabolised, measured in a unit called milliequivalents per litre (mEq/L). The outcome is a number ranging from about minus 15 to around plus 35. In contrast with the pH scale, however, the more negative the PRAL score, the more alkaline the food; the more positive, the more acidic. In this case, 0 is neutral.\n\nPRAL is calculated from the content of just five nutrients: total protein, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Protein and phosphorus add to the score, while calcium, magnesium and potassium subtract from it. That may seem plain wrong, as proteins are the major determinant of DAL and can be acid or alkali-producing. But this is compensated for by the fact that animal products contain more phosphorus than plant products do, which, in turn, are richer in calcium, magnesium and potassium, says Kahleova. “So, if you’re consuming more animal protein, automatically your dietary acid load will be higher.”\n\nIn general, the mEq/L of an animal-derived food is acidic and plant products are alkaline. “Meat’s dietary acid load is roughly between 8 and 10. Cheese is even more acidic, at around 30 – Parmesan being the highest at 34,” says Kahleova. “Rye bread is about 4 – still slightly acidic. Legumes tend to be around 0 or slightly negative, and most vegetables and fruits are in the negative numbers, like minus 4 or 5. The champion is the leafy greens, at minus 14. So leafy greens are the most effective way to make your diet more alkaline.” Alcoholic drinks, meanwhile, are effectively neutral. Wine has a PRAL score of +0.03 per 100 ml, spirits +0.11 and beer -0.2.\n\nPRAL can be adjusted to take account of people’s height and weight, but it isn’t a perfect measure. A major weakness is that it doesn’t include salt, so it probably underestimates the true DAL. However, the assumption is that the chloride ions that salt produces are mostly consumed in processed foods, many of which have PRAL scores that take account of salt. Also, since people on Western diets tend to eat roughly the same amount of salt, it has a similar impact on everyone and so can be ignored. Nevertheless, for everyday purposes, PRAL can give a pretty good sense of whether your diet has an acidic or alkaline outcome, and to what extent – and hence offer guidance about healthier eating.\n\nLeafy green vegetables are the best option when it comes to reducing the pH in your body\n\nIf you are interested in the acidity question, you don’t have to calculate PRAL from scratch. There are tables available containing the scores of hundreds of common foodstuffs, so all you need to do is make a note of what you ate and how much, then tally your PRAL score per day, which is expressed in units of mEq/d. If the number that pops out is below 60, you are almost certainly fine. An overall negative score – unlikely, given the Western diet is overwhelmingly acidic – is also nothing to worry about. Although there is an alkaline version of acidosis, called alkalosis, there are no known cases of it being caused by an excessively alkaline diet, according to Kahleova. However, if your score is over 60 mEq/d, that is a problem.\n\nI did this for a few days – not easy, as the tables only feature raw ingredients – and found that my PRAL figure was consistently around 70 mEq/d. That is on the low side of what is typical for somebody eating a Western-style diet. But then, I am vegetarian – albeit one with a passion for cheese. My score still isn’t good, though. Attaye notes that healthy kidneys can eliminate between about 40 and 60mEq of acid per day without any trouble. Admittedly, they can deal with a lot more, but that takes a toll. “They will always find a way to keep the pH where it’s supposed to be. But it places a huge demand on them,” says Kahleova. Overloaded kidneys work hard to raise the pH above the lower threshold – but only just. The result is low-grade metabolic acidosis, and its attendant health problems.\n\nThe first organ system to feel the burn is the kidneys themselves. Persistent overwork gradually grinds them down, leading to mild chronic kidney disease. This then starts a vicious cycle, says Attaye. Diseased kidneys are less efficient at eliminating excess acid, so have to work ever harder to maintain a healthy pH. Eventually, they can’t keep up and low-grade metabolic acidosis can develop into full-blown acidosis. People with kidney disease are already often advised to eat a low-PRAL diet. But it is probably better for your kidneys to take action before the problems start. “The lighter we can make their work, the better for us,” says Kahleova.\n\nHow acid corrodes you\n\nThe link between a high DAL and kidney disease is pretty much nailed down. Now, there is a growing suspicion among nutrition scientists that the acid inside our bodies eats deeper. Low-grade metabolic acidosis has been tentatively linked to multiple chronic conditions, including diabetes, obesity, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, anxiety and depression. As yet, these are just associations from small-scale studies. Bigger ones are needed before DAL can be built into dietary guidelines, says Attaye. But they are coming. For example, he has just received funding for a clinical trial to look at how low and high-acid diets affect the metabolic health of people with diabetes.\n\nThe link with obesity is quite robust too. Kahleova recently completed a trial in which overweight adults followed either a Mediterranean-style diet or a low-fat vegan diet for 16 weeks, then swapped over. Participants could eat as much as they wanted as long as they didn’t eat the wrong things. The Mediterranean diet had a negligible impact on weight loss, but when on the vegan diet, participants lost an average of 6 kilograms of body fat. That was mainly because they consumed fewer calories – but this only accounted for about three-quarters of the weight loss. Kahleova believes DAL accounts for the rest. She measured the acidity of the diets using PRAL, with an adjustment for weight and height, and found that, although both were alkaline, the vegan one was much more so: its PRAL score was around -19.3 mEq/d, compared with -1.6 mEq/d for the Mediterranean diet. “The alkaline environment basically enables metabolic processes to run more efficiently,” she says. “The vegan diet increases metabolism, so after each meal the body just burns more calories.”\n\nOther conditions that have been linked to high DAL need further testing. Nevertheless, Attaye sees a plausible mechanism by which an excessively acidic diet might lead to chronic diseases. “The fundamental studies are lacking, so we don’t really understand what’s going on,” he says. “But my thought is that it contributes to low-grade inflammation.” Overloading the kidneys causes the release of the stress hormone cortisol, which leads to inflammation. And chronic inflammation is a known risk factor for multiple conditions.\n\nBeer and wine aren’t acidic when digested, so you can enjoy a tipple if you like. Cheers!\n\nGiven the known and suspected consequences of a high-acid diet, perhaps it is no surprise that it also increases the risk of premature death. Earlier this year, a team led by Mohammad Reza Pashaei at Urmia University of Medical Sciences in Iran published a review of the literature on DAL. The researchers found that each increase of 10 mEq/d raises the risk of dying from any cause by 3 per cent.\n\nAll of this is pointing to a way of eating healthily that both Attaye and Kahleova believe will become as influential and well-known as the Mediterranean diet: the low-acid diet. To be clear, it isn’t the same as the fad alkaline diet, which rests on the unscientific assumption that too much acid causes cancer and that an alkaline diet can prevent and cure it. This has been debunked repeatedly. In 2018, the British Dietetic Association went so far as to declare it as “nonsense”.\n\nA scientifically sound low-acid diet wouldn’t be radically different from existing healthy eating guidelines. A focus on DAL strongly backs the message that cutting down on animal products, salt, refined grains and ultra-processed foods is good for you – as is eating more fruit and vegetables. “It reinforces the more general concept of eating less animal protein, less processed foods and more leafy greens,” says Attaye. “But there are some nuances. It’s not completely the same because also some vegetables and grains have a high acid load.”\n\nWe have long understood that what we eat can contribute to chronic diseases. Our emerging understanding of DAL is bringing new insights into how these two things are linked. “The field of nutrition is working towards a more holistic view of food. DAL, I think, is one of the ways to look at it. It’s not the only way, but it’s one of the ways,” says Attaye.\n\nBetter yet, there is an immediate win we can all take from this. The damage we do to ourselves by consuming too much acid-forming food and drink can quite easily be reversed by choosing alkali-forming alternatives. I can attest to this. My urine test did come up red, but after eating a bag of spinach, I tried again and this time the litmus paper was blue.\n\n“This is something we can influence through dietary choices,” says Kahleova. “It’s a simple, simple intervention that everybody can do.”",
