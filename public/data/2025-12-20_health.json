      "summary": "In a rare and historic achievement, Children’s Hospital Colorado successfully completed its first dual heart and liver transplant in a pediatric patient. The life-saving surgery was performed on 11-year-old Gracie Greenlaw, whose congenital heart condition eventually led to liver failure. Dozens of specialists worked together for years to prepare for a moment like this, executing a complex, 16-hour operation. Now months later, Gracie is home, in school, and thriving.",
      "content": "Children's Hospital Colorado (Children's Colorado) has completed its first-ever dual heart and liver transplant, marking a major milestone for the hospital. The complex procedure involved dozens of specialists working across 25 multidisciplinary care teams. Nationwide, only 38 pediatric patients have previously received both a heart and liver transplant.\n\n\"Performing Children's Colorado's first-ever heart and liver dual organ transplant is an amazing accomplishment for our Pediatric Transplant Program,\" said Dr. Megan Adams, surgical director of the Pediatric Liver Transplant and Kidney Transplant Programs. \"Thanks to years of dedication and a team committed to being the trusted leaders in pediatric transplant across our seven-state region, we're grateful to provide this level of care to even more kids who need complex organ transplants to treat life-threatening illnesses and help them live healthy and happy lives.\"\n\nYears of Preparation Lead to a Life-Saving Moment\n\nCare teams at Children's Colorado had spent years preparing for the possibility of a dual heart and liver transplant. Close coordination among specialists in surgery, cardiology, hepatology, and other fields, along with strong backing from hospital leadership, ensured the team was ready when 11-year-old Gracie Greenlaw and her family needed help.\n\nGracie was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a condition in which her heart developed with only one functioning pumping chamber. Before turning three, she underwent three major surgeries, the Norwood, the Glenn and the Fontan, to allow her heart to circulate blood effectively. Although many children with HLHS now survive into adulthood, the condition and its treatments can lead to serious long-term complications, including liver damage and liver failure.\n\nManaging the Long-Term Effects of Congenital Heart Disease\n\nTo address these ongoing challenges, Children's Colorado established the Fontan Multidisciplinary Clinic in 2016 as part of its Single Ventricle Program. The clinic focuses on caring for patients with HLHS and other single ventricle conditions, such as tricuspid atresia and unbalanced common atrioventricular canal, by providing coordinated, whole-patient care.\n\nThrough this program, Gracie received continuous monitoring and treatment for both her heart and liver. Her care team included experts like cardiologist Dr. Kathleen Simpson and hepatologist Dr. Dania Brigham, who worked together to manage her condition until a transplant became the best option.\n\n\"The Fontan is a lifesaving surgery, but the longer someone lives after the procedure, there is an increased chance of developing comorbidities,\" Simpson said. \"Our care team worked to keep her healthy and living a typical day-to-day life as long as possible before we determined a dual organ transplant would give her the best long-term quality of life.\"\n\nPreparing for a Complex Dual Organ Transplant\n\nFor years, Gracie lived with plastic bronchitis, a condition that causes thick, protein-like material to build up in the airways. Over the past year, her symptoms worsened, and signs of liver failure began to appear. Her medical team concluded that moving forward with a dual transplant was necessary, and she was placed on the transplant waitlist in April.\n\nIn preparation, dozens of specialists met regularly to plan for the surgery. They carefully accounted for the challenges of transplanting two organs at once, including differences in blood volume needs and electrolyte management during the operation.\n\nA Carefully Orchestrated 16-Hour Surgery\n\nLess than a month after joining the waitlist, compatible donor organs became available, made possible by another family's decision to donate. Because the heart can only remain viable for a short time, the surgical team began with the heart transplant. Dr. Matthew Stone, surgical director of the Pediatric Heart Transplant Program, and congenital heart surgeon Dr. Emily Downs led the nine-hour procedure.\n\nWhile the heart surgery was underway, the donor liver was maintained on a TransMedics Organ Care System -- a specialized device designed to replicate normal liver function. This technology preserved the liver and allowed the heart surgeons the time they needed to complete their work. Dr. Adams and transplant surgeon Dr. Kendra Conzen then performed the liver transplant, which took an additional seven hours. Throughout the process, close coordination with anesthesiology teams was essential to protect Gracie's health.\n\nRecovery and a Return to Everyday Life\n\nThe surgery was successful. Gracie left the cardiac progress care unit just over a month later. Seven months after the transplant, she continues to attend monthly follow-up visits, but she has returned to school and is back home with her dogs.\n\nLike other pediatric heart transplant recipients, Gracie will need another heart transplant later in life. Her transplanted liver, however, is expected to last for the rest of her lifetime.\n\n\"This procedure showcases the expertise, talent and level of care Children's Colorado provides to our patients, including those with complex medical needs,\" said Dr. Duncan Wilcox, Surgeon in Chief. \"As the top-ranked pediatric hospital in Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region, we are proud of our leading-edge transplant care and look forward to supporting more patients who need dual organ transplants in the future.\"",

      "title": "The 98% mystery: Scientists just cracked the code on “junk DNA” linked to Alzheimer’s",
      "summary": "Researchers have revealed that so-called “junk DNA” contains powerful switches that help control brain cells linked to Alzheimer’s disease. By experimentally testing nearly 1,000 DNA switches in human astrocytes, scientists identified around 150 that truly influence gene activity—many tied to known Alzheimer’s risk genes. The findings help explain why many disease-linked genetic changes sit outside genes themselves. The resulting dataset is now being used to train AI systems to predict gene control more accurately.",
      "content": "When people picture DNA, they often imagine a set of genes that shape our physical traits, influence behavior, and help keep our cells and organs functioning.\n\nBut genes make up only a small slice of our genetic code. Just around 2% of DNA contains our 20,000-odd genes. The other 98% has long been labelled the non-coding genome, or so-called 'junk' DNA. This larger portion includes many of the control switches that determine when genes turn on and how strongly they act.\n\nAstrocytes and hidden DNA switches in the brain\n\nResearchers from UNSW Sydney have now pinpointed DNA switches that help regulate astrocytes. Astrocytes are brain cells that support neurons, and they are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn research published on December 18 in Nature Neuroscience, a team from UNSW's School of Biotechnology & Biomolecular Sciences reported that they tested nearly 1000 possible switches in lab-grown human astrocytes. These switches are strings of DNA called enhancers. Enhancers can sit far from the genes they influence, sometimes separated by hundreds of thousands of DNA letters, which makes them difficult to investigate.\n\nTesting nearly 1000 enhancers at once\n\nTo tackle that problem, the researchers combined CRISPRi with single-cell RNA sequencing. CRISPRi is a method that can switch off small stretches of DNA without cutting it. Single-cell RNA sequencing measures gene activity in individual cells. Together, the tools let the team examine the effects of nearly 1000 enhancers in a single large-scale test.\n\n\"We used CRISPRi to turn off potential enhancers in the astrocytes to see whether it changed gene expression,\" says lead author Dr. Nicole Green.\n\n\"And if it did, then we knew we'd found a functional enhancer and could then figure out which gene -- or genes -- it controls. That's what happened for about 150 of the potential enhancers we tested. And strikingly, a large fraction of these functional enhancers controlled genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nCutting the list from 1000 candidates to about 150 confirmed switches greatly reduces the search area in the non-coding genome for genetic clues linked to Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"These findings suggest that similar studies in other brain cell types are needed to highlight the functional enhancers in the vast space of non-coding DNA\"\n\nWhy \"in-between\" DNA matters for many diseases\n\nProfessor Irina Voineagu, who oversaw the study, says the results also provide a useful reference for interpreting other genetic research. The team's findings create a catalogue of DNA regions that can help explain results from studies looking for disease-related genetic changes.\n\n\"When researchers look for genetic changes that explain diseases like hypertension, diabetes and also psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease -- we often end up with changes not within genes so much, but in-between,\" she says.\n\nHer team directly tested those \"in-between\" stretches in human astrocytes and showed which enhancers truly control key brain genes.\n\n\"We're not talking about therapies yet. But you can't develop them unless you first understand the wiring diagram. That's what this gives us -- a deeper view into the circuitry of gene control in astrocytes.\"\n\nFrom gene switches to AI prediction models\n\nRunning nearly a thousand enhancer tests in the lab took painstaking effort. The researchers say this is the first time a CRISPRi enhancer screen of this size has been carried out in brain cells. Now that the groundwork has been done, the dataset can also be used to train computer models to predict which suspected enhancers are real gene switches, potentially saving years of lab work.\n\n\"This dataset can help computational biologists test how good their prediction models are at predicting enhancer function,\" says Prof. Voineagu.\n\nShe adds that Google's DeepMind team is already using the dataset to benchmark their recent deep learning model called AlphaGenome.\n\nPotential tools for gene therapy and precision medicine\n\nBecause many enhancers are active only in specific cell types, targeting them could offer a way to fine-tune gene expression in astrocytes without changing neurons or other brain cells.\n\n\"While this is not close to being used in the clinic yet -- and much work remains before these findings could lead to treatments -- there is a clear precedent,\" Prof. Voineagu says.\n\n\"The first gene editing drug approved for a blood disease -- sickle cell anemia -- targets a cell-type specific enhancer.\"\n\nDr. Green says enhancer research could become an important part of precision medicine.\n\n\"This is something we want to look at more deeply: finding out which enhancers we can use to turn genes on or off in a single brain cell type, and in a very controlled way,\" she says.",

      "summary": "A small tweak to mitochondrial energy production led to big gains in health and longevity. Mice engineered to boost a protein that helps mitochondria work more efficiently lived longer and showed better metabolism, stronger muscles, and healthier fat tissue. Their cells produced more energy while dialing down oxidative stress and inflammation tied to aging. The results hint that improving cellular power output could help slow the aging process itself.",
      "content": "People around the world are living longer than ever, and that shift is changing what many want from aging. The goal is no longer just more years, but more good years. That has put new attention on \"healthspan,\" the stretch of life when someone remains energetic, independent, and generally free of serious age-related problems.\n\nA major focus of this effort is the mitochondria, often called the powerhouse of the cell. These structures generate the energy that keeps cells running by producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Because aging and many age-related diseases are closely tied to declining mitochondrial function, scientists see mitochondria as an important target for research aimed at healthier longevity.\n\nMitochondrial supercomplexes and the energy pipeline\n\nInside mitochondria, energy production depends on respiratory chain complexes. These molecules move protons and electrons in ways that ultimately allow cells to make ATP. Researchers have known for years that these complexes can assemble into larger, flexible groupings called supercomplexes. These supercomplexes are thought to improve the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration.\n\nEven so, solid evidence that directly connects supercomplexes to clear health benefits has been limited, especially from studies in animals. That gap has left an important question unresolved: do these structures actually make a measurable difference for aging and overall health?\n\nThe COX7RP protein under the microscope\n\nTo explore this, a team led by Team Leader Satoshi Inouefrom the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology in Japan examined COX7RP, a mitochondrial protein that helps supercomplexes form. Their new study, co-authored by Dr. Kazuhiro Ikeda from Saitama Medical University in Japan, appeared in the journal Aging Cell.\n\n\"We previously identified COX7RP, a mitochondrial protein, as a key factor that promotes the formation of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, thereby enhancing energy production and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress in cells,\" explains Dr. Inoue. \"Based on this, we investigated the role of COX7RP and mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes in regulating aging and anti-aging processes.\"\n\nEngineered mice lived longer and stayed healthier\n\nThe researchers created COX7RP-transgenic (COX7RP-Tg) mice that were designed to produce higher levels of COX7RP throughout their lives. With this model, the team could closely track how the protein affected lifespan, aging-related changes, and metabolism.\n\nThe results were striking. On average, the COX7RP-Tg mice lived 6.6% longer than wild-type mice. The benefits were not limited to lifespan alone, since the engineered mice also showed signs of better healthspan. They had improved glucose homeostasis due to greater insulin sensitivity, as well as improved lipid measures with lower blood triglycerides and total cholesterol. The team also found better muscle endurance and less fat buildup in the liver.\n\nStronger mitochondria and fewer aging signals\n\nAt the cellular level, the data pointed to a clear improvement in mitochondrial performance. In tissues from COX7RP-Tg mice, the formation of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes increased, and ATP production rose as well.\n\nA closer look at white adipose tissue revealed shifts in multiple aging-related biomarkers. The mice showed higher levels of coenzyme NAD+, lower levels of ROS, and reduced levels of the cellular aging marker β-galactosidase. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing on white adipose tissue from older mice, the researchers also found reduced activity in genes associated with age-related inflammation. This included genes tied to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a prototypic characteristic of senescent cells.\n\nWhy this could matter for healthy aging\n\nTaken together, the findings suggest that making mitochondria more energy efficient may help delay or reduce common problems linked to aging. \"Our study elucidated novel mitochondrial mechanisms underlying anti-aging and longevity, and provided new insights into strategies for promoting healthspan and extending lifespan,\" highlights Dr. Inoue. \"For instance, supplements and medications that enhance the assembly and function of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes may contribute to longevity expansion.\"\n\nThe researchers say additional work could strengthen the case for mitochondrial supercomplexes as treatment targets. If confirmed, this line of research could support new approaches to preserving vitality and addressing age-related metabolic disorders including diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity.\n\nThis work was supported by grants of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (23K07996, 24K02505, 22K06929, 23H02962, 24K21297); the Integrated Research Initiative for Living Well with Dementia at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology; the Takeda Science Foundation; and the Vehicle Racing Commemorative Foundation.

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Los científicos buscan formas de ayudar a las personas a vivir con mejor salud a medida que envejecen. Se centran en las mitocondrias, pequeñas partes dentro de las células que producen energía. Cuando funcionan mejor, las células se mantienen más saludables, lo que podría ralentizar el envejecimiento.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigadores en Japón aumentaron una proteína llamada COX7RP en ratones. Esta proteína ayuda a las mitocondrias a trabajar mejor formando estructuras llamadas supercomplejos. Los ratones modificados vivieron aproximadamente un 6,6 % más y mostraron mejor salud, como músculos más fuertes, mejor control del azúcar en sangre y menos grasa en el hígado.\n\n**Impacto** – Este estudio demuestra que mejorar la producción de energía en las mitocondrias puede ayudar a los animales a vivir más tiempo y con mejor salud. También redujo señales de envejecimiento en las células, como moléculas dañinas e inflamación. Esto es importante porque conecta una proteína específica con beneficios reales para la salud en el envejecimiento.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos quieren investigar si aumentar COX7RP o proteínas similares puede ayudar a los humanos a mantenerse saludables al envejecer. También planean probar si suplementos o medicamentos pueden mejorar la función mitocondrial para combatir problemas relacionados con la edad como la diabetes y la obesidad.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Aumentar una proteína que ayuda a las mitocondrias a producir energía puede extender la vida y mejorar la salud en ratones, ofreciendo nuevas pistas para frenar el envejecimiento a nivel celular.",

      "summary": "A new bioluminescent tool allows neurons to glow on their own, letting scientists track brain activity without harmful lasers or fading signals. The advance makes it possible to watch individual brain cells fire for hours, offering a clearer, deeper look at how the brain works.",
      "content": "About ten years ago, researchers began exploring a bold idea: using bioluminescent light to see what the brain is doing in real time. Instead of shining light onto brain tissue from the outside, they wondered whether neurons could be made to glow on their own.\n\n\"We started thinking: 'What if we could light up the brain from the inside?'\" said Christopher Moore, a professor of brain science at Brown University. \"Shining light on the brain is used to measure activity -- usually through a process called fluorescence -- or to drive activity in cells to test what role they play. But shooting lasers at the brain has down sides when it comes to experiments, often requiring fancy hardware and a lower rate of success. We figured we could use bioluminescence instead.\"\n\nBuilding the Bioluminescence Hub\n\nThat idea helped launch the Bioluminescence Hub at Brown University's Carney Institute for Brain Science in 2017. Supported by a major grant from the National Science Foundation, the hub brought together collaborators including Moore (associate director of the Carney Institute), Diane Lipscombe (the institute's director), Ute Hochgeschwender (at Central Michigan University), and Nathan Shaner (at the University of California San Diego).\n\nThe team set out to create and share new neuroscience tools by giving cells in the nervous system the ability to produce light and respond to it.\n\nA New Tool for Watching Neurons Glow\n\nIn a study published in Nature Methods, the researchers described a new bioluminescent imaging tool they developed. Known as the Ca2+ BioLuminescence Activity Monitor -- or \"CaBLAM,\" for short -- the tool can capture activity within individual cells and even smaller cellular regions at high speed. It works effectively in mice and zebrafish, supports recordings that last for hours, and does not require any external light source.\n\nMoore said Shaner, an associate professor of neuroscience and pharmacology at U.C. San Diego, led the effort to design the molecular device behind CaBLAM. \"CaBLAM is a really amazing molecule that Nathan created,\" Moore said. \"It lives up to its name.\"\n\nWhy Measuring Brain Activity Matters\n\nTracking the activity of living brain cells is critical for understanding how organisms function, Moore explained. Today, the most common way to do this relies on fluorescence-based genetically encoded calcium-ion indicators.\n\n\"In the way fluorescence works, you shine light beams at something, and you get a different wavelength of light beams back,\" said Moore, who directs the Bioluminescence Hub. \"You can make that process calcium-sensitive so you can get proteins that will shift back a different amount or different color of light, depending on whether or not calcium is present, with a bright signal.\"\n\nAlthough fluorescence techniques are widely used, Moore said they come with major drawbacks. Prolonged exposure to intense external light can harm brain cells. Over time, that illumination can also alter the fluorescent molecules themselves so they no longer emit enough light, a problem known as photobleaching that limits how long experiments can run. In addition, delivering light to the brain requires equipment like lasers and optical fibers, which makes experiments more invasive.\n\nWhy Bioluminescence Offers Clear Advantages\n\nBioluminescent imaging works differently. Light is generated when an enzyme breaks down a specific small molecule, meaning no bright external light is needed. As a result, there is no photobleaching and no phototoxic damage, making the approach safer for delicate brain tissue.\n\nIt also produces cleaner images.\n\n\"Brain tissue already glows faintly on its own when hit by external light, creating background noise,\" Shaner said. \"On top of that, brain tissue scatters light, blurring both the light going in and the signal coming back out. This makes images dimmer, fuzzier, and harder to see deep inside the brain. The brain does not naturally produce bioluminescence, so when engineered neurons glow on their own, they stand out against a dark background with almost no interference. And with bioluminescence, the brain cells act like their own headlights: You only have to watch the light coming out, which is much easier to see even when scattered through tissue.\"\n\nMoore noted that scientists have discussed using bioluminescence to study brain activity for decades, but until now, no one had succeeded in making the light bright enough for detailed imaging.\n\nThe Insights That Made CaBLAM Possible\n\n\"The current paper is exciting for a lot of reasons,\" Moore said. \"These new molecules have provided, for the first time, the ability to see single cells independently activated, almost as if you're using a very special, sensitive movie camera to record brain activity while it's happening.\"\n\nUsing CaBLAM, researchers can observe how a single neuron behaves inside a living animal, including activity within different parts of the cell. In the study, the team reported a continuous five-hour recording session, something that would not be possible with traditional fluorescence-based methods.\n\n\"For studying complex behavior or learning, bioluminescence allows one to capture the entire process, with less hardware involved,\" Moore said.\n\nBeyond Imaging the Brain\n\nThe CaBLAM project is part of a larger effort at the hub to invent new ways to observe and control brain activity. One experiment involves a living cell sending out a flash of light that a nearby cell can detect, allowing neurons to communicate using light itself (what Moore calls, \"rewiring the brain with light\"). The team is also developing techniques that use calcium to regulate cellular activity.\n\nAs these projects evolved, the researchers realized they all depended on having brighter and more effective calcium sensors. That need has become a central focus of the hub's work, Moore said.\n\n\"We made sure that as a center that's trying to push the field forward, we created the necessary component pieces,\" Moore said.\n\nA Tool With Broader Potential\n\nMoore believes CaBLAM could eventually be applied beyond neuroscience to study activity in other parts of the body.\n\n\"This advance allows a whole new range of options for seeing how the brain and body work,\" Moore said, \"including tracking activity in multiple parts of the body at once.\"\n\nHe added that the achievement highlights the strength of collaborative research. At least 34 scientists contributed to the project, representing Bioluminescence Hub partners such as Brown University, Central Michigan University, U.C. San Diego, the University of California Los Angeles, and New York University. The work was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation.",
