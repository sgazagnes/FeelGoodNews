      "summary": "Denmark's survival rates record for certain cancers was low compared to other wealthy countries - then it came up with a bold plan",
      "content": "What the NHS can learn from the European country that boosted cancer survival rates\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Hugh Pym Health editor Share Save\n\nBBC\n\n\"It was really bad – we had patients dying on the waiting lists – politicians were getting desperate.\" Jesper Fisker, chief executive of the Danish Cancer Society, is looking back 25 years - to the moment Denmark decided to transform its approach to treating cancer. At that point, he says, the country did not have a strong record. \"It was a disaster,\" he recalls. \"We saw Danish patients out of their own pocket paying for tickets to China to get all sorts of treatments – endangering their health.\" Some went to private hospitals in Germany that offered new treatments unavailable in Denmark. Back then, Denmark's record on cancer was low compared to that of other rich countries. But so was the UK's. From 1995 to 1999, Denmark's five-year survival rate for rectal cancer was essentially tied with the UK's, on around 48%, according to the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, a research body. It put both nations well below countries like Australia, which had a 59% rate.\n\nNow, thanks to a bold plan, Denmark's performance on cancer has jumped ahead. By 2014, its five-year survival rate for rectal cancer had risen to 69%, close to Australia's. (The UK's rose too, but only to 62%.) Analysts think the trend has probably continued (though these are the most up-to-date figures available). And it's a similar story for other cancers, including colon, stomach, and lung. This Danish success story has caught the attention of UK policymakers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting says that aspects of the Danish model are feeding into government plans. Some could well be included in a new long-term cancer plan for England, due to be published in the autumn. So, what's their secret, and can the NHS learn from Denmark?\n\nBig investments and thoughtful touches\n\nWalking today into Herlev Hospital on the outskirts of Copenhagen makes for a rather different experience to arriving at an average NHS hospital. The foyer is hung with bright, vivid paintings by the Danish artist Poul Gernes. There are 65 in all. The philosophy is that endless white walls can unnerve patients, while colour can be a pleasant distraction from their problems.\n\nGetty Images Herlev Hospital near Copenhagen, opened in the 1970s\n\nIt is a sign of the attention Denmark has paid to even the atmosphere of hospitals - small, thoughtful touches, alongside investment in more traditional equipment. Dr Michael Andersen, a consultant radiologist and associate professor at the hospital, shows off a high-tech scanner, only the fourth of its kind used by any hospital around the world. Buying hospital equipment like this - particularly scanners - has been central to Denmark's cancer strategy. \"In 2008 the government made the decision to make a heavy investment into scanner systems,\" Dr Andersen explains. \"They purchased between 30 and 60 - they're an integral part of the way we work.\" Particularly important for cancer are CT scanners, which look deep inside a person's body. Denmark now has about 30 of them per million people - the average of other rich countries stands at 25.9. The UK, meanwhile, lags way behind with just 8.8 scanners per million people, according to the 2021 figures.\n\nGetty Images Vivid artwork by the Danish artist Poul Gernes appears in the hospital. (King Frederik and Queen Mary of Denmark look at his work at the Espoo Museum of Modern Art)\n\nThe investment in cancer equipment, according to experts, led to a huge expansion in diagnostic capacity in Denmark. Unless funding to meet increasing patient demand is made, they argue, England could continue to lag behind on the quality of care. This all comes despite the fact that Denmark's health spending hasn't seen a huge boost. Calculated by spending per head of the population, Denmark is ahead; but as a share of national income, its health spending is similar to, and in fact slightly below that of the UK's.\n\nA bold set of plans\n\nThis is just one part of a bold plan drawn up by Danish health leaders. Along with introducing new equipment, and rethinking the atmosphere of hospitals, they also made it possible for patients to be treated with chemotherapy at home. New national standards govern how quickly Danes must be treated: following a referral, a cancer diagnosis has to be given within two weeks. Then, if treatment is required, it has to start within the two weeks of diagnosis. If these targets are not met patients have the right to transfer to another hospital - or, failing that, another country - whilst still being funded by the Danish health system. This is quite a contrast to the UK nations. Here, the target is for patients to start treatment within around nine weeks (officially, 62 days) of an urgent cancer referral.\n\nGetty Creative The investment in equipment, including CT scanners, led to a huge expansion in diagnostic capacity in Denmark, say experts\n\nMichelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, believes that there is a lack of accountability in the English health system specifically, with too many NHS organisations. Addressing this, she says, should improve the quality of cancer care. \"That means clarity over who in the government and NHS is responsible for delivering each part of the plan. \"Ultimately, responsibility for the success or failure of the plan should rest with the health and social care secretary.\" She points out that there are similarities between England and Denmark's state-run health systems - for example, the roughly similar amount they spend on health as a share of national income, meaning Denmark's example could be followed in England. But this would require a long-term plan, political leadership, higher investment, more cancer screening, and stronger targets. Which is no easy feat.\n\nGoing beyond just 'treating' cancer\n\nElisabeth Ketelsen, who is 82, is an active person, still swimming in international events - she has broken world records for her age group. But in 2022, she discovered a lump in her breast. \"I saw the doctor on Monday – on the following Thursday I had mammography and a biopsy and from then on it went so quickly my head was spinning, almost.\"\n\nElisabeth Ketelsen After her cancer returned, Elisabeth Ketelsen was put on chemotherapy pills and hormone treatment\n\nJust three weeks after the diagnosis Elisabeth, who is from Denmark, had surgery. Radiotherapy started two weeks later. Last year, the cancer reappeared in her spine and she was immediately prescribed chemotherapy pills and hormone treatment. The cancer stabilised and she has come off chemotherapy. She has since returned to the swimming pool, competing at an event in Singapore. \"The system works,\" she tells me. Not all Danish patients are as complimentary, of course, but Danish health officials say their targets for rapid cancer diagnosis are being met for about 80% of their patients.\n\nGetty Images Queen Mary of Denmark visits the Counselling Centre at Herlev Hospital earlier this year\n\nThis all comes down to the idea that Danish authorities are not just trying to treat cancer; they're also keen to improve the experience of patients. Counselling houses, where therapy and companionship are offered to patients, have opened up across the country. These are funded largely by the voluntary sector with a small amount of state funding. (These follow a similar model as the Maggie's cancer support charity in the UK.) Mette Engel, who runs a counselling centre in Copenhagen, tells me mental health is very important in Denmark's cancer plan. \"We see ourselves as a national part of this support system.\"\n\nBenefits of chemotherapy at home\n\nDenmark's move to start treating more cancer patients away from hospitals is also part of this wider shift of Danish healthcare from hospitals into communities. Michael Ziegler, mayor of Høje-Taastrup Municipality near Copenhagen, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2022. After a stem cell transplant, he was back at work within seven months. Ziegler had chemotherapy in his own home, using what's known as a chemo pump. \"I could have some quality of life, being able to do things at home I wanted to do instead of being stuck in a hospital room,\" he says. \"I also think at hospitals there is always at risk of getting infections. The chemo has the effect of reducing my immune system to a very low level so I am vulnerable to infections.\"\n\nGetty Images \"I could have some quality of life instead of being stuck in a hospital room,\" says one patient who had chemotherapy at home in Denmark\n\nThere haven't yet been any major studies and so hard data is limited, but it's thought by some that at-home chemo could potentially boost survival chances by lowering the risk of a patient catching an infection while in hospital. His cancer has since returned and he will be restarting treatment, including more chemotherapy and a new stem cell transplant. He says he is \"feeling optimistic\".\n\nA blueprint for the NHS?\n\nThe Danish health system has certain parallels with the NHS - not least as both are mainly funded by taxpayers. The two nations also face similar challenges when considering the overall health of the population. Alcohol consumption is similar in both nations, though obesity levels in Denmark are lower and smoking rates are higher. (One Danish health leader told me that they were envious of UK initiatives on smoking, with the minimum age for tobacco sales rising each year.) However, there are certain challenges specific to the UK: the population of England, for example, is nearly 10 times larger than Denmark's population. And the NHS is a complex organisation. Still, ministers have made no secret of their interest in the Danish system, with an official visit earlier this year. Wes Streeting, the UK Health Secretary, says: \"Denmark's healthcare system is known the world over for its excellence, having transformed outcomes through its cancer plans, and Health Minister Karin Smyth's trip to the country earlier this year offered us vital insights up close.\" Mr Streeting says these insights have \"fed into\" government health plans to \"speed up cancer diagnoses and deliver cutting edge treatments to the NHS front line quicker\".\n\nMichelle Mitchell of Cancer Research UK agrees that Denmark offers a useful template. \"They are diagnosing cancer earlier, people are surviving longer, more people are taking up screening – all of those factors as well as investment in workforce and kit are critical components of a cancer plan.\" She argues that British health ministers could move towards Danish-style national waiting time targets rather than the UK's current system of \"benchmarks\", which are weaker and haven't been met since 2015.\n\n'This is unfinished business'\n\nThe greater challenge for the NHS though, is that there are so many other problems - crowded A&E departments, overstretched staff and, as one analyst put it, \"multiple fires burning\" - meaning that it can be difficult to persuade health leaders to focus on cancer survival. Ruth Thorlby, assistant director of policy at The Health Foundation think tank, says that policymakers in London and Copenhagen both realised at the same time, in the 1990s, that cancer needed urgent attention and urgent plans were drawn up. But whilst Danish policymakers saw policies through, she argues that in the UK the momentum \"dissipated\", as other priorities and short-term problems emerged. \"This is unfinished business - over the last decade there has been a move away from cancer plans,\" she says.\n\nPA Wire Ruth Thorlby says that while Denmark stuck with its cancer plans, the UK lost momentum as other priorities took over\n\nAt the heart of Denmark's success was a sense of political consensus. From the 1990s onwards, figures from all major parties agreed that cancer should be a priority. This is a level of agreement the UK has not managed to reach, she says. Mr Fisker of the Danish Cancer Society argues that the usual cut-and-thrust of party politics needs to be set aside. \"Politicians must promise each other there is going to be a long, lasting partnership. And health leaders need to operate on a 10-, 15-, 20-year basis,\" he says - longer than the life of any one government or party. But does he think that's possible in the UK? After all, Westminster is not known for much long-term, cross-party thinking. \"If you are really decisive, if you really want to do this and are committed to it over a period of time, and you are also ready to invest then I think it can be done,\" he says. With a pause, he adds: \"Nothing comes without investment.\"",

He presented the results of the phase II study, Neoadjuvant Nivolumab or Nivolumab plus Ipililumab in Resectable Diffuse Pleural Mesothelioma, at the 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer in Barcelona, Spain on September 8 and is lead author of the study published concurrently in the journal Nature Medicine (DOI 10.1038/s41591-025-03958-3).\n\nPhase II clinical trials are designed to assess whether it is possible to deliver innovative treatments to specific patient populations, and whether the potential benefits of the therapy outweigh any adverse effects that patients experience.\n\n\"When looking at patient outcomes to date, the issue of whether any mesothelioma is truly resectable is controversial,\" said Reuss. \"Several major studies have not shown improvement in survival when surgery is incorporated into systemic therapy for mesothelioma. This study incorporates immunotherapy into the treatment of patients who might benefit from surgery.\n\n\"Since they occur in the tissue that lines the lungs, mesotheliomas don't grow and spread like other cancers.\" Reuss said. \"They don't typically form solid masses or nodules. These tumors are more fluid, or diffuse throughout the lining of the lung. That makes it more difficult to use our usual methods to determine how extensive a tumor is or to measure whether a treatment is effective by standard imaging assessments.\"\n\nIn this study, the clinical team worked closely with scientists in the laboratory to test a novel approach studying circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in their patient's blood. Tumors frequently shed cancer DNA into the blood stream. Oncologists can test the blood to detect the presence of this ctDNA, but their role in clinical decision-making is an evolving area of interest. This is particularly challenging in mesothelioma, a tumor type that has a low number of cancer mutations that can be detected by traditional ctDNA techniques.\n\n\"Imaging doesn't always capture what's happening with mesothelioma, especially during treatment,\" said the study's senior author, Valsamo Anagnostou, MD, PhD, the Alex Grass professor of oncology and co-director of the upper aerodigestive cancers program at Johns Hopkins. \"By using an ultra-sensitive genome-wide ctDNA sequencing method, we were able to detect microscopic signs of cancer that imaging missed and predict which patients were most likely to benefit from treatment or experience relapse.\"\n\n\"This approach may give us a baseline to monitor the efficacy of that treatment,\" Reuss said. \"If the ctDNA decreases or disappears, it is a good indication that the therapy is working, If not, it indicates a change in therapy may be warranted.\" Reuss added that further validation of this methodology is required before it can routinely be incorporated into clinical practice.\n\n\"These analyses contribute to our understanding of which patients with mesothelioma may be candidates for surgery,\" Reuss said. \"Up until now, ctDNA assessments have not been part of the clinical landscape in the management of diffuse pleural mesothelioma, but our analyses suggest this may be nearing a change in the future.\"\n\nPhase II clinical trials are not designed to measure the clinical efficacy of treatment options but both arms of this trial showed improvements in the time from treatment to when the tumors began to grow again and overall length of survival.\n\nReuss cautions against drawing conclusions about that data, but notes that the results do provide positive signals about the potential value of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for mesothelioma patients with tumors that can be surgically removed and point the way to future studies.\n\n\"This is a small study,\" he said, \"and it does not tell us whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy will improve outcomes for these patients, but it does open windows of opportunity. We need to take what we learned and do further studies, dig deeper so that we can develop better therapies for patients with mesothelioma.\"\n\nThe study was conducted across multiple academic cancer centers.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Mesothelioma is a rare and hard-to-treat cancer that affects the thin tissue lining the lungs. It mostly happens to people exposed to asbestos and is difficult to see clearly with regular scans because the tumors spread in a fluid-like way rather than forming solid lumps.\n\n**What happened** – A recent phase II clinical trial tested giving immunotherapy medicine before and after surgery to patients with mesothelioma that can be operated on. The study, led by Dr. Joshua Reuss and presented at a world lung cancer conference, also used a new blood test to find tiny amounts of cancer DNA that scans might miss. This helped doctors better understand who would benefit from treatment and surgery.\n\n**Impact** – This approach is important because it offers a new way to detect and track mesothelioma using a simple blood test, making it easier to decide the best treatment. Immunotherapy given around the time of surgery showed encouraging results in slowing tumor growth and helping patients live longer, which is hopeful for a cancer type that has been very tough to treat.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers want to do larger studies to confirm these findings and improve treatments further. They also plan to keep developing the blood test method so it can become a regular tool for doctors managing mesothelioma patients.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Combining immunotherapy with surgery and a new blood test may improve treatment for mesothelioma patients by detecting hidden cancer and guiding better care decisions.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nA simple three-minute test using brainwave technology could provide a new window into the earliest signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Developed by researchers at the University of Bath, the test picks up subtle memory problems linked to Alzheimer’s long before a traditional diagnosis is usually made.\n\n“This shows us that our new passive measure of memory, which we’ve built specifically for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, can be sensitive to those individuals at very high risk but who are not yet diagnosed,” explained Dr. George Stothart, cognitive neuroscientist and lead researcher.\n\nThe hope is that identifying patients earlier could ensure they benefit from emerging Alzheimer’s drugs, such as donanemab and lecanemab, which appear to work best in the disease’s earliest stages.\n\nHow the Fastball test works\n\nThe new screening tool, called the Fastball test, is a form of electroencephalogram (EEG). Small sensors placed on the scalp measure electrical activity in the brain while participants look at a rapid stream of images on a screen.\n\nBefore the test begins, participants are shown eight simple pictures of objects like a ball or a chair, and asked to name them. During the test, they watch hundreds of images flash up at lightning speed, with every fifth picture being one of those eight. Crucially, they are not asked to recall or identify the familiar images.\n\nThe brain’s automatic response reveals whether it recognizes those repeated pictures. In the recent trial, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that mainly affects memory for objects, showed weaker responses than healthy adults or those with non-amnestic MCI. Since people with amnestic MCI face a much higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s, this finding is significant.\n\nWhy this matters for patients\n\nCurrently, Alzheimer’s is often diagnosed late, after symptoms disrupt daily life. The Fastball test cannot predict with certainty who will develop Alzheimer’s, but it may help doctors understand which patients are at high risk earlier than ever before.\n\nDr. Julia Dudley of Alzheimer’s Research UK stressed the importance of this early focus: “New Alzheimer’s treatments are proving to be more effective when given at earlier stages in the disease, therefore earlier diagnosis is key for people to benefit from this.”\n\nDesigned with accessibility in mind\n\nAll of the trial tests were carried out in participants’ homes, something Stothart said is essential for accessibility and reducing anxiety. This design makes the test more practical for widespread use, especially for patients who may feel intimidated by clinical settings.\n\nThe trial, conducted with the University of Bristol, included 54 healthy adults and 52 patients with mild cognitive impairment. Results have been published in Brain Communications, and larger studies are now under way to validate the findings.\n\nExperts call it a promising first step\n\nWhile the results are encouraging, experts say more work is needed. Professor Vladimir Litvak of UCL’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology described it as “an early step towards developing a clinically useful test.” He emphasized that the next challenge is to show whether the Fastball test can track how a person’s condition changes over time and inform treatment decisions.\n\nDudley agreed, adding that longer-term studies in larger and more diverse groups are essential. She also noted that memory problems can stem from many health conditions, not just dementia. Future research will need to clarify how brainwave testing works alongside other tools like cognitive assessments and blood tests.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAlzheimer’s currently affects more than 55 million people worldwide, and finding ways to diagnose it earlier is a pressing priority. While the Fastball test is not a crystal ball, it offers an accessible, non-invasive glimpse into brain function that could one day help patients access life-extending treatments sooner.\n\nAs Stothart and his team push forward, the work underscores a hopeful message: innovation in early detection may give families more time, more choices, and more hope in the face of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nSource study: Brain Communications—A passive and objective measure of recognition memory in mild cognitive impairment using Fastball memory assessment",
