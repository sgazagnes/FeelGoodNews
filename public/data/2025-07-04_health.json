      "title": "Deafness reversed: Single injection brings hearing back within weeks",
      "content": "A cutting-edge gene therapy has significantly restored hearing in children and adults with congenital deafness, showing dramatic results just one month after a single injection. Researchers used a virus to deliver a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear, improving auditory function across all ten participants in the study. The therapy worked best in young children but still benefited adults, with one 7-year-old girl regaining almost full hearing. Even more exciting: this is just the start, as scientists now aim to target other genes that cause more common forms of deafness.",

      "content": "Stanford researchers discovered that dialing down an overactive enzyme, LRRK2, can regrow lost cellular “antennae” in key brain cells, restoring vital dopamine communication and neuroprotective signals in a mouse model of genetic Parkinson’s. After three months on the LRRK2-blocking drug MLi-2, damaged circuits revived and early signs of neuronal recovery emerged, hinting that timely treatment could not only halt but reverse disease progression—and perhaps benefit other Parkinson’s forms.",
