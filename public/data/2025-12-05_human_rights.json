      "content": "We'll end children living in B&Bs, government says\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Hayley Clarke Education reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe government has pledged to stop children growing up in B&Bs and to make childcare more accessible for families on Universal Credit as part of its child poverty strategy. The government says the wide-ranging measures will lift around 550,000 children out of poverty by 2030, marking \"the biggest reduction in a single Parliament since records began\". But the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was \"considerable uncertainty over how large a reduction in measured poverty these policies will ultimately deliver, partly due to genuine economic uncertainty\". Homelessness charities welcomed the plans, but called for greater changes to lift people out of poverty.\n\nIn England alone, more than 172,000 children are living in temporary accommodation. To address this, the government plans to end the \"unlawful placement\" of families in B&Bs beyond six weeks. Councils are currently only meant to house families with children in B&Bs as a last resort, and for a maximium of six weeks, the law says. But figures from April to June 2025 show that more than 2,000 children had been living in B&Bs for longer than that. Child poverty levels are currently at a \"historic high\", the government says, with 4.5 million children - roughly a third - living in relative poverty after housing costs. Three quarters of these come from working families. \"Too many families are struggling without the basics: a secure home, warm meals, and the support they need to make ends meet,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. The government's child poverty strategy comes after it reversed the two-child benefit cap, expanded free school meals to all children from families receiving Universal Credit, and introduced free breakfast clubs. The IFS said ending the two-child benefit cap was forecast to account for 450,000 of the children lifted out of poverty by the end of the Parliament, with the remainder attributable to expanding free school meals. Other announcements, including on temporary accommodation, were targeted at \"much smaller groups of people\", it added.\n\nShadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said: \"You don't lift children out of poverty by making the whole country poorer.\" She said work was \"the best way out of poverty\", adding: \"Only the Conservatives have a credible plan to grow the economy, support parents back into work and tackle child poverty.\" The government says the \"devastating impact\" on children living in temporary accomodation includes damage to physical and mental health, missing school and family disruption. James Cassidy, headteacher of Eton Park Junior Academy in Burton-upon-Trent, told the BBC that he increasingly sees pupils coming into school tired, anxious and stressed, having a knock-on effect on their concentration and friendships. He said the \"vast majority\" of pupils' families were experiencing difficulties with the cost of living and retaining long-term employment. The government's measures on housing are \"so welcomed\", Mr Cassidy said, adding that in his experience, families often try to cope alone when placed in temporary accommodation.\n\nHeadteacher James Cassidy said he increasingly sees pupils coming into school tired, anxious and stressed\n\nUnder the government's plans, councils will also have a new legal duty to notify schools, health visitors and GPs when a child is placed in temporary accommodation to provide \"a more joined up\" approach to supporting them. The government confirmed that it will continue an £8m pilot to reduce dependence on B&Bs as emergency accomodation in the 20 local authorities with the highest use over the next three years. It also plans to build 5,000 homes that can be used as more suitable temporary accommodation by 2020 as part of its upcoming homelessness strategy. Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza says it is a welcome focus on improving the quality of temporary accommodation, where many children live in \"shocking Dickensian conditions\". Homelessness charity Shelter agreed with the government that \"no child should be growing up in a B&B or mouldy bedsit\". But it called on ministers to \"get children out of temporary accommodation and into permanent homes\" by unfreezing housing benefits and building a new generation of social rent homes. The Health Foundation said the strategy marked progress, but \"must go further\" to deliver a \"preventative approach that tackles the deep structural causes of poverty\". Meanwhile, the founder of the Big Issue magazine Lord John Bird said the government's strategy was lacking \"ambitious targets\". \"In this challenging economic climate, there is every reason to worry warm words will not translate into tangible progress,\" he said.\n\nPepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the plans will make a \"real difference\" but called for \"more than just these policies in isolation\". \"A cross-Whitehall response, backed by widespread investment, is required,\" he said.\n\nMore accessible childcare is also included in the strategy, the government says, as childcare costs are one of the biggest barriers for getting back to work, with many struggling to cover upfront fees before getting their first payslip. It has pledged a rule change from next year to extend eligibility for upfront childcare costs to people returning from parental leave, which it said will make it easier for new parents who receive Universal Credit to return to work. Other measures include helping parents to save money on baby formula.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In England, over 172,000 children live in temporary housing like bed and breakfasts (B&Bs), which are meant to be short-term solutions. Many families also struggle with the high cost of childcare, making it hard for parents on Universal Credit to work. Child poverty is a big problem, with about 4.5 million children living in relative poverty after housing costs.\n\n**What happened** – The government announced a new child poverty strategy to stop children from living in B&Bs longer than six weeks, which is currently against the law but still happens. They also plan to make childcare more affordable and easier to access for families receiving Universal Credit, especially for parents returning to work after parental leave. The strategy aims to lift around 550,000 children out of poverty by 2030, the biggest drop ever recorded in one Parliament.\n\n**Impact** – This plan is important because living in temporary accommodation can harm children’s health, school attendance, and family life. Schools report seeing more tired and anxious children due to these struggles. The strategy also includes new rules for councils to inform schools and doctors when children move into temporary housing, helping support these children better. Making childcare more affordable helps parents work and support their families.\n\n**What's next step** – The government will continue a pilot program to reduce B&B use in the hardest-hit areas and build 5,000 new homes for temporary housing by 2030. They will also expand childcare support starting next year. Experts say more action and investment are needed, but these steps are a start toward better living conditions and support for families.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The government’s new plan aims to end long stays in unsuitable housing for children and make childcare easier for families, helping lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty by 2030.",

Beaucoup de familles ont aussi du mal à payer la garde d'enfants, ce qui complique le retour au travail des parents bénéficiaires de l'Universal Credit. La pauvreté infantile est un problème important, avec environ 4,5 millions d'enfants vivant dans la pauvreté relative après les coûts du logement.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Le gouvernement a annoncé une nouvelle stratégie contre la pauvreté infantile pour empêcher que les enfants restent plus de six semaines dans des chambres d'hôtes, ce qui est illégal mais arrive encore. Il prévoit aussi de rendre la garde d'enfants plus abordable et accessible pour les familles recevant l'Universal Credit, notamment pour les parents revenant au travail après un congé parental. L'objectif est de sortir environ 550 000 enfants de la pauvreté d'ici 2030, soit la plus grande baisse jamais enregistrée en un seul Parlement.\n\n**Impact** – Ce plan est important car vivre dans un logement temporaire peut nuire à la santé des enfants, à leur présence à l'école et à la vie familiale. Les écoles constatent que de plus en plus d'enfants sont fatigués et anxieux à cause de ces difficultés. La stratégie prévoit aussi que les conseils informent les écoles et les médecins quand un enfant est placé en logement temporaire pour mieux les soutenir. Faciliter la garde d'enfants aide les parents à travailler et à subvenir aux besoins de leur famille.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – Le gouvernement poursuivra un programme pilote pour réduire l'utilisation des chambres d'hôtes dans les zones les plus touchées et construira 5 000 nouveaux logements temporaires d'ici 2030. Le soutien à la garde d'enfants sera étendu dès l'année prochaine. Les experts estiment que plus d'actions et d'investissements sont nécessaires, mais ces mesures marquent un début vers de meilleures conditions de vie et un meilleur soutien pour les familles.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le nouveau plan du gouvernement vise à mettre fin aux longs séjours des enfants dans des logements inadaptés et à faciliter la garde d'enfants, aidant ainsi à sortir des centaines de milliers d'enfants de la pauvreté d'ici 2030.",

The film “All Monsters Are Human,” by British filmmakers Hugh Davies and Helen Spooner, emerged from that silence, documenting the stories of three queer Azerbaijanis — Roma, Lady Cat, and Lisa — whose lives move between Baku and Istanbul, a common migration route for trans women from the region who are seeking safety.\n\nThrough a hybrid form that combines interviews and animation, the film gives visual shape to traumas that are difficult to articulate. The animated segments soften unbearable memories, creating a space where pain becomes perceivable but not voyeuristic. The result is a sensitive and emotionally charged film that resists sensationalism despite being made by foreign directors. Its Western gaze does not objectify its subjects; instead, it amplifies their agency and dignity in the face of systemic violence.\n\nRoma recounts surviving sexual assault and police brutality. Lady Cat continues sex work, at once a form of both survival and erasure. In one of the most moving sequences, the memory of Kristina, a trans woman killed in Istanbul, is reconstructed through her mother’s recollections. The filmmakers travelled to Azerbaijan to speak to her, revealing the unbearable contradiction between maternal tenderness and social cruelty: Kristina, once chained by her father, is remembered as someone who would share her last piece of bread.\n\nFrom mockery to self-representation\n\nThe first homosexual character in Azerbaijani cinema appeared only in 2014, in the comedy “My Name is Intigam,” directed by Emin Abdullayev. As in much post-Soviet cinema, queerness was permitted only as caricature – an instrument of irony, ridicule, or fear. For decades, mainstream film reinforced heteronormative ideology by relegating queer figures to punchlines, ensuring they could never be seen as full human subjects.\n\nEven today, there are no mainstream Azerbaijani films that positively portray LGBTQI+ lives, and international queer cinema remains largely absent from local screens. Yet, anxiety about the “spread” of queer themes has already reached the film community.\n\n“There has been overt propaganda of homosexuality and sexual minorities in world cinema in recent years, and I have been worried about this for a long time,” said Ayaz Salayev, a respected director and state-honoured art worker, in an interview with local media. “If Azerbaijani cinema follows the Western path and makes such films to win awards, it could deal a big blow to national cinema.”\n\nIn an article for Yeni Musavat titled “A Homosexual Film Industry Has Been Emerging All Over the World. What Is the Goal?”, film critic Sevda Sultanova argued that the West’s struggle for gender equality has limited academic freedom and debate. “The organisers of the Berlin Film Festival removed the gender principle, replacing Best Actor and Best Actress awards with gender-neutral ones,” she claimed. “Thus, one of the world’s most influential festivals violated the rights of actors and actresses under pressure from sexual minorities.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the appearance of non-binary and trans authors who tell their own stories marks a significant shift from being looked at to looking back. These filmmakers, many of them graduates of the Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Arts, are reclaiming cinema as a space of resistance and self-creation. Their works, often produced with symbolic budgets, are less about technical polish and more about the audacity to exist on screen.\n\nWhile earlier one-off activist films, such as “Sebastian” (2017) by LGBTQI+ activist Samad Ismayilov, offered rare glimpses into queer life, a younger generation is now shaping a more sustained body of work. These artists are developing what can be described as a queer gaze – one that challenges normative representations, foregrounds LGBTQI+ subjectivities, and constructs alternative visual languages for what mainstream culture rejects.\n\nNew voices of queer cinema\n\nVusala Hajiyeva turned her own life story into “Bunny Decides to Go,” portraying the pressures she faced in Azerbaijan and the circumstances that ultimately forced her to relocate to Tbilisi, Georgia. The film received significant international attention, screening at nearly twenty film festivals following its world premiere at the Oslo Fusion International Film Festival. Hajiyeva also directed “A and 24 Others” (2022), revisiting the 2017 LGBTQI+ crackdown, and the shorts “Anyone from Istanbul” (2024) and “Leave the Room, Make a Mistake” (2024).\n\n“My main purpose in making this film was to analyse what had happened to me on a personal level and to look at the years after my transition from the outside,” she explained. Using personal archives, photographs, and intimate handheld camerawork, Hajiyeva reconstructs her early memories — wearing her mother’s clothes in secret, playing with her cousins’ dolls — situating them within a broader journey of self-discovery. Feelings of loneliness and isolation are visualised through a shift from a chaotic family dining table to a minimalist, solitary one. “Home is not always a comfort zone. Sometimes home can turn into hell,” she says in her voiceover.\n\nTwo sources of strength remain for her: her partner and rap music. The rabbit motif emerges from these relationships: her mother’s first gift was a toy rabbit, while her partner remembers losing a beloved real rabbit from childhood. The symbol becomes a metaphor for fragility and flight. Rap music becomes her second refuge: protest, expression, a rhythm of survival. She briefly abandoned it due to “dysphoria and fear,” but returned to it after a violent attack on her home. Threatening calls from relatives and hostile stares in public ultimately forced her to flee to Tbilisi overnight: “When everything around you becomes unsafe, escape becomes the only option.”\n\nWhile not ideal, Tbilisi offers relative freedom. The film ends on a hopeful note, with an image of a small girl walking through Baku with a confident stride, ignoring the stares around her, moving forward toward a new life.\n\nShining the spotlight on LGBTQI+ stories\n\nTrans screenwriter and director Miray Deniz, another graduate of the Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Arts, is among the few consistently foregrounding LGBTQI+ experiences. Her earlier film “Sunshine for My Body” portrayed a lesbian couple, a trans woman seeking family, and a gay teenager navigating relationship difficulties.\n\nHer film “Queer Destiny: Avaz Hafizli” examines the life and legacy of 23-year-old blogger and LGBTQI+ rights defender Avaz Hafizli, who was murdered by his cousin on February 22, 2022 “for disgracing the family name.” Both the funeral and the subsequent court proceedings revealed the depth of homophobia in Azerbaijan: friends were barred from attending the trial, the hate crime dimension was ignored, and although Hafizli’s mother demanded the harshest punishment, his brother publicly forgave the perpetrator. As mentioned in the film, following pressure by friends and activists like Ali Malikov, the killer received a nine-and-a-half-year sentence.\n\nA QueerRadar investigation found that between 2013 and 2023, at least 15 LGBTQI+ people in Azerbaijan were attacked with weapons and 12 killed. These figures, however, are likely underreported due to the absence of proper investigation and the lack of a hate crime classification in national law.\n\nDeniz's film reconstructs Hafizli’s life through interviews with his mother, friends, and colleagues, blending them with archival footage. His activism, his constant presence at protests, and his efforts to document trans murders place him at the heart of Azerbaijan’s queer struggle. Yet, his murder was framed by some as “a deserved death,” a narrative echoed in pro-government media.\n\nThe film chronicles how hate speech fuels violence and endangers lives. Although Hafizli repeatedly reported threats, officials ignored him. His suicide attempt, also related in the film, underscores the psychological toll queer Azerbaijanis often endure; it also recalls the 2014 suicide of activist Isa Shahmarli, who hanged himself using the rainbow flag — another life pushed to the brink.\n\nEven in death, discrimination persisted for Hafizli, who was denied a proper burial and a gravestone. As journalist Nurlan Libre noted in the film, some family members want the grave to “disappear.” In the face of such attitudes, Judith Butler’s concept of “grievability” — the idea that some lives are not seen as worthy of mourning — becomes painfully visible.\n\nSearching for home\n\nMehriban Karimova, whose background is in long-term photojournalism and photography, addresses prejudice and discrimination against transgender women in the film “Home Within,” which was screened at the Oslo Fusion International Film Festival and the Sevil International Women’s Documentary Film Festival in Azerbaijan.\n\nExamining home as both a physical space and an emotional state, the film follows Karmen, a 20-year-old student living in her friend’s apartment. Having begun her transition while living in a dormitory, Karmen sees home as a place of safety, authenticity, and warmth — but those qualities become fragile. She recalls feeling truly at home only in her grandmother’s house, an early sanctuary she did not want to leave.\n\nTo find her “inner home,” Karmen has had to sacrifice her “outer home.” Although she now says she feels comfortable in her friend’s apartment, she also recounts receiving a sexual proposition from a former landlord who offered to lower the rent in exchange for sex — an offer that later came from others as well. For her, home has transformed into a space filled with conditions, limitations, and danger. Her bright personality is overshadowed by traumatic memories. The film shows how even basic needs, such as walking freely on the street, become challenges for queer people.\n\nAlthough Azerbaijan has no identifiable “New Queer Cinema” movement, these independently made films are beginning to fill the void left by decades of silence. They challenge post-Soviet conservatism and heteronormative cinematic language by reclaiming the power of looking — what feminist and queer theorists call the queer gaze. This gaze also interrogates the meaning of home, pushing beyond the physical to explore belonging, safety, and identity.\n\nA striking throughline in these works is the exploration of home as both a refuge and a site of danger. For Hajiyeva in “Bunny Decides to Go,” home is a place that must be left behind to survive, yet it remains deeply entwined with memory and emotional attachment. Hafizli’s story in “Queer Destiny” reveals how, without family protection, even home becomes unsafe, culminating in fatal violence. Karimova’s “Home Within” examines home as an emotional and social construct, revealing the compromises, dangers, and exclusions that trans people face even within seemingly ordinary domestic spaces.\n\nTaken together, these films portray a generation searching for the meaning of home in a society that denies them safety and recognition. They transform personal struggles into collective narratives, illustrating how survival, memory, and the quest for belonging are intertwined with the creation of queer cinematic histories. By mapping the contours of home, both lost and imagined, these films chart a collective history of queer life in Azerbaijan, preserving memory where official records fail.\n\nFor this generation of artists, cinema is not merely a call for visibility; it is an act of documentation, defiance, and remembrance. Together, they continue to create an alternative archive — one where pain, memory, and identity coexist without apology, and where the very act of making films becomes a form of survival.",
