      "title": "Light has been hiding a magnetic secret for nearly 200 years",
      "summary": "New research shows that light’s magnetic field is far more influential than scientists once believed. The team found that this magnetic component significantly affects how light rotates as it passes through certain materials. Their work challenges a 180-year-old understanding of the Faraday Effect and opens pathways to new optical and magnetic technologies.",
      "content": "Researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have found that the magnetic component of light plays a direct part in the Faraday Effect, overturning a 180-year belief that only light's electric field was involved. Their work shows that light can exert magnetic influence on matter, not simply illuminate it. This insight could support advances in optics, spintronics, and emerging quantum technologies.\n\nThe team's findings, published in Nature's Scientific Reports, show that the magnetic portion of light, not only its electric one, has a meaningful and measurable influence on how light interacts with materials. This result contradicts a scientific explanation that has shaped the understanding of the Faraday Effect since the nineteenth century.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Amir Capua and Benjamin Assouline of the university's Institute of Electrical Engineering and Applied Physics, offers the first theoretical evidence that the oscillating magnetic field of light contributes directly to the Faraday Effect. This effect describes how the polarization of light rotates as it travels through a material placed in a constant magnetic field.\n\nHow Light and Magnetism Interact\n\n\"In simple terms, it's an interaction between light and magnetism,\" says Dr. Capua. \"The static magnetic field 'twists' the light, and the light, in turn, reveals the magnetic properties of the material. What we've found is that the magnetic part of light has a first-order effect, it's surprisingly active in this process.\"\n\nFor nearly two centuries, scientists attributed the Faraday Effect solely to the electric field of light interacting with electric charges in matter. The new study shows that the magnetic field of light also plays a direct role by interacting with atomic spins, a contribution long assumed to be insignificant.\n\nCalculating the Magnetic Contribution\n\nUsing advanced calculations informed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which describes how spins behave in magnetic materials, the researchers demonstrated that light's magnetic field can generate magnetic torque within a material in a manner similar to a static magnetic field. Capua explains, \"In other words, light doesn't just illuminate matter, it magnetically influences it.\"\n\nTo measure the extent of that influence, the team applied their theoretical model to Terbium Gallium Garnet (TGG), a crystal commonly used to study the Faraday Effect. Their analysis revealed that the magnetic component of light is responsible for about 17% of the observed rotation in the visible spectrum and as much as 70% in the infrared.\n\nNew Pathways for Future Technologies\n\n\"Our results show that light 'talks' to matter not only through its electric field, but also through its magnetic field, a component that has been largely overlooked until now,\" says Benjamin Assouline.\n\nThe researchers note that this revised understanding of light's magnetic behavior could open doors for innovations in optical data storage, spintronics, and magnetic control using light. The work may also contribute to future developments in spin-based quantum computing.",

      "summary": "Operating a new device named the Fusion Z-pinch Experiment 3, or FuZE-3, Zap Energy has now achieved plasmas with electron pressures as high as 830 megapascals (MPa), or 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) total, comparable to the pressures found deep below Earth’s crust.",
      "content": "Zap Energy has reached a major milestone with its Fusion Z-pinch Experiment 3, known as FuZE-3. The device has generated plasmas with electron pressures up to 830 megapascals (MPa), or a total pressure of 1.6 gigapascals (GPa), a level similar to the intense conditions found deep beneath Earth's crust. This marks the highest pressure ever recorded in a sheared-flow-stabilized Z pinch and represents a significant step toward achieving scientific energy gain, or Q>1.\n\nFuZE-3 is also the first system from Zap to use a third electrode, which allows the mechanisms responsible for accelerating and compressing the plasma to be controlled independently. Early findings were shared during the American Physical Society's Division of Plasma Physics meeting in Long Beach, California.\n\n\"There are some big changes in FuZE-3 compared to Zap's previous systems and it's great to see it perform this well so quickly out of the gate,\" says Colin Adams, Head of Experimental Physics.\n\nWhy Extreme Pressure Matters for Fusion\n\nProducing energy from fusion requires plasma that is both extremely hot and extremely dense. Pressure, which reflects both temperature and density, plays a central role because higher pressure allows more fusion reactions to take place. Some fusion systems focus on reaching the highest pressures possible, while others compensate by confining plasma for longer periods. Zap's sheared-flow-stabilized Z pinch seeks a balance between strong compression and sustained confinement.\n\nThe team's top single-shot electron pressure measurement so far is 830 MPa. Because plasma contains electrons and much heavier ions, and both are expected to reach similar temperatures, the combined plasma pressure (electrons and ions) is estimated at around 1.6 GPa. To put this in perspective, one gigapascal is roughly ten thousand times the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level, or about ten times the pressure at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.\n\nThese pressures were maintained for about a microsecond (one millionth of a second) and measured using optical Thomson scattering, a technique regarded as the most reliable method for determining plasma conditions.\n\nRecent experiments with FuZE-3 have produced multiple repeatable shots with electron densities between 3-5x1024 m-3 and electron temperatures above 1 keV (equal to 21,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\"This was a major effort by the team that was successful because of a tightly coupled cycle of theoretical predictions, computational modeling, rapid build and test engineering, experimental validation, and measurement expertise,\" says Ben Levitt, Vice President of R&D. \"With a smaller system we have the benefit of being able to move quickly, and achieving these results in systems that are a fraction of the size and cost of fusion devices of comparable performance is a big part of what makes this such a significant accomplishment.\"\n\nDesigning FuZE-3 for Higher Fusion Performance\n\nFuZE-3 is the third version of the FuZE platform and the fifth sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch device that Zap has built. The original FuZE machine, which was the first to reach temperatures above 1 keV, has since been retired. FuZE-Q, which remains in operation, is currently the company's top performer in terms of power and fusion neutron yield.\n\nThe goal for FuZE-3 is to reach higher values of the triple product, a key fusion metric that combines density, temperature and confinement time. To support this, the system includes three electrodes and two capacitor banks.\n\nIndependent Control of Acceleration and Compression\n\nEarlier Z-pinch tests at Zap relied on a single electrical pulse moving between two electrodes, which required the same power source to both accelerate the plasma to create stabilizing flow and compress it into a Z pinch.\n\n\"The capability to independently control plasma acceleration and compression gives us a new dial to tune the physics and increase the plasma density,\" says Adams. \"The two-electrode systems have been effective at heating, but lacked the compression targeted in our theoretical models.\"\n\nAlthough the new data show very high pressures, Zap's approach is based on quasi-steady-state magnetic confinement. This is different from inertial fusion systems that rely on intense, nanosecond-long pulses from large arrays of lasers (or in some cases other Z-pinches) to rapidly crush a target. For Zap's method, controlling the stabilizing flow that keeps the plasma well behaved is just as critical as achieving strong compression.\n\nEarly Progress and the Push Toward Higher Triple Products\n\nZap's newest findings from FuZE-3 are still preliminary as the team continues active experimental campaigns. Additional insights are being shared at the APS DPP meeting, and the group intends to publish detailed results in scientific journals in the coming months.\n\n\"We're really just getting started with FuZE-3,\" says Levitt. \"It was built and commissioned just recently, we're generating lots of high-quality shots with high repeatability, and we have plenty of headroom to continue making rapid progress in fusion performance. We'll be integrating lessons from FuZE-3 into our next generation systems as we continue advancing toward commercial fusion.\"\n\nTesting on FuZE-3 will continue while Zap prepares to bring another next generation FuZE device online this winter. Work on future power plant systems is progressing at the same time, supported by the Century demonstration platform.\n\nAbout Zap Energy\n\nZap Energy is developing a compact, lower-cost fusion system that confines and compresses plasma without the large and complex magnetic coils used in many other approaches. The company's sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch technology promises more favorable fusion economics and requires far less capital than conventional designs. Zap Energy employs 150 people in Seattle and San Diego and is supported by leading strategic and financial investors.",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 20 November 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03798-8Multiple lines of evidence suggest that pigeons sense magnetic fields by detecting electric currents in their inner ears.",
      "content": "Credit: Suriya Silsaksom/Alamy\n\nPigeons can sense Earth’s magnetic field by detecting tiny electrical currents in their inner ears, researchers suggest. Such an inner compass could help to explain how certain animals can achieve astonishing feats of long-distance navigation.\n\nThe team performed advanced brain mapping as well single-cell RNA sequencing of pigeon inner-ear cells. Both lines of evidence point to the inner ear as the birds’ ‘magnetoreception’ organ. The results appeared in the Science on 20 November 1.\n\n“This is probably the clearest demonstration of the neural pathways responsible for magnetic processing in any animal,” says Eric Warrant, a sensory biology researcher at the University of Lund in Sweden. Studies have suggested that various animals, including turtles, trout and robins, can sense the direction and strength of magnetic fields, although the evidence has sometimes been contested — and the mechanisms have remained controversial.\n\nBird-brained navigation\n\nTwo leading hypotheses have led the research into how birds sense magnetic fields. One is a quantum-physics effect in retina cells where birds ‘see’ magnetic fields. Another is that microscopic iron oxide particles in the beak could act as tiny compass needles. However, it’s largely unknown where magnetic information is sensed in animals’ brains and how sensory neurons confer sensitivity to electromagnetic changes.\n\nIn 2011, researchers found hints that magnetic fields triggered pigeons’ vestibular system, the organ that enables vertebrates to sense accelerations (including gravity) and helps them to stay balanced2. The structure is made of three fluid-filled loops which are mutually perpendicular, so they can communicate to the brain the direction of an acceleration by breaking it down into three ‘x, y, z’ components.\n\nCompass protein attracts heap of criticism\n\nDavid Keays, a neuroscientist at Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, designed an experiment that could reveal how pigeons’ brains respond to magnetic fields.\n\nKeays’ team exposed six pigeons to a magnetic field slightly stronger than Earth’s for just over an hour. The birds’ heads were immobilized and the magnetic field was continually rotated to simulate the heads’ motions with respect to Earth’s geomagnetic field.\n\nNext, the team used a method for measuring activation patterns of neurons across the brain — by measuring a genetic marker of cell activity in pigeon brains made transparent by a technique called clearing. Maps of brain activity in birds that had been exposed to magnetic fields were compared to a control group that had not been exposed to magnetic fields.\n\nThe results showed neuronal activity related to magnetic fields in the brain region that receives input from the vestibular system, as well as in regions that help to integrate various sensory stimuli. This result narrowed down the list of potential compasses to one — the vestibular system — although it did not explain how pigeon neurons can physically sense magnetic fields.\n\nA magnetic sense organ\n\nIn principle, a conducting material in an organism could produce electric currents in response to magnetic fields, giving an animal a ‘magnetic sense’ — a mechanism that has been proposed as early as 1882 by French zoologist Camille Viguier3.\n\nIn previous research, Keays had looked for a molecular mechanism of this magnetoreception by following inspiration from the biophysics of sharks and skates, which have organs that sense minute electric fields to help them find prey4. These animals express a protein sensitive to changes in neurons’ electrical activity, but modified with a 10-amino-acid-long insertion that allows them to sense electrical currents generated from magnetic fields.",

      "content": "Most molecules of chemistry and biology are chiral, leading to mirror image variants, so called enantiomers. However, while the selective chemical synthesis of molecules where the stereogenicity arises from a carbon atom is well-established, enantioselective approaches to nitrogen-stereogenic molecules are much less common,1-3 and in case of acyclic, N-stereogenic amines, even elusive, due to their rapid pyramidal inversion. We describe here the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of stable, acyclic N-stereogenic amines by the addition of enol silanes to nitronium ions that ion pair to a confined chiral anion. In the produced so-called anomeric amines, the commonly observed isomerization is slowed down by two N-oxy-substituents, which hamper nitrogen inversion. The critical stereogenicity creating step challenges previously established stereochemical descriptors of enantiodifferentiation. Computational studies provide additional insight into the origin of the observed stereocontrol. Our work opens up a new avenue to investigate the fascinating and previously underexplored chemistry of enantiopure anomeric amines.",

      "personality_title": "Scientists develop new method to create stable nitrogen-based molecules",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many molecules in chemistry and biology have mirror-image forms called enantiomers. Usually, these differences come from carbon atoms, but molecules with nitrogen atoms that create these mirror images are much harder to make and study, especially when the nitrogen is part of a flexible, chain-like structure.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers discovered a new way to make stable nitrogen-based molecules with specific three-dimensional shapes. They used a chemical process that adds certain groups to nitrogen compounds, which slows down a flipping motion that normally makes these shapes hard to keep. This method relies on a catalyst that controls the molecule’s shape during the reaction.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it allows scientists to create nitrogen-containing molecules with precise shapes that were difficult or impossible to make before. Such molecules are useful in designing new medicines and materials because their shape affects how they work in the body or in chemical reactions.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists can now explore many new nitrogen-based molecules with this method, studying their properties and potential uses. This could lead to new drugs or materials with improved functions.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new chemical method now makes it possible to create stable nitrogen-based molecules with specific shapes, opening doors for advances in medicine and chemistry.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – De nombreuses molécules en chimie et en biologie ont des formes en image miroir appelées énantiomères. Habituellement, ces différences viennent des atomes de carbone, mais les molécules où l'azote crée ces images miroir sont beaucoup plus difficiles à fabriquer et à étudier, surtout lorsque l'azote fait partie d'une structure flexible en chaîne.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs ont découvert une nouvelle façon de fabriquer des molécules à base d'azote stables avec des formes tridimensionnelles spécifiques. Ils ont utilisé un procédé chimique qui ajoute certains groupes aux composés d'azote, ce qui ralentit un mouvement de bascule qui rend normalement ces formes difficiles à conserver. Cette méthode utilise un catalyseur qui contrôle la forme de la molécule pendant la réaction.\n\n**Impact** – C’est important car cela permet aux scientifiques de créer des molécules contenant de l'azote avec des formes précises, ce qui était difficile voire impossible auparavant. Ces molécules sont utiles pour concevoir de nouveaux médicaments et matériaux, car leur forme influence leur fonctionnement dans le corps ou dans les réactions chimiques.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques peuvent maintenant explorer de nombreuses nouvelles molécules à base d'azote avec cette méthode, étudier leurs propriétés et leurs usages potentiels. Cela pourrait conduire à de nouveaux médicaments ou matériaux aux fonctions améliorées.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Une nouvelle méthode chimique permet désormais de créer des molécules stables à base d'azote avec des formes spécifiques, ouvrant la voie à des avancées en médecine et en chimie.",
