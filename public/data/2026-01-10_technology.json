      "title": "An old jeweler’s trick could change nuclear timekeeping",
      "summary": "A team of physicists has discovered a surprisingly simple way to build nuclear clocks using tiny amounts of rare thorium. By electroplating thorium onto steel, they achieved the same results as years of work with delicate crystals — but far more efficiently. These clocks could be vastly more precise than current atomic clocks and work where GPS fails, from deep space to underwater submarines. The advance could transform navigation, communications, and fundamental physics research.",
      "content": "Last year, researchers led by UCLA achieved a milestone that physicists had pursued for half a century. They succeeded in making radioactive thorium nuclei absorb and release photons in a controlled way, similar to how electrons behave inside atoms. The idea was first proposed by the team in 2008, and its realization is expected to open the door to a new generation of extremely precise clocks. These advances could dramatically improve navigation systems and may even help scientists test whether some of nature's fundamental constants change over time.\n\nDespite the breakthrough, a serious limitation remained. The specific isotope required for nuclear clocks, thorium-229, is found only in weapons-grade uranium. As a result, scientists estimate that only about 40 grams of this material exist worldwide for clock research, making efficiency a critical challenge.\n\nA simpler approach uses far less thorium\n\nAn international collaboration led by UCLA physicist Eric Hudson has now found a way around this bottleneck. The team discovered how to reproduce their earlier results while using only a tiny fraction of the thorium previously required. Their new method, reported in Nature, is straightforward and inexpensive, raising the possibility that nuclear clocks could one day become small and affordable enough for widespread use.\n\nIf that happens, these clocks could move beyond laboratories and replace timing systems in power grids, cell phone towers, and GPS satellites. They may even shrink enough to fit into phones or wristwatches. The technology could also enable navigation in places where GPS signals cannot reach, including deep space and underwater environments such as submarines.\n\nFifteen years of work replaced by a simple technique\n\nHudson's team spent 15 years developing the specialized thorium-doped fluoride crystals that enabled their original success. In those experiments, thorium-229 atoms were bonded with fluorine in a carefully engineered structure. The resulting crystals stabilized the thorium while remaining transparent to the laser light needed to excite the atomic nucleus. However, the process proved extremely difficult, and producing the crystals required relatively large amounts of thorium.\n\n\"We did all the work of making the crystals because we thought the crystal had to be transparent for the laser light to reach the thorium nuclei. The crystals are really challenging to fabricate. It takes forever and the smallest amount of thorium we can use is 1 milligram, which is a lot when there's only 40 or so grams available,\" said first author and UCLA postdoctoral researcher Ricky Elwell, who received the 2025 Deborah Jin Award for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in Atomic, Molecular, or Optical Physics for last year's breakthrough.\n\nBorrowing a method from jewelry making\n\nIn the new study, the researchers took a very different approach. They deposited an extremely thin layer of thorium onto stainless steel using electroplating, a technique commonly used in jewelry. Electroplating, developed in the early 1800s, relies on an electric current to move metal atoms through a conductive solution and coat one surface with another metal. For example, gold or silver is often electroplated onto less valuable metals.\n\n\"It took us five years to figure out how to grow the fluoride crystals and now we've figured out how to get the same results with one of the oldest industrial techniques and using 1,000 times less thorium. Further, the finished product is essentially a small piece of steel and much tougher than the fragile crystals,\" said Hudson.\n\nRethinking how nuclear excitation works\n\nThe success of the new system came from realizing that a long-standing assumption was incorrect. Scientists had believed that thorium needed to be embedded in a transparent material so laser light could reach and excite the nucleus. The team found that exciting the nucleus enough to observe its energy transition was far easier than previously thought.\n\n\"Everyone had always assumed that in order to excite and then observe the nuclear transition, the thorium needed to be embedded in a material that was transparent to the light used to excite the nucleus. In this work, we showed that is simply not true,\" said Hudson. \"We can still force enough light into these opaque materials to excite nuclei near the surface, and then, instead of emitting photons like they do in transparent material such as the crystals, they emit electrons which can be detected simply by monitoring an electrical current -- which is just about the easiest thing you can do in the lab!\"\n\nWhy nuclear clocks matter beyond the lab\n\nBeyond improving communication networks, radar systems, and power grid synchronization, ultra-precise clocks could solve a major national security concern: navigation without GPS. If a bad actor -- or even an electromagnetic storm -- disrupted enough satellites, GPS-based navigation would fail. Submarines already rely on atomic clocks while submerged, but existing clocks drift over time, forcing vessels to surface after weeks to confirm their position.\n\nNuclear clocks are far less sensitive to environmental disturbances, making them especially valuable in situations where accuracy must be maintained for long periods without external signals.\n\n\"The UCLA team's approach could help reduce the cost and complexity of future thorium-based nuclear clocks,\" said Makan Mohageg, optical clock lead at Boeing Technology Innovation. \"Innovations like these may contribute to more compact, high-stability timekeeping, relevant to several aerospace applications.\"\n\nA foundation for future space exploration\n\nMore accurate clocks are also essential for long-distance space travel, where precise timing underpins navigation and communication.\n\n\"The UCLA group led by Eric Hudson has done amazing work in teasing out a viable way to probe the nuclear transition in thorium -- work extending over more than a decade. This work opens the way to a viable thorium clock,\" said Eric Burt, who leads the High Performance Atomic Clock project at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and was not involved in the research. \"In my opinion, thorium nuclear clocks could also revolutionize fundamental physics measurements that can be performed with clocks, such as tests of Einstein's theory of relativity. Due to their inherent low sensitivity to environmental perturbations, future thorium clocks may also be useful in setting up a solar-system-wide time scale essential for establishing a permanent human presence on other planets.\"\n\nResearch collaboration and funding\n\nThe research was supported by the National Science Foundation and involved physicists from the University of Manchester, University of Nevada Reno, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Ziegler Analytics, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität at Mainz, and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.",

      "content": "The Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak is a nuclear-fusion research reactor in Hefei, China.Credit: Zhang Yazi/China News Service/VCG via Getty\n\nResearchers working on China’s ‘artificial sun’ have reported breaking a long-accepted threshold that has limited the operation of nuclear-fusion reactors for decades.\n\nChina’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) is a nuclear-fusion research reactor in Hefei. Researchers hope that it will one day produce clean, nearly limitless energy by replicating the fusion processes that power the Sun.\n\nIn fusion reactors, light-weight atoms are compressed under extreme pressure and heat to form heavier atoms. This process releases energy, but it must be optimized carefully so that the reactor produces more energy than it consumes.\n\nOne of the most promising reactor designs, the tokamak, confines plasma inside a doughnut-shaped chamber using magnetic fields. The plasma is then heated. To sustain fusion reactions, the plasma must reach an extremely high density — meaning many particles must be packed into a small volume.\n\nBut researchers thought that plasma could not exceed a certain density without becoming unstable. This upper limit — known as the Greenwald limit — has been a major obstacle for fusion research, particularly for tokamak-type devices.\n\nIn a paper published on 1 January in Science Advances1, scientists working on China’s EAST device reported pushing plasma densities beyond this limit, achieving densities 30% to 65% higher than those normally reached by EAST.\n\n“These results are very promising and should be explored in other tokamak devices,” says Jeronimo Olaya, a fusion plasma physicist at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission in Saint-Paul-lez-Durance.\n\nFewer impurities\n\nIn 2021, study co-author Dominique Escande, a plasma physicist at the Aix-Marseille University in France, and colleagues first proposed2 that the Greenwald limit could be surpassed by adjusting the conditions so that the plasma and the inner wall of the reactor are in a stable, mutually reinforcing state.\n\nThe EAST team used high power microwaves to raise the temperature of the initial fuel used to generate the plasma in a more efficient way than those used in conventional methods. This reduced the number of metal atoms that were knocked off the tokamak’s inner walls and mixed into the plasma. Fewer impurities mean less unwanted radiation, helping the plasma to remain stable even as its density increases.\n\nThe researchers also injected a high amount of neutral gas into the chamber. This provided more fuel for the plasma to reach high densities later in the experiment, while simultaneously cooling the region near the walls and further reducing the production of impurities.",

      "summary": "Scientists in South Korea have discovered a way to make all-solid-state batteries safer and more powerful using inexpensive materials. Instead of adding costly metals, they redesigned the battery’s internal structure to help lithium ions move faster. This simple structural tweak boosted performance by up to four times. The work points to cheaper, safer batteries for phones, electric vehicles, and beyond.",
      "content": "Batteries play a critical role in everyday life, from powering smartphones to enabling electric vehicles. Despite their importance, today's batteries still come with major drawbacks, including high costs and the risk of fires or explosions. All-solid-state batteries have long been viewed as a safer alternative, but progress has been slowed by the challenge of balancing safety, performance, and affordability. Now, a research team in South Korea has shown that battery performance can be significantly improved through smart structural design alone, without relying on expensive metals.\n\nOn January 7th, KAIST announced a breakthrough by a research team led by Professor Dong-Hwa Seo from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. The project brought together researchers led by Professor Sung-Kyun Jung (Seoul National University), Professor Youn-Suk Jung (Yonsei University), and Professor Kyung-Wan Nam (Dongguk University). Together, they developed a new design approach for key all-solid-state battery materials that uses inexpensive raw ingredients while maintaining strong performance and a lower risk of fire or explosion.\n\nWhy Solid Electrolytes Are Safer but Harder to Optimize\n\nTraditional lithium-ion batteries depend on a liquid electrolyte that allows lithium ions to move between electrodes. All-solid-state batteries replace this liquid with a solid electrolyte, which greatly improves safety. However, lithium ions move more slowly through solids, and past efforts to speed them up often depended on costly metals or complicated manufacturing techniques.\n\nUsing Crystal Chemistry to Speed Up Lithium Movement\n\nTo solve this problem, the researchers focused on improving how lithium ions travel through solid electrolytes. Their strategy centered on the use of \"divalent anions\" such as oxygen and sulfur . These elements influence the crystal structure of the electrolyte by becoming part of its fundamental framework, which can change how ions move inside the material.\n\nThe team applied this idea to low-cost zirconium (Zr)-based halide solid electrolytes. By carefully introducing divalent anions, they were able to precisely adjust the internal structure of the material. This approach, known as the \"Framework Regulation Mechanism,\" expands the pathways available to lithium ions and reduces the energy needed for them to move. As a result, lithium ions can travel more quickly and efficiently through the solid material.\n\nAdvanced Tools Confirm Structural Improvements\n\nTo confirm that these structural changes worked as intended, the researchers relied on a range of advanced analytical methods, including:\n\nHigh-energy Synchrontron X-ray diffraction(Synchrotron XRD)\n\nPair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis\n\nX-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS)\n\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) modeling for electronic structure and diffusion\n\nThese techniques allowed the team to closely examine how the crystal structure changed and how those changes affected lithium-ion movement.\n\nPerformance Gains Using Inexpensive Materials\n\nTests showed that adding oxygen or sulfur to the electrolyte increased lithium-ion mobility by two to four times compared with conventional zirconium-based electrolytes. This improvement indicates that solid-state batteries can reach performance levels suitable for real-world use without relying on expensive materials.\n\nAt room temperature, the oxygen-doped electrolyte achieved an ionic conductivity of about 1.78 mS/cm, while the sulfur-doped version reached approximately 1.01 mS/cm. Ionic conductivity measures how easily lithium ions move through a material, and values above 1 mS/cm are generally considered adequate for practical battery applications at room temperature.\n\nShifting Battery Innovation Toward Smarter Design\n\nProfessor Dong-Hwa Seo explained the broader significance of the work, saying, \"Through this research, we have presented a design principle that can simultaneously improve the cost and performance of all-solid-state batteries using cheap raw materials. Its potential for industrial application is very high.\" Lead author Jae-Seung Kim emphasized that the study highlights a shift in battery research, moving attention away from simply choosing new materials and toward designing better structures.\n\nPublication and Research Support\n\nThe study, led by co-first authors Jae-Seung Kim (KAIST) and Da-Seul Han (Dongguk University), was published in the international journal Nature Communications on November 27, 2025.\n\nFunding for the research was provided by the Samsung Electronics Future Technology Promotion Center, the National Research Foundation of Korea, and the National Supercomputing Center.",

      "content": "Calculations show that injecting randomness into a quantum neural network could help it determine properties of quantum objects that are otherwise fundamentally hard to access\n\nQuantum computers could benefit from a path around the Heisenberg uncertainty principle Marijan Murat/dpa/Alamy\n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle puts a limit on how precisely we can measure certain properties of quantum objects. But researchers may have found a way to bypass this limitation using a quantum version of a neural network.\n\nGiven, for example, a chemically useful molecule, how can you predict what properties it might have in an hour or tomorrow? To make such predictions, researchers start by measuring its current properties. But for quantum objects, including some molecules, this can be unexpectedly difficult because each measurement can interfere with or change the outcome of the next measurement. Notably, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that some quantum properties of objects simply cannot be precisely measured simultaneously. For example, if you measure a quantum particle’s momentum extremely well, measuring its position will return only an approximate number.\n\nNow, Duanlu Zhou at the Chinese Academy of Science and his colleagues have mathematically proved that using quantum versions of a neural network may avoid some of these difficulties.\n\nZhou’s team explored the problem for practical reasons. When researchers run quantum computers, they need to know the properties of the computer’s building blocks, which are called qubits, either to assess and benchmark the device, or to use those qubits effectively when emulating an object like a molecule or a material. To determine a qubit’s properties, researchers typically apply some operations, similar to how you would apply “divide by 2” to determine whether a number is even. But the uncertainty principle means that some of these operations will be incompatible – equivalent to not being able to multiply a number by three then divide it by two and still have this calculation return a meaningful answer.\n\nThe researchers’ calculations now show that the incompatibility issue can be resolved if a quantum machine-learning algorithm – a quantum neural network (QNN) – is applied instead of simpler operations.\n\nImportantly, some steps in that algorithm must be randomly chosen from a predetermined set. Past studies have found that such randomness can make QNNs more effective in determining a single property of a quantum object, but Zhou and his colleagues expanded the idea to measuring several properties, including combinations of properties normally constrained by the uncertainty principle. They could do this because the results of many consecutive, random operations can be unravelled with special statistical methods to yield more precise outcomes than when just one operation is performed repeatedly.\n\nRobert Huang at the California Institute of Technology says that being able to measure many incompatible properties efficiently means scientists will be able to learn about a given quantum system much faster, which is important for applications of quantum computers in chemistry and materials science – as well as for understanding ever larger quantum computers themselves.\n\nThe new approach could plausibly be implemented in practice, but whether it is successful may depend on how useful it is compared with similar approaches that also leverage randomness to make informative quantum measurements, says Huang.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a rule in quantum physics that says we cannot measure certain properties of tiny particles, like their exact position and speed, at the same time. This makes it hard for scientists to understand quantum objects like molecules or the parts of quantum computers.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists led by Duanlu Zhou from the Chinese Academy of Science used math to show that a special kind of computer program called a quantum neural network (QNN) can get around this measurement problem. By adding some randomness to the program’s steps, the QNN can measure several quantum properties more precisely than before.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it helps scientists learn more about quantum systems faster. This can improve how quantum computers work and help in fields like chemistry and materials science, where knowing detailed quantum information is crucial. It could also make it easier to study bigger and more complex quantum computers.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will try to put this idea into practice and test if these quantum neural networks really work better than other methods that also use randomness. Their success will show if this approach can be used in real quantum computers and scientific experiments.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Adding randomness to quantum neural networks could help measure quantum particles more precisely, overcoming a long-standing physics limit and advancing quantum technology.",
