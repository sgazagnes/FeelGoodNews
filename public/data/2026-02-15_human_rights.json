      "content": "That was the central message of the Manama Declaration, issued at the close of the World Entrepreneurs and Investment Forum (WEIF) held this week in Bahrain.\n\nThe declaration places women at the heart of economic transformation, underscoring that empowering them within business and innovation ecosystems is essential to achieving inclusive and sustainable growth.\n\nIt also calls for strengthening women’s presence across emerging sectors, including the green, blue and orange economies which respectively promote environmental responsibility, sustainable use of ocean resources and creativity.\n\nOrganized by the UN Industrial Development Organization’s (UNIDO) Investment and Technology Promotion Office in Bahrain, the forum convened leaders, investors and entrepreneurs from around the world to shape a more resilient global economy and unlock new opportunities for women-led enterprises.\n\nAbdelmonem Makki Women entrepreneurs gather on stage at the International Woman Entrepreneurial Challenge 2026 in Manama, Bahrain.\n\n“An amazing opportunity”\n\nFor many participants, the forum delivered tangible results.\n\nDoris Martin, CEO of DMartin Consultancy in Bahrain, attended in search of meaningful collaboration and found it.\n\nThrough business-to-business (B2B) meetings facilitated during the event, she established partnerships with companies in the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.\n\n“This forum has been effective for me,” she told UN News. “I’ve had B2B collaboration with regional companies through Bahrain and through UNIDO.”\n\nTosin Arwejulo, CEO of Leadership Excel Consultancy and a Nigerian-American entrepreneur based in Bahrain, described the forum as a “powerful networking platform.”\n\n“I’ve had the opportunity to talk to people from literally every continent,” she said. “It has been an amazing opportunity to connect with like-minded leaders.”\n\nUN News/Abdelmonem Makki From left to right: Tosin

shared solutions\n\nThe forum’s impact extended beyond the Arab region.\n\nAyanthi Gurusinghe, President of the Ceylon Chamber of Women Entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka and representative of the South Asian Women Development Forum, attended alongside delegates from India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.\n\nShe said participants exchanged valuable lessons, particularly around access to finance, a challenge faced by women entrepreneurs across regions.\n\n“It was a good opportunity for networking, to come together, share views, learn and exchange experiences,” she said, expressing appreciation to UNIDO for creating a space where global connections could flourish.\n\nUN News/Abdelmonem Makki Ayanthi Gurusinghe, President of the Ceylon Chamber of Women Entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka and representative of the South Asian Women Development Forum, at WEIF 2026 in Bahrain.\n\nSpecial focus on artists with disabilities\n\nBeyond panel discussions and networking sessions, the forum also spotlighted inclusive entrepreneurship through three exhibitions including on “Determined Creative Entrepreneur.”\n\nAmong the exhibitors was Nisreen Samour of Micro Art Center in Bahrain, which specializes in training and developing artistic talent, with a special focus on artists with disabilities.\n\n“Today, we have about nine students participating, each specializing in an artistic field that aligns with their interests and abilities,” she said.\n\n“I personally train them, and we are currently working on developing their skills and empowering them to produce professional artwork that will help them effectively enter the art market and the job market, thus contributing to increased productivity and the center's overall performance” she told UN News.\n\nThe centre also works with orphans, helping them develop artistic skills and showcase their work publicly — fostering independence and self-reliance through creativity.\n\nUN News/Abdelmonem Makki Nisreen Samour of Micro Art Center in Bahrain, which specializes in training and developing artistic talent, with a special focus on artists with disabilities.\n\nThe role of academia\n\nOne recurring theme was the role of higher education in preparing young women to enter the world of entrepreneurship.\n\nIn an interview with UN News, Dr. Nihal Al-Najjar, professor at the Royal University for Women in Bahrain, highlighted the need to embed entrepreneurship deeply within academic systems.\n\n“Our academic role is to integrate entrepreneurship not just as a subject, but as a methodology,” she said, explaining that experiential learning and practical application are key. “We encourage students to think, innovate and identify gaps in society, and then work to find solutions.”\n\nShe added that universities must go beyond classroom teaching by connecting students to the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem, guiding them towards mentorship, funding opportunities and professional networks when they are ready to launch their own ventures.\n\nUN News/Abdelmonem Makki Dina Najar at WEIF2026 in Manama, Bahrain, covering Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nA driving force for sustainable development\n\nThe World Entrepreneurs and Investment Forum (WEIF) was preceded by the annual conference of the International Women Entrepreneurial Challenge (IWEC)—a New York-based NGO that helps women-owned businesses to grow.\n\nSpeaking at the conference, UNIDO Director General Gerd Müller described women’s entrepreneurship as a driving force for sustainable development, global innovation and economic inclusion.\n\n“We must ensure that women everywhere have a level playing field and are given the opportunity to unlock their full potential,” he stated, highlighting persistent barriers to finance, technology, and higher-skilled roles for women globally.\n\nReaffirming UNIDO’s commitment, he added that “empowering women is essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.” The 17 SDGs, adopted by governments in 2015, provide a blueprint for a more just and equitable future for all people and the planet.\n\nMr. Müller praised Bahrain’s leadership in supporting entrepreneurship and women’s economic participation and outlined UNIDO’s ongoing work in crisis-affected countries, noting, “UNIDO has just started working to set up recovery programmes in Syria, Sudan, and Palestine… mostly the women there are affected, and they need our support.”\n\nUNIDO ITPO Bahrain Gerd Müller, Director General of UNIDO, speaking at the International Woman Entrepreneurial Conference in Bahrain 2026.\n\nWomen as engines of business\n\nIn her opening remarks, IWEC Chair Ibukun Awosika highlighted women’s transformative role as engines of business, leadership, and national progress.\n\nShe emphasized that women constitute half of the world’s productive assets and, when empowered, become game changers in corporate and political leadership. Drawing on her own journey, Ms. Awosika recalled building a manufacturing group over 36 years before becoming the first and only woman chair of sub-Saharan Africa’s oldest financial institution, First Bank of Nigeria.\n\n“What women represent to the world is 50 per cent of its assets — productive, constructive assets that are game changers when fully deployed,” she said.\n\n“Every nation that has enough wisdom to invest and to actualize the talent that is in 50 per cent of its population is a country that is set to win.”\n\nUNIDO ITPO Bahrain H.E. Mrs. Ibukun Awo, IWECC Chair, speaking at WEIF2026 in Bahrain.\n\nSuccess Stories from Bahrain and Nigeria\n\nAccording to its website, the International Women Entrepreneurial Challenge (IWEC) has recognized 575 distinguished awardees globally, honoured annually at its conferences and nominated by partner organizations, representing women-owned businesses from across the world.\n\nIn Bahrain, IWEC recognized a new cohort of awardees from the Middle East and Africa.\n\nAmong them was Sonia Mohamed Janahi, founder of Maya La Chocolaterie, who highlighted UNIDO’s role in advancing women’s entrepreneurship.\n\nWith UNIDO’s support, Janahi expanded her Bahraini chocolate brand into Africa, establishing a cocoa processing plant in Côte d’Ivoire, creating jobs, promoting ethical supply chains, and ensuring global recognition for African-produced chocolate.\n\nAbdelmonem Makki Official event photo from WEIF2026 in Manama, Bahrain.\n\n“UNIDO has played a very vital role in my progression. They have taken my project and opened opportunities for me,” she told UN News, underscoring UNIDO’s commitment to recognizing women entrepreneurs across Bahrain, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\n“This event represents women globally and investments over $6 billion that bring women globally together. It awards women who have not just started a business but have sustained a business and scaled up a business and have had an impact on the economy and on the society.”\n\nAlso honoured was Nigerian entrepreneur Oluwakelemi, who discussed her gifting and lifestyle retail business, which employs women and supports household incomes across Nigeria while preparing to expand internationally.\n\n“I am passionate about building scalable African businesses with global reach,” she told UN News. “Not less than 5,000 people have been able to benefit from our business, from our work.”",

      "summary": "Calling for sweeping reforms of global institutions, UN Secretary-General António Guterres told African leaders on Saturday that the absence of permanent African seats on the Security Council is “indefensible,” declaring: “This is 2026 – not 1946.”",
      "content": "In a world marked by division and mistrust, he said, the African Union (AU) stands as a “flagship for multilateralism,” as he addressed the 39th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa.\n\nMr. Guterres praised Africa’s global leadership in “the struggle for justice and equality,” noting that the UN-AU partnership is stronger than ever, built on “respect, constant dialogue and unwavering solidarity.”\n\nCooperation has reached “new heights” over the past decade, he added, pointing to joint frameworks on peace and security, sustainable development and human rights.\n\nTweet URL\n\nPeace in Africa\n\nThe Secretary-General outlined three priorities for deeper cooperation: peace, economic action and climate justice.\n\nOn peace, he called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sudan, renewed dialogue in South Sudan, and respect for the territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Across the Sahel, Libya and the Horn of Africa, he stressed the need for African-led political solutions backed by sustained international support.\n\nEconomic action\n\nMr. Guterres further warned that developing countries face a $4 trillion annual Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) financing gap, while Africa loses more to debt servicing and illicit financial flows than it receives in aid.\n\nAt a press conference following the summit, he said it is “simply unconscionable” that Africa must contend with “an economic and financial system that remains totally unjust.”\n\nHe called for tripling the lending capacity of multilateral development banks and ensuring developing countries have “a real voice and a meaningful participation” in international financial institutions.\n\nNo more plundering\n\nHe also stressed that African countries must benefit directly from their natural wealth: “No more exploitation. No more plundering. The people of Africa must benefit from the resources of Africa.”\n\nHe urged that African countries benefit “first and fully from their critical minerals through fair, sustainable value chains and manufacturing,” in line with UN recommendations.\n\nClimate justice\n\nOn climate, Mr. Guterres warned that “the science is unequivocal – the planet will overshoot the 1.5 degree Celsius limit.” The 1.5°C threshold, enshrined in the Paris Agreement, is considered critical to avoiding the most catastrophic and irreversible climate impacts.\n\n“Africa did not cause the climate crisis,” he said, yet it faces faster-than-average warming, droughts, floods and deadly heat – “climate injustice – plain and simple.”\n\nHe called on developed countries to triple adaptation finance, mobilize $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries by 2035, and scale up the Loss and Damage Fund.\n\nReforms now\n\nMr. Guterres also underscored the urgent need for reforming global institutions.\n\nThe absence of permanent African seats on the Council is “indefensible; this is 2026 – not 1946,” he said, adding: “Whenever decisions about Africa and the world are on the table, Africa must be at the table.”",

His speech signals a call for fairness and respect for Africa’s rights and resources.\n\n**What’s next step** – The African Union and the UN will likely work together to push for changes in international organizations, including increasing Africa’s representation in decision-making bodies.

Il a déclaré qu’il est injuste que l’Afrique ne dispose pas de sièges permanents au Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU, affirmant : « Nous sommes en 2026 – pas en 1946. » Il a salué l’Union africaine pour son leadership dans la paix, la justice et la coopération avec l’ONU. Guterres a mis en avant trois domaines principaux pour un partenariat renforcé : la paix, l’équité économique et la justice climatique.\n\n**Impact** – Ce message est important car il demande que l’Afrique ait une voix plus forte dans les décisions mondiales qui affectent ses populations. Guterres a souligné la nécessité de mettre fin aux conflits au Soudan et au Soudan du Sud, d’améliorer le soutien économique en comblant un déficit de financement de 4 000 milliards de dollars pour le développement, et de faire face aux impacts du changement climatique qui touchent l’Afrique de façon disproportionnée, alors que le continent est le moins responsable. Son discours appelle à la justice et au respect des droits et ressources de l’Afrique.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – L’Union africaine et l’ONU vont probablement collaborer pour promouvoir des changements dans les organisations internationales, notamment pour augmenter la représentation de l’Afrique dans les instances décisionnelles. Des efforts seront également faits pour améliorer les négociations de paix, le soutien économique et accroître les financements pour aider l’Afrique à s’adapter au changement climatique.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – L’appel du Secrétaire général de l’ONU souligne la nécessité pour l’Afrique d’avoir un rôle plus fort et plus juste dans les décisions mondiales sur la paix, l’économie et le climat.\n",
