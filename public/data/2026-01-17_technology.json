Credit: NASA/Brandon Torres Navarette\n\nThrough a drone flight test at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley, researchers tested a blockchain-based system for protecting flight data. The system aims to keep air traffic management safe from disruption and protect data transferred between aircraft and ground stations from being intercepted or manipulated.\n\nFor aviation and airspace operations to remain safe, users need to be able to trust that data is reliable and transparent. While current systems have been able to protect flight data systems, cyberthreats continue to evolve, requiring new approaches. NASA researchers found the blockchain-based system can safely transmit and store information in real time.\n\nBlockchain operates like a decentralized database — it does not rely on a single computer or centralized system. Instead, it shares information across a vast network, recording and verifying every change to a dataset. The system ensures the data stays safe, accurate, and trustworthy.\n\nPrevious cybersecurity research focused on implementing a layered security architecture — using multiple physical and digital security measures to control system access. For this test, researchers took a different approach using blockchain to address potential threats.\n\nUsing drones allowed the team to show that the blockchain framework could yield benefits across several priority areas in aviation development, including autonomous air traffic management, urban air mobility, and high-altitude aircraft.\n\nTerrence D. Lewis (left), Kale Dunlap (center), and Aidan Jones monitor the flow of telemetry from both actual and simulated flights, ensuring the simulation and blockchain systems are processing and recording data accurately. Credit: NASA/Brandon Torres Navarette\n\nThis NASA research explored how blockchain can secure digital transactions between multiple systems and operators. The team used an open-source blockchain framework that allows trusted users real-time sharing and storage of critical data like aircraft operator registration information, flight plans, and telemetry. This framework restricts access to this data to trusted parties and approved users only.\n\nTo further examine system resilience, the team introduced a set of cybersecurity tests designed to assess, improve, and reinforce security during operations in airspace environments. During an August flight at Ames, the team demonstrated these capabilities using an Alta-X drone with a custom-built software and hardware package that included a computer, radio, GPS system, and battery.\n\nThe test simulated an environment with a drone flying in real-world conditions, complete with a separate ground control station and the blockchain and security infrastructure. The underlying blockchain framework and cybersecurity protocols can be extended to support high-altitude operations at 60,000 feet and higher and Urban Air Mobility operations, paving the way for a more secure, scalable, and trusted ecosystem.\n\nNASA researchers will continue to look at the data gathered during the test and apply what they’ve learned to future work. The testing will ultimately benefit U.S. aviation stakeholders looking for new tools to improve operations.\n\nThrough its Air Traffic Management and Safety project, NASA performed research to transform air traffic management systems to safely accommodate the growing demand of new air vehicles. The project falls under NASA’s Airspace Operations and Safety Program, a part the agency’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate that works to enable safe, efficient aviation transportation operations that benefit the flying public and industry.",

      "content": "Professional mathematicians have been stunned by the progress amateurs have made in solving long-standing problems with the assistance of AI tools, and say it could lead to a new way of doing mathematics\n\nAI tools are helping to decipher long-standing maths problems andresr/Getty Images\n\nAmateur mathematicians are using artificial intelligence chatbots to solve long-standing problems, in a move that has taken professionals by surprise. While the problems in question aren’t the most advanced in the mathematical canon, the success of AI models in tackling them shows that their mathematical performance has passed a significant threshold, say researchers, and could fundamentally change the way we do mathematics.\n\nThe questions being solved by AI originate from Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős, who was famous for his ability to pose useful but difficult questions during a career that spanned over six decades. “The questions tended to be very simple, but very hard,” says Thomas Bloom at the University of Manchester, UK.\n\nBy his death in 1996, there were more than 1000 of these unsolved Erdős problems, spanning a wide range of mathematical disciplines, from combinatorics (the study of combinations) to number theory. Today, they are seen as signposts for progress in these fields, says Bloom, who runs a website that catalogues the problems and tracks mathematicians’ progress in solving them.\n\nBecause Erdős problems are often simple to state, mathematicians began experimenting with feeding them to AI tools like ChatGPT. Bloom says that in October last year, he began seeing people use AI models to find relevant references in the mathematical literature that helped with their solutions.\n\nSoon after, AI tools began finding partial improvements to results, some of which had been found in past papers, while others appeared new.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Daily The latest on what’s new in science and why it matters each day. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“I was surprised then,” says Bloom. “Before, when I tried ChatGPT, it just made up papers, completely hallucinating, and so I had given up using it. But clearly, there was some sort of change around October. I actually found genuine papers because it had read them all, and often in a non-trivial way.”\n\nInspired by this progress, Kevin Barreto, an undergraduate mathematics student at Cambridge University, and Liam Price, an amateur mathematician, began looking for simple and understudied Erdős problems that they might solve with AI. After finding one such problem, number 728, a conjecture in number theory, they fed it to ChatGPT-5.2 Pro to solve it.\n\n“I looked at the statement, and thought, ‘This one might be able to get solved by ChatGPT, so let’s try it,’” says Barreto. “Sure enough, it comes back with an argument that’s quite nice and that a lot of people would actually agree was rather sophisticated.”\n\nAfter ChatGPT produced a proof, Barreto and Price used another AI tool called Aristotle, created by the AI company Harmonic, to verify their work. Aristotle converts the conventional language proof into one written in Lean, a mathematical programming language. It can then be instantly checked by a computer for correctness. This is an important step, says Bloom, as it saves the limited time that researchers have to check whether a result is correct or not.\n\nAs of mid-January, six Erdős problems have been fully solved by AI tools, though subsequent scrutiny by professional mathematicians revealed that five of these problems had previously been solved in the mathematical literature. Only one problem, number 205, has been fully solved by Barreto and Price with no pre-existing solution. AI tools have also enabled small improvements and partial solutions to seven other problems that don’t appear to be pre-existing in the literature.\n\nAs a result, there is an ongoing debate about whether these tools are really proving new ideas, or merely digging out old and forgotten solutions. Bloom points out that the AI models often have to translate the problems into new forms, and are discovering papers that make no mention of Erdős. “A lot of these papers, I wouldn’t have found, and maybe nobody would have found for a lot longer without this sort of [use of] the AI tool,” he says.\n\nAnother question is just how far this approach can go. All of these problems aren’t the most demanding in mathematics, and could perhaps be accomplished by a first-year PhD student, but that is still impressive, says Bloom. “To me, it’s incredible that AI is capable of that, because this takes non-trivial effort.”\n\nBarreto also says that the problems being solved are relatively straightforward, even when compared with more difficult Erdős problems, which current AI models fall short of solving. “Once [AI] gets through the low-hanging fruit problems, a lot of them are going to need more capable models,” he says. Some of the hardest problems have prize money set aside for anyone who can solve them, but Barreto thinks that is unlikely to happen soon: “Some people are trying to do bounty problems, and to me that’s kind of nuts. I don’t think the models are there yet.”\n\nSolving Erdős problems using AI is promising progress, says Kevin Buzzard at Imperial College London, but because most of the problems it is solving are either relatively straightforward or have had little attention, it makes it hard to gauge whether it is a significant achievement – or something that should concern professionals. “That is progress, but mathematicians aren’t going to be looking over their shoulders just yet,” says Buzzard. “It’s green shoots.”\n\nBut even if the models’ capability stays static, their ability to handle relatively complex mathematics could fundamentally change how researchers research and write proofs, says Bloom, because it will allow mathematicians who have limited knowledge of areas outside their particular discipline to draw on other fields.\n\n“Almost nobody knows every part of math, and that means that we’re quite limited in the sets of tools that we can use,” says Bloom. “The fact that you can just get an answer instantly, without having to bother another human, without having to waste months learning potentially useless knowledge, opens up so many connections. That’s going to be a huge change that we’ll see, just increasing the breadth of research that’s done.”\n\nThis could also allow mathematicians to practice an entirely new way of working, says Terence Tao at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has helped validate some of the AI-assisted Erdős problem solutions.\n\nMathematicians often focus on a small number of difficult problems because of limited time, while many less difficult but still important problems don’t get much attention. If AI tools can be applied to them all at once, it could lead to a more empirical, scientific way of doing mathematics, says Tao, where different ways of solving a problem could be tested on a large scale.\n\n“We are just so resource-limited by how much expert attention we have, that we don’t look at 99 per cent of all the problems that we could be studying,” says Tao. “So we don’t do things like survey hundreds of problems, trying to find one or two really interesting ones, or do statistical studies like, we have two different methods, which one is better?\n\n“This is a type of mathematics that just isn’t done,” he says. “We don’t do large-scale mathematics because we don’t have the intellectual resources, but AI is showing that you can.”",

      "content": "Understanding a molecule that plays a key role in nitrogen fixing – a chemical process that enables life on Earth – has long been thought of as problem for quantum computers, but now a classical computer may have solved it\n\nDo quantum computers offer a way to vastly improve agriculture?\n\nAs quantum computers continue to advance, identifying problems they can solve faster than the world’s best conventional computers is becoming increasingly important – but it turns out that a key task held up as a future goal by quantum proponents may not need a quantum computer at all.\n\nThe task in question involves a molecule called FeMoco, which plays a vital role in making life on Earth possible. That is because it is part of the process of nitrogen fixation, in which microbes convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, making it biologically accessible to most other living organisms. How exactly FeMoco works during this process is complicated and not fully understood, but if we could crack it and replicate it on an industrial scale, it could drastically cut the energy involved in producing fertilisers, potentially leading to a boost in crop yields.\n\nOne key aspect of understanding FeMoco is determining its lowest, or “ground-state”, energy, which involves accounting for the behaviour of its many electrons. But electrons are quantum particles that can behave in wave-like ways and occupy many different regions called orbitals. This level of complexity – with many electrons in many orbitals – is why computing lots of FeMoco’s properties has, so far, been intractable with conventional computers.\n\nResearchers have had some success using approximation methods, but the accuracy of their energy estimates remained limited. On the other hand, mathematical investigations have rigorously proven that quantum computers, which encode this complexity in a fundamentally different manner, could solve the problem without approximations – a well-established example of so-called quantum advantage.\n\nBut now, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan at the California Institute of Technology and his colleagues have found a conventional computing method that seems to be able to reach the same accuracy as a quantum one. The key metric has been the idea of “chemical accuracy”, or the minimal accuracy required to make realistic predictions for chemical processes. Based on their computations, Chan and his colleagues argue that conventional supercomputers can calculate FeMoco’s ground-state energy to that accuracy too.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Daily The latest on what’s new in science and why it matters each day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nFeMoco has many quantum states, each of which has its own energy, and they are arranged on something like a ladder with the ground state at the very bottom. To make reaching that bottom rung more amenable to classical computer algorithms, the researchers focused on what we know about states that sit on nearby rungs and what their properties imply about what can exist a step or two below. This included, for example, insights about symmetries of electrons’ quantum states.\n\nUltimately, the simplification allowed the researchers to use classical algorithms to calculate upper bounds for FeMoco’s ground-state energy, then mathematically extrapolate them to an energy value with an uncertainty that matches chemical accuracy. In other words, their final answer for what the molecule’s lowest energy can be ought to be precise enough to use in future studies.\n\nThe researchers also estimated that the supercomputer method may even be faster than quantum ones, performing calculations in less than a minute that would take 8 hours on a quantum device – although this estimate assumes an ideal supercomputer performance.\n\nSo, does that mean we will soon understand FeMoco well enough to boost agriculture? Not quite – there are still many unanswered questions about, for instance, which parts of the molecule interact with nitrogen the most or what molecules may be produced as intermediate steps in the nitrogen-fixation process.\n\n“The work doesn’t really tell us much about the FeMoco system in terms of its function, but as a model to show quantum advantage, it does place the bar even higher for quantum approaches,” says David Reichmann at Columbia University in New York.\n\nDominic Berry at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, points out that while the team’s work shows that classical computers can attack the FeMoco problem, they are still only capable of approximation, while quantum methods guarantee that the problem can be solved in full.\n\n“This does challenge the argument for using quantum computers for problems like this, but for more complicated systems, it is expected that the computation time for classical methods will increase much faster than that for quantum algorithms,” he says.\n\nAnother issue is that quantum computers are still improving. Existing quantum computers are all too small and error-prone to tackle problems like FeMoco’s ground-state energy, but a new generation of fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are able to correct their own errors, is expected soon. In practical terms, they may still be the best way to understand FeMoco and related molecules, says Berry. “Quantum computing should enable these systems to be solved far more generally, making it a routine calculation when fault-tolerant quantum computers are available.”",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Los científicos han estudiado durante mucho tiempo una molécula llamada FeMoco, que ayuda a los microbios a convertir el nitrógeno del aire en una forma que las plantas pueden usar. Este proceso, llamado fijación del nitrógeno, es esencial para el crecimiento de los cultivos y la vida. Entender el comportamiento exacto de FeMoco es muy difícil porque involucra muchas partículas pequeñas llamadas electrones que actúan de manera complicada.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Un equipo de investigadores del Instituto de Tecnología de California (Caltech) encontró una forma de usar superordenadores clásicos potentes para calcular con precisión la energía de los electrones de FeMoco. Antes, muchos pensaban que solo las computadoras cuánticas, máquinas especiales diseñadas para manejar problemas cuánticos, podían hacerlo. El nuevo método usa matemáticas inteligentes y conocimientos sobre los patrones de electrones de la molécula para simplificar los cálculos.\n\n**Impacto** – Este descubrimiento muestra que las computadoras clásicas pueden manejar este problema complejo tan bien como las cuánticas, y posiblemente más rápido. Desafía la idea de que las computadoras cuánticas siempre son necesarias para ciertas tareas científicas. Dado que entender mejor FeMoco podría ayudar a hacer la producción de fertilizantes más eficiente en energía y mejorar la agricultura, este avance podría acelerar la investigación en esos campos.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Aunque este método encuentra la energía de FeMoco con gran precisión, los científicos aún necesitan aprender más sobre cómo funciona exactamente la molécula en la fijación del nitrógeno. Mientras tanto, las computadoras cuánticas siguen desarrollándose y podrían resolver problemas aún más complejos que las clásicas no pueden manejar fácilmente. Los investigadores seguirán explorando ambos enfoques.\n\n**Frase clave** – Computadoras clásicas potentes han igualado a las cuánticas en resolver un enigma molecular clave para la agricultura, abriendo nuevos caminos para la investigación científica y mejoras en el cultivo.",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 16 January 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00164-0Chinese factories have embraced the machines, but many activities still require human operators.",
      "content": "Humanoid robots are being trialed in car manufacturing.Credit: VCG/Getty\n\nHumanoid robots are on the brink of being commercially useful, say Chinese and US firms that have announced plans to produce them at scale in the past three months.\n\nMany researchers agree that there has been a step change in humanoid capability over the past five years, owing to cheaper parts as well as innovations such as improved battery power and artificial-intelligence algorithms, which allow for better perception and autonomy.\n\nIn November, Chinese firm UBTECH announced that it had made “the world’s first mass delivery of humanoid robots”. More than 1,000 of its Walker S2 model humanoids were sent to factories in 2025, says Yu Zheng, a roboticist and vice-dean of the UBTECH Research Institute in Shenzhen. The silver-white humanoid can walk autonomously and stably, as well as grab and move objects, but deployment “is still at an early stage”, says Zheng.\n\nWhether humanoids are saving companies time or money remains to be seen. Battery time is limited to hours and many activities still require human operators, who use the robots as puppets to complete tasks while gathering data for future iterations. Other researchers caution that technical and safety limitations mean that humanoids are far from ready for general-purpose use in homes and offices.\n\n“They can do maybe one or two things autonomously, or semi-autonomously,” says Esyin Chew, a roboticist at Cardiff Metropolitan University in the United Kingdom, who is overseeing a project involving trialling more than 80 robots in service and health-care settings. “But they cannot react to real-world problems like our human brains,” she says.\n\nThe AI revolution is coming to robots: how will it change them?\n\nWhy, robot?\n\nScience fiction has long fuelled the idea that robots will ultimately come in human form, despite the body type being inherently complex and unstable compared with the static or quadruped robots already used in industry, says Oskar Palinko, a roboticist at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense. “A humanoid will fall over if it loses power,” he says.\n\nBut humanoids have the advantage of functioning in environments people have created. This in theory could make a humanoid a “universal tool” that could do the job of multiple other types of machines, says Palinko.\n\nHumanoids are much closer to this dream than a decade ago, he says, thanks to denser batteries that fuel bots for hours rather than minutes, cheaper and more precise actuators (that convert electricity to movement) and AI learning algorithms in robot control systems. Developers are increasingly making use of generative models that enable robots to 'reason' and make sense of the world, as well as imbue them with the ability to learn tasks for which they are not pre-programmed.\n\nCar makers\n\nHumanoids first application could be in car factories. Some US robotics developers, including Boston Dynamics and Tesla, are running pilots of humanoid robots in their parent company's industrial plants. The automotive industry is “an ideal setting” in which to apply humanoids, says Carolina Parada, based in Boulder, Colorado, who leads the robotics team at Google DeepMind, which last week announced a partnership with Boston Dynamics. Their factories host diverse and complex tasks and “in a semi-structured environment that is built for robots”, she says.\n\nCompanies are pinning their hopes on robots learning on the job. When a UBTECH Walker S2 fails while working autonomously, a backup remote operator takes over, completing the task, says Zheng. This process gathers data to improve future functionality he says. UBTECH and Boston Dynamics are applying the same technique in vast data-collection centres, in which humans remotely operate humanoid robots to teach them to perform a range of tasks.\n\nRobots demonstrate principles of collective intelligence\n\nAlthough China and the United States are leading the way in humanoid development, China seems particularly poised to embrace the robots. Factories in the country are willing to let UBTECH test out and improve their robots, says Zheng. \"Currently the efficiency and productivity of a humanoid robot may not match those of a human worker, and our customers know that well,\" adds a UBTECH spokesperson. \"They see it as the beginning.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Humanoid robots are machines designed to look and move like humans. For many years, they were mostly a dream because they are hard to build and control. Recently, better batteries, smarter computer programs, and cheaper parts have made these robots much more capable.\n\n**What happened** – In 2025, a Chinese company called UBTECH sent over 1,000 humanoid robots named Walker S2 to factories for real work. These robots can walk on their own, pick up things, and help with tasks. In the US, companies like Boston Dynamics and Tesla are also testing humanoid robots in car factories. However, the robots still need human help sometimes, especially when they get stuck or run out of battery.\n\n**Impact** – This is one of the first times humanoid robots have been used at such a large scale in real factories. Factories in China are open to testing and improving these robots, which shows trust in the technology’s future. Although the robots can only do a few tasks by themselves now, they are learning and getting better. Using humanoid robots could eventually save time and help with difficult or repetitive jobs in factories.\n\n**What's next step** – Robots will continue to learn from humans who control them remotely when needed. This helps improve their skills over time. Companies plan to make robots smarter and able to work longer without batteries running out. More tests in different factories will show how useful humanoid robots can become in the next few years.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Humanoid robots are starting to work alongside humans in factories, showing early signs of becoming useful helpers in industry.\n",
