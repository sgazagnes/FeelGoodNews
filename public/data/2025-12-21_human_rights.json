      "title": "How a failing Cambodia-Thailand ceasefire can illuminate the road to peace",
      "summary": "“Countries around the world have needed multiple ceasefire attempts before reaching a stable peace. Thailand and Cambodia may be no exception.”",
      "content": "This article by Duanghathai Buranajaroenkij was originally published by Peace News Network on November 24, 2025. An edited version is republished on Global Voices as part of a media partnership agreement.\n\nAccusations of ceasefire violations between Thailand and Cambodia in November 2025 have stirred public anger and revived fears on both sides that the situation may once again descend into conflict. As statements grow sharper and political pressure intensifies, some voices in politics suggest abandoning the agreement altogether. This sense of alarm is understandable, but it also reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what ceasefires are and how they function.\n\nRather than treating a breach as proof of failure, it is more accurate and more constructive to view it as an expected part of the peace process. Ceasefires rarely work perfectly the first time. Their fragility is not a sign that peace is impossible, but a reminder that peace must be built through persistence, learning, and patience.\n\nThe nature of ceasefires: Fragile, imperfect, and necessary\n\nGlobally, ceasefires almost always begin in intensely fragile environments. The parties may have agreed to pause violence, but the underlying conditions, distrust, fear, historical grievances, pressure from hard-line supporters, and volatile local dynamics still exist. In such an atmosphere, even a minor incident, whether intentional or accidental, can trigger renewed tension.\n\nYet this fragility does not mean the ceasefire is meaningless. It means it is alive. Ceasefires are not stable structures; they are temporary breathing spaces created in the midst of instability. Their purpose is not to eliminate risk, but to provide a foundation for managing risk together.\n\nWhen societies expect a ceasefire to operate flawlessly, any breach is interpreted as betrayal. But if we understand that fragility is normal, we respond more calmly and avoid escalating a situation that could otherwise be contained.\n\nWhat the research shows: Failure as a pathway to success\n\nThis understanding is strongly supported by global research. Jason Quinn and Madhav Joshi of the University of Notre Dame’s Kroc Institute studied 196 conflicts between 1975 and 2011. Their findings reveal a pattern that defies common assumptions. Multiple failed ceasefires precede most peace processes that ultimately succeed. These early collapses play a critical role: They expose weak points, clarify misunderstandings, and allow negotiators to refine communication and monitoring systems.\n\nOne of the strongest predictors of a durable ceasefire is not how well the first couple of attempts hold, but rather whether the parties had prior agreements, even if those agreements had collapsed. In other words, each failure becomes part of the learning curve that eventually stabilizes the process.\n\nWhen viewed through this lens, a ceasefire breach is not a catastrophe. It is part of the education of peace.\n\nLeadership in times of fragility\n\nMoments of ceasefire tension test leadership more than any other time. Responsible leaders must prevent panic and remind the public that such incidents are expected. They must also calm their own security forces, who may feel angered or threatened and are under pressure from “cheerleaders” who demand a harder line.\n\nGood leadership requires stepping forward to explain that early instability is typical and that recommitment, not retaliation, is what prevents escalation. Without such leadership, societies can easily be drawn into cycles of anger and confrontation, even when no one truly wants the conflict to flare up again.\n\nCeasefires create space for peace but do not guarantee it\n\nA ceasefire, by itself, cannot resolve the political and social grievances that fuel conflict. If underlying issues remain unaddressed, such as mistrust, unclear communication channels, insecure borders, or a lack of community engagement, then pressure will build beneath the surface. Expecting the ceasefire itself to deliver peace is unrealistic.\n\nInstead, we should see the ceasefire as one tool among many. It provides space for negotiators to work on deeper problems: political arrangements, economic needs, local security concerns, and mechanisms for preventing escalation. If these elements are not strengthened, even the best ceasefire will remain fragile.\n\nStarting again as many times as needed\n\nThe key to effective ceasefire management is accepting from the beginning that failure is likely. This mindset does not promote pessimism; it promotes resilience. When a breakdown occurs, the question should not be, “Is peace impossible?” but rather, “What does this teach us about what must be strengthened next?”\n\nCountries around the world have needed multiple ceasefire attempts before reaching a stable peace. Thailand and Cambodia may be no exception. What matters is not whether the ceasefire holds perfectly, but whether both sides remain committed to returning to dialogue after setbacks.\n\nA ceasefire may falter many times. It may cause frustration or disappointment. But it remains a crucial step toward peace, and each attempt brings the parties closer to understanding how to prevent violence more effectively.\n\nThe real failure is giving up\n\nA failing ceasefire does not mean the peace process has failed. It means the process is underway. What determines the future is not whether clashes occur, but how governments, militaries, and societies respond to them.\n\nIf we interpret every breach as a reason to abandon dialogue, then conflict will return. But if we view each incident as part of a long, complicated learning process, then we can respond with the patience and maturity needed to keep the journey moving forward.\n\nWe do not fail when a ceasefire breaks. We fail only when we decide that a few breaches are enough to give up on peace.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Thailand and Cambodia recently saw violations in their ceasefire agreement, raising fears that fighting might start again. Ceasefires are agreements to stop fighting, but they often happen in tense situations where trust is low and problems remain unresolved.\n\n**What happened** – In November 2025, both countries accused each other of breaking the ceasefire. These events caused anger and calls from some politicians to end the agreement. However, experts say such setbacks are normal and expected in peace processes.\n\n**Impact** – Research shows that many successful peace agreements have experienced several failed ceasefires first. These failures help reveal problems and improve communication, making future attempts stronger. Understanding this can help leaders and people stay calm and committed instead of giving up.\n\n**What's next step** – The focus now is on learning from these breaches and continuing talks. Good leadership is important to manage tensions and remind everyone that setbacks don’t mean the peace process is over.

      "summary": "“Access to technology should be a guaranteed right to the all Brazilian citizens. To have a cell phone doesn't make (anyone) less Indigenous.”",
      "content": "Back in August, Luciano Huck, a TV host who in the past has flirted with the idea of running for Brazil’s presidency, went to shoot an episode of his Sunday show at the Parque Indígena do Xingu (Xingu Indigenous Park), one of the main Indigenous reserves and the first Indigenous land demarcated by the federal government in the country.\n\nAlmost four months later, behind-the-scenes footage posted on Instagram showing him sitting next to singer Anitta went viral across social media, sparking backlash and highlighting issues with non-Indigenous people’s perceptions of native communities.\n\nIn the video, which lasts around a minute and 20 seconds, as people take pictures and prepare to record, you can see some Indigenous individuals holding mobile phones to capture the moment. One of them, posing in front of the host, also has his own telephone in his hand. Huck calls them out — “Cell phone!” — and asks for those wearing “non-traditional clothes” to step away. He then proceeds: “Yep, clean up your culture there,” explaining further:\n\nÉ o seguinte, a gente está cheio de câmera. Quanto mais celular de vocês aparece, eu acho que menos é a cultura de vocês. Quanto mais a gente conseguir preservar as nossas cenas, sem celular…Porque assim, quando aparece celular, mexe na cultura originária. Quando a gente estiver gravando, se puder segurar o celular, eu acho que quem tiver que ver valoriza mais vocês. Se você puder falar isso para o povo é bom.\n\nHere is the thing, we have lots of cameras here. The more cell phones from you show up, I guess is less of your culture. As much we can preserve our scenes without cell phones…Because when a cell phone is shown, it messes with original culture. When we are recording, if you can hold back with the phones, I think anyone who sees it will appreciate you more. If you can tell that to the people would be good.\n\nThe Indigenous man goes on to translate the message to his community.\n\nThe comments led Indigenous organizations in Brazil, such as Apib (Indigenous People of Brazil's Articulation) and other regional associations linked to it, to issue a joint statement shared on their Instagram pages.\n\nVer essa foto no Instagram Um post compartilhado por COIAB (@coiabamazonia)\n\nIndigenous cultures do not need to be “cleaned up.”\n\nOur presence is political, historical, current and does not fit into your anti-Indigenous racism.\n\nIn the statement, they note that Indigenous people do not exist solely for “pretty pictures,” as museum pieces answering to certain expectations, and that the phrase “cleaning up their culture” reinforces a mistaken and dangerous view of their peoples. In the caption they also wrote:\n\nO acesso à tecnologia deve ser um direito garantido a todos os cidadãos brasileiros. Possuir um celular não torna um parente menos indígena. A tecnologia e a internet têm sido fundamentais para os povos indígenas na luta por seus territórios, auxiliando no monitoramento e gestão ambiental, no acesso a oportunidades de educação e trabalho, na comunicação entre comunidades, organizações e o Estado, além de possibilitar denúncias de violações de direitos indígenas que foram historicamente invisibilizadas.\n\nAccess to technology should be a guaranteed right to all Brazilian citizens. Having a cell phone doesn’t make a relative (term used to refer to other Indigenous people) less Indigenous. Technology and the internet have been fundamental to Indigenous people in their fight for their territories, helping in monitoring them and with environmental management, accessing educational opportunities and work, in the communication between communities, organizations and the State, besides making possible to denounce Indigenous rights violations that were historically made invisible.\n\nApib republished the statement a few days later, expressing “indignation” over Huck's words. The image posted on their Instagram also says:\n\nPodemos usar o que vocês usam, sem deixar de ser quem somos.\n\nSer indígena nunca foi sobre negar o presente, mas sobre existir com dignidade em qualquer tempo até nas telas que insistem em nos enxergar errado.\n\nWe can use what you use without stopping being who we are.\n\nBeing Indigenous was never about denying the present, but about existing with dignity at any time even in screens that insist on seeing us wrongfully.\n\nAfter the backlash, Huck posted on his Instagram stories that he was misunderstood and highlighted his longstanding relationship with Indigenous people, as reported by news portal Terra:\n\nSobre a imagem em questão, registrada nos bastidores de uma gravação, é importante esclarecer: não se tratou de impor qualquer tipo de limitação cultural ou de consumo. Foi apenas uma decisão de direção de arte, um ajuste pontual dentro do contexto de um set de filmagem, nada além disso.\n\nAbout the image in question, taken behind the scenes during a shoot, it is important to clarify: it was not about imposing any kind of cultural or consumption limitation. It was just an art direction’s decision, a punctual adjustment within the context of a film set, nothing beyond that.\n\nLocated in the state of Mato Grosso, in the center-west region of Brazil and within the Legal Amazon region, with a territory of around 27,000 square kilometers (10.4 square miles), the Xingu Indigenous Park was recognized by a federal government decree in 1961. It was the first official Indigenous land demarcated in the country. The process, however, faced resistance from the local state government and the land was only established in 1978, as noted in a story by Brasil de Direitos.\n\nToday, Xingu’s Park is home to a population of 6,177 people from 16 Indigenous ethnicities, according to the Terras Indígenas do Brasil info page: Aweti, Ikpeng, Kalapalo, Kamaiurá, Kawaiwete, Kisêdjê, Kuikuro, Matipu, Mehinako, Nahukuá, Naruvotu, Tapayuna, Trumai, Waurá, Yawalapiti and Yudja. Its conservation is under federal government management.\n\nThe latest census, conducted by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) in 2022, found that the country now has an Indigenous population of 1,694,836 (less than 1 per cent of the total Brazilian population) and 391 ethnic groups; three out of four Indigenous individuals declared their ethnic group.\n\nTwo years after the Supreme Court ruled the proposal of a time marker for demarcation of Indigenous land as unconstitutional, the National Congress is trying to reverse the scenario in a vote that could happen this month. If the time marker is approved for insertion into the Constitution, Indigenous people would only have the right to claim lands they were occupying or under dispute at the time of the current Constitution, in October 1988.",
