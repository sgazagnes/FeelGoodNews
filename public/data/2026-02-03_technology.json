Stanford researchers created miniature optical cavities that efficiently collect light from individual atoms, allowing many qubits to be read at once. The team has already demonstrated working arrays with dozens and even hundreds of cavities. The approach could eventually support massive quantum networks with millions of qubits.",
      "content": "After years of slow progress, researchers may finally be seeing a clear path forward in the quest to build powerful quantum computers. These machines are expected to dramatically shorten the time required for certain calculations, turning problems that would take classical computers thousands of years into tasks that could be completed in hours.\n\nA team led by physicists at Stanford University has developed a new kind of optical cavity that can efficiently capture single photons, the basic particles of light, emitted by individual atoms. Those atoms serve as the core components of a quantum computer because they store qubits, which are the quantum equivalent of the zeros and ones used in traditional computing. For the first time, this approach allows information to be collected from all qubits at once.\n\nOptical Cavities Enable Faster Qubit Readout\n\nIn research published in Nature, the team describes a system made up of 40 optical cavities, each holding a single atom qubit, along with a larger prototype that contains more than 500 cavities. The results point to a realistic route toward building quantum computing networks that could one day include as many as a million qubits.\n\n\"If we want to make a quantum computer, we need to be able to read information out of the quantum bits very quickly,\" said Jon Simon, the study's senior author and associate professor of physics and of applied physics in Stanford's School of Humanities and Sciences. \"Until now, there hasn't been a practical way to do that at scale because atoms just don't emit light fast enough, and on top of that, they spew it out in all directions. An optical cavity can efficiently guide emitted light toward a particular direction, and now we've found a way to equip each atom in a quantum computer within its own individual cavity.\"\n\nHow Optical Cavities Control Light\n\nAn optical cavity works by trapping light between two or more reflective surfaces, causing it to bounce back and forth. The effect can be compared to standing between mirrors in a fun house, where reflections seem to stretch endlessly into the distance. In scientific settings, these cavities are far smaller and use repeated passes of a laser beam to extract information from atoms.\n\nAlthough optical cavities have been studied for decades, they have been difficult to use with atoms because atoms are extremely small and nearly transparent. Getting light to interact with them strongly enough has been a persistent challenge.\n\nA New Design Using Microlenses\n\nRather than relying on many repeated reflections, the Stanford team introduced microlenses inside each cavity to tightly focus light onto a single atom. Even with fewer light bounces, this method proved more effective at pulling quantum information from the atom.\n\n\"We have developed a new type of cavity architecture; it's not just two mirrors anymore,\" said Adam Shaw, a Stanford Science Fellow and first author on the study. \"We hope this will enable us to build dramatically faster, distributed quantum computers that can talk to each other with much faster data rates.\"\n\nBeyond the Binary Limits of Classical Computing\n\nConventional computers process information using bits that represent either zero or one. Quantum computers operate using qubits, which are based on the quantum states of tiny particles. A qubit can represent zero, one, or both states at the same time, allowing quantum systems to handle certain calculations far more efficiently than classical machines.\n\n\"A classical computer has to churn through possibilities one by one, looking for the correct answer,\" said Simon. \"But a quantum computer acts like noise-canceling headphones that compare combinations of answers, amplifying the right ones while muffling the wrong ones.\"\n\nScaling Toward Quantum Supercomputers\n\nScientists estimate that quantum computers will need millions of qubits to outperform today's most powerful supercomputers. According to Simon, reaching that level will likely require connecting many quantum computers into large networks. The parallel light-based interface demonstrated in this study provides an efficient foundation for scaling up to those sizes.\n\nThe researchers showed a working 40-cavity array in the current study, along with a proof-of-concept system containing more than 500 cavities. Their next goal is to expand to tens of thousands. Looking further ahead, the team envisions quantum data centers in which individual quantum computers are linked through cavity-based network interfaces to form full-scale quantum supercomputers.\n\nBroader Scientific and Technological Impact\n\nSignificant engineering hurdles remain, but the researchers believe the potential benefits are substantial. Large-scale quantum computers could lead to breakthroughs in materials design and chemical synthesis, including applications related to drug discovery, as well as advances in code breaking.\n\nThe ability to efficiently collect light also has implications beyond computing. Cavity arrays could improve biosensing and microscopy, supporting progress in medical and biological research. Quantum networks may even contribute to astronomy by enabling optical telescopes with enhanced resolution, potentially allowing scientists to directly observe planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system.\n\n\"As we understand more about how to manipulate light at a single particle level, I think it will transform our ability to see the world,\" Shaw said.\n\n​​Simon is also the Joan Reinhart Professor of Physics & Applied Physics. Shaw is also a Felix Bloch Fellow and an Urbanek-Chodorow Fellow.\n\nAdditional Stanford co-authors include David Schuster, the Joan Reinhart Professor of Applied Physics, and doctoral students Anna Soper, Danial Shadmany, and Da-Yeon Koh.\n\nOther co-authors include researchers from Stony Brook University, the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and Montana State University.\n\nThis research received support from the National Science Foundation, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Army Research Office, Hertz Foundation, and the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nMatt Jaffe of Montana State University and Simon act as consultants to and hold stock options in Atom Computing.

      "title": "Does AI already have human-level intelligence? The evidence is clear",
      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 02 February 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00285-6The vision of human-level machine intelligence laid out by Alan Turing in the 1950s is now a reality. Eyes unclouded by dread or hype will help us to prepare for what comes next.",
      "content": "In 1950, in a paper entitled ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’1, Alan Turing proposed his ‘imitation game’. Now known as the Turing test, it addressed a question that seemed purely hypothetical: could machines display the kind of flexible, general cognitive competence that is characteristic of human thought, such that they could pass themselves off as humans to unaware humans?\n\nThree-quarters of a century later, the answer looks like ‘yes’. In March 2025, the large language model (LLM) GPT-4.5, developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, was judged by humans in a Turing test to be human 73% of the time — more often than actual humans were2. Moreover, readers even preferred literary texts generated by LLMs over those written by human experts3.\n\nThis is far from all. LLMs have achieved gold-medal performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad, collaborated with leading mathematicians to prove theorems4, generated scientific hypotheses that have been validated in experiments5, solved problems from PhD exams, assisted professional programmers in writing code, composed poetry and much more — including chatting 24/7 with hundreds of millions of people around the world. In other words, LLMs have shown many signs of the sort of broad, flexible cognitive competence that was Turing’s focus — what we now call ‘general intelligence’, although Turing did not use the term.\n\nWhat is the future of intelligence? The answer could lie in the story of its evolution\n\nYet many experts baulk at saying that current AI models display artificial general intelligence (AGI) — and some doubt that they ever will. A March 2025 survey by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Washington DC found that 76% of leading researchers thought that scaling up current AI approaches would be ‘unlikely’ or ‘very unlikely’ to yield AGI (see go.nature.com/4smn16b).\n\nWhat explains this disconnect? We suggest that the problem is part conceptual, because definitions of AGI are ambiguous and inconsistent; part emotional, because AGI raises fear of displacement and disruption; and part practical, as the term is entangled with commercial interests that can distort assessments. Precisely because AGI dominates public discourse, it is worth engaging with the concept in a more detached way: as a question about intelligence, rather than a pressing concern about social upheaval or an ever-postponed milestone in a business contract.\n\nIn writing this Comment, we approached this question from different perspectives — philosophy, machine learning, linguistics and cognitive science — and reached a consensus after extensive discussion. In what follows, we set out why we think that, once you clear away certain confusions, and strive to make fair comparisons and avoid anthropocentric biases, the conclusion is straightforward: by reasonable standards, including Turing’s own, we have artificial systems that are generally intelligent. The long-standing problem of creating AGI has been solved. Recognizing this fact matters — for policy, for risk and for understanding the nature of mind and even the world itself.\n\nQuestions of definition\n\nWe assume, as we think Turing would have done, that humans have general intelligence. Some think that general intelligence does not exist at all, even in humans. Although this view is coherent and philosophically interesting, we set it aside here as being too disconnected from most AI discourse. But having made this assumption, how should we characterize general intelligence?\n\nA common informal definition of general intelligence, and the starting point of our discussions, is a system that can do almost all cognitive tasks that a human can do6,7. What tasks should be on that list engenders a lot of debate, but the phrase ‘a human’ also conceals a crucial ambiguity. Does it mean a top human expert for each task? Then no individual qualifies — Marie Curie won Nobel prizes in chemistry and physics but was not an expert in number theory. Does it mean a composite human with competence across the board? This, too, seems a high bar — Albert Einstein revolutionized physics, but he couldn’t speak Mandarin.\n\nHow close is AI to human-level intelligence?\n\nA definition that excludes essentially all humans is not a definition of general intelligence; it is about something else, perhaps ideal expertise or collective intelligence. Rather, general intelligence is about having sufficient breadth and depth of cognitive abilities, with ‘sufficient’ anchored by paradigm cases. Breadth means abilities across multiple domains — mathematics, language, science, practical reasoning, creative tasks — in contrast to ‘narrow’ intelligences, such as a calculator or a chess-playing program. Depth means strong performance within those domains, not merely superficial engagement.\n\nHuman general intelligence admits degrees and variation. Children, average adults and an acknowledged genius such as Einstein all have general intelligence of varying level and profile. Individual humans excel or fall short in different domains. The same flexibility should apply to artificial systems: we should ask whether they have the core cognitive abilities at levels comparable to human-level general intelligence.\n\nRather than stipulating a definition, we draw on both actual and hypothetical cases of general intelligence — from Einstein to aliens to oracles — to triangulate the contours of the concept and refine it more systematically. Our conclusion: insofar as individual humans have general intelligence, current LLMs do, too.\n\nWhat general intelligence isn’t\n\nWe can start by identifying four features that are not required for general intelligence.\n\nPerfection. We don’t expect a physicist to match Einstein’s insights, or a biologist to replicate Charles Darwin’s breakthroughs. Few, if any, humans have perfect depth even within specialist areas of competence. Human general intelligence does not require perfection; neither should AGI.\n\nUniversality. No individual human can do every cognitive task, and other species have abilities that exceed our own: an octopus can control its eight arms independently; many insects can see parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are invisible to humans. General intelligence does not require universal mastery of these skills; an AGI does not need perfect breadth.\n\nHuman similarity. Intelligence is a functional property that can be realized in different substrates — a point Turing embraced in 1950 by setting aside human biology1. Systems demonstrating general intelligence need not replicate human cognitive architecture or understand human cultural references. We would not demand these things of intelligent aliens; the same applies to machines.\n\nSuperintelligence. This is generally used to indicate any system that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in almost all areas. Superintelligence and AGI are often conflated, particularly in business contexts, in which ‘superintelligence’ often signals economic disruption. No human meets this standard; it should not be a requirement for AGI, either.\n\nA cascade of evidence\n\nWhat, then, is general intelligence? There is no ‘bright line’ test for its presence — any exact threshold is inevitably arbitrary. This might frustrate those who want exact criteria, but the vagueness is a feature, not a bug. Concepts such as ‘life’ and ‘health’ resist sharp definition yet remain useful; we recognize paradigm cases without needing exact boundaries. Humans are paradigm examples of general intelligence; a pocket calculator lacks it, despite superhuman ability at calculations.\n\nWhen we assess general intelligence or ability in other humans, we do not attempt to peer inside their heads to verify understanding — we infer it from behaviour, conversation and problem-solving. No single test is definitive, but evidence accumulates. The same applies to artificial systems.\n\nJust as we assess human general intelligence through progressively demanding tests, from basic literacy to PhD examinations, we can consider a cascade of increasingly demanding evidence that warrants progressively higher confidence in the presence of AGI.\n\nTuring-test level. Markers comparable to a basic school education: passing standard school exams, holding adequate conversations and performing simple reasoning. A decade ago, meeting these might have been widely accepted as sufficiently strong evidence for AGI.\n\nCurrent AIs are more broadly capable than the science-fiction supercomputer HAL 9000 was.Credit: Hethers/Shutterstock\n\nExpert level. Here, the demands escalate: gold-medal performance at international competitions, solving problems on PhD exams across multiple fields, writing and debugging complex code, fluency in dozens of languages, useful frontier research assistance as well as competent creative and practical problem-solving, from essay writing to trip planning. These achievements exceed many depictions of AGI in science fiction. The sentient supercomputer HAL 9000, from director Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, exhibited less breadth than current LLMs do. And current LLMs even exceed what we demand of humans: we credit individual people with general intelligence on the basis of much weaker evidence.\n\nSuperhuman level. Revolutionary scientific discoveries and consistent superiority over leading human experts across a range of domains. Such evidence would surely allow no reasonable debate about the presence of general intelligence in a machine — but it is not required evidence for its presence, because no human shows this.\n\nTuring’s vision realized\n\nCurrent LLMs already cover the first two levels. As LLMs tackle progressively more difficult problems, alternative explanations for their capabilities — for instance, that they are gigantic ‘lookup tables’8 that retrieve pre-computed answers or ‘stochastic parrots’9 that regurgitate shallow regularities without grasping meaning or structure — become increasingly disconfirmed.\n\nOften, however, such claims just reappear with different predictions. Hypotheses that retreat before each new success, always predicting failure just beyond current achievements, are not compelling scientific theories, but a dogmatic commitment to perpetual scepticism.\n\nAI language models killed the Turing test: do we even need a replacement?\n\nWe think the current evidence is clear. By inference to the best explanation — the same reasoning we use in attributing general intelligence to other people — we are observing AGI of a high degree. Machines such as those envisioned by Turing have arrived. Similar arguments have been made before10 (see also go.nature.com/49p6voq), and have engendered controversy and push-back. Our argument benefits from substantial advances and extra time. As of early 2026, the case for AGI is considerably more clear-cut.\n\nWe now examine ten common objections to the idea that current LLMs display general intelligence. Several of them echo objections that Turing himself considered in 1950. Each, we suggest, either conflates general intelligence with non-essential aspects of intelligence or applies standards that individual humans fail to meet.\n\nThey’re just parrots. The stochastic parrot objection says that LLMs merely interpolate training data. They can only recombine patterns they’ve encountered, so they must fail on genuinely new problems, or ‘out-of-distribution generalization’. This echoes ‘Lady Lovelace’s Objection’, inspired by Ada Lovelace’s 1843 remark and formulated by Turing as the claim that machines can “never do anything really new”1. Early LLMs certainly made mistakes on problems requiring reasoning and generalization beyond surface patterns in training data. But current LLMs can solve new, unpublished maths problems, perform near-optimal in-context statistical inference on scientific data11 and exhibit cross-domain transfer, in that training on code improves general reasoning across non-coding domains12. If critics demand revolutionary discoveries such as Einstein’s relativity, they are setting the bar too high, because very few humans make such discoveries either. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that human intelligence is not itself a sophisticated version of a stochastic parrot. All intelligence, human or artificial, must extract structure from correlational data; the question is how deep the extraction goes.\n\nThey lack world models. LLMs supposedly lack representations of their physical environment that are necessary for genuine understanding. But having a world model requires only the ability to predict what would happen if circumstances differed — to answer counterfactual questions. Ask a cutting-edge LLM what differs between dropping a glass or a pillow on a tile floor, and it will correctly predict shattering in one case and not the other. The ability of LLMs to solve olympiad mathematics and physics problems and assist with engineering design suggests that they possess functional models of physical principles. By these standards, LLMs already have world models. Furthermore, neural networks developed for specialized domains such as autonomous driving are already learning predictive models of physical scenes that support counterfactual reasoning and sophisticated physical awareness13.\n\nAlan Turing asked whether machines could think. Credit: Gerard Noonan/Alamy\n\nThey understand only words. This objection centres on the fact that LLMs are trained only on text, and so must be fundamentally limited to text-based tasks. Frontier models are now trained on images and other multimodal data, making this objection somewhat obsolete. Moreover, language is humanity’s most powerful tool for compressing and capturing knowledge about reality. LLMs can extract this compressed knowledge and apply it to distinctly non-linguistic tasks: helping researchers to design experiments — for example, suggesting what to test next in biology and materials science4 — goes beyond merely linguistic performance. We are yet to encounter the sharp limitations to LLM performance that this objection predicts.\n\nThey don’t have bodies. Without embodiment, critics argue, there can be no general intelligence. This reflects an anthropocentric bias that seems to be wielded only against AI. People would ascribe intelligence to a disembodied alien communicating by radio, or to a brain sustained in a vat. An entity that responds accurately to any question, but never moves or acts physically, would be regarded as profoundly intelligent. Physicist Stephen Hawking interacted with the world almost entirely through text and synthesized speech, yet his physical limitations in no way diminished his intelligence. Motor capabilities are separable from general intelligence.\n\nThey lack agency. It is true that present-day LLMs do not form independent goals or initiate action unprompted, as humans do. Even ‘agentic’ AI systems — such as frontier coding agents — typically act only when a user triggers a task, even if they can then automatically draft features and fix bugs. But intelligence does not require autonomy. Like the Oracle of Delphi — understood as a system that produces accurate answers only when queried — current LLMs need not initiate goals to count as intelligent. Humans typically have both general intelligence and autonomy, but we should not thereby conclude that one requires the other. Autonomy matters for moral responsibility, but it is not constitutive of intelligence.",

The process creates micro- and nano-scale pits that make the metal extremely water-repellent. When the treated tube is submerged, this textured surface captures a stable air pocket inside, acting as a built-in flotation system.\n\nTo ensure stability from all angles, the researchers added a divider to the center of each tube. This feature prevents air from escaping, even if the tube is pushed vertically into water.\n\n“This design helps maintain the air bubble inside the tube, so it keeps floating no matter the position,” Guo said.\n\nThe mechanism is reminiscent of amazing examples in nature of hydrophobic engineering at work, like how diving bell spiders carry air underwater or how fire ants form buoyant rafts during floods.\n\nDurable, adaptable, and scalable\n\nThis isn’t the lab’s first venture into floating materials. In 2019, Guo and his team created superhydrophobic disks that floated when sealed together. But their performance faltered under extreme angles or turbulence.\n\nThe new tube-based design addresses those limitations with a simpler, more robust structure.\n\nThe researchers tested the tubes in varied, challenging environments over several weeks and found that buoyancy remained unaffected. Even after punching multiple holes into the metal, the tubes continued to float. “We showed that even if you severely damage the tubes with as many holes as you can punch, they still float,” Guo said.\n\nThe team also tested different lengths, trying out up to nearly half a meter, and demonstrated that the design could be scaled up and linked together to create floating platforms.\n\nA foundation for floating energy systems\n\nBeyond buoyant materials, the researchers explored practical applications. One experiment showed how rafts built from these tubes could be used to harvest energy from wave motion, a promising development for off-grid power or renewable energy systems on the water.\n\nThat added functionality could make this technology especially valuable in remote or offshore environments, where both stability and low-maintenance design are key.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the University of Rochester’s Goergen Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWhat comes next\n\nWhile still in the research phase, the superhydrophobic tube design offers an adaptable foundation for various marine technologies such as unsinkable buoys, modular docks, emergency rescue gear, and more. It could even inform future ship designs that prioritize resilience without sacrificing simplicity.\n\nWith further development, these laser-treated tubes might become an elegant, scalable solution for some of the challenges of life on and near the water.\n\nSource study: Advanced Functional Materials—Geometry-enabled recoverable floating superhydrophobic metallic tubes",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Engineers at the University of Rochester wanted to find a way to make metal objects float reliably, even if they get damaged or sunk underwater. This could help with boats, rescue tools, and devices that use ocean waves for energy.\n\n**What happened** – Using tiny laser etching, researchers made special aluminum tubes that repel water and trap air inside.

      "summary": "MACE is a next-generation experiment designed to catch muonium transforming into its antimatter twin, a process that would rewrite the rules of particle physics. The last search for this effect ended more than two decades ago, and MACE plans to leap far beyond it using cutting-edge beams, targets, and detectors. A discovery would point to entirely new forces or particles operating at extreme energy scales.",
      "content": "An international team led by scientists at Sun Yat-sen University and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has launched an ambitious experiment known as MACE. The project is designed to look for an extremely rare event in which muonium, a short lived system made of a positive muon bound to an electron, spontaneously transforms into antimuonium, its antimatter counterpart. Observing such a process would break a fundamental rule of particle physics called lepton flavor conservation, which is a key part of the Standard Model, and would provide direct evidence for physics beyond existing theories.\n\n\"The conversion of muonium to antimuonium represents a clean and unique probe of new physics in the leptonic sector,\" explains the research team. \"Unlike other charged lepton flavor violation processes, this conversion is sensitive to ∆Lℓ = 2 models that are fundamentally distinct and could reveal physics inaccessible to other experiments.\"\n\nPushing Experimental Sensitivity to New Limits\n\nThe most recent experimental constraint on muonium converting into antimuonium was established in 1999 at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. MACE aims to go far beyond that result by improving sensitivity by more than a hundred times, with the goal of detecting conversion probabilities as small as O(10-13). Reaching this level requires advances throughout the entire experimental system, including a powerful surface muon beam, a newly developed silica aerogel target, and detectors capable of extremely precise measurements.\n\n\"Our design integrates advanced beam, muonium production target, and detector technology to isolate the signal from formidable backgrounds,\" says the team. \"This makes MACE one of the most sensitive low-energy experiments searching for lepton flavor violation.\"\n\nWhat a Discovery Could Reveal\n\nIf the experiment succeeds, it could allow scientists to explore new physics at energy scales ranging from 10 to 100 TeV, a level that rivals or even surpasses what future particle colliders are expected to achieve. MACE is also planned to operate in an initial Phase I stage, during which it will investigate other exceptionally rare muonium decay processes and lepton flavor violating events, including M→γγ and μ→eγγ, with record breaking sensitivity.\n\nThe impact of MACE extends beyond fundamental physics. Technologies developed for the experiment, such as advanced muonium production targets, low energy positron transport systems, and high resolution detectors, may also find uses in fields like materials science and medical research.\n\nStrengthening Global Particle Physics Efforts\n\nMACE is part of a larger scientific push centered on Huizhou's major research facilities, including the High-intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) and the China initiative Accelerator Driven System (CiADS). Together, these projects aim to establish China as a global leader in high precision nuclear and particle physics. By drawing on these advanced facilities, MACE demonstrates how basic research can fuel both technological progress and international collaboration.\n\n\"We are not just building an experiment; we are opening a new window into the laws of nature,\" the team notes. \"Each component of MACE -- from the beamline to the software -- has been optimized to explore physics that could redefine our understanding of matter, symmetry, and the universe itself.\"",
