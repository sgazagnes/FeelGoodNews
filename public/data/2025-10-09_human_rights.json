      "summary": "The offer sounded almost unreal. The UN was fishing around for someone with a knack for building prisons – preferably a woman – to join its mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Would she go?",
      "content": "Olukemi Ibikunle took a deep breath. The job fit her to a T but would take her far from her family in Lagos, Nigeria. Then the 38-year-old project manager did what any meticulous planner would: she called home.\n\n“I spoke to my husband, and he said, ‘Why are you asking me? Go, go, go! Tell them yes!’”\n\nHis enthusiasm heartened her. But how could he manage all by himself, she argued. Their two children were only seven and 10. He countered with a single, disarming question. “These children you’re talking about…can you tell me their surname?” She did. “That’s my name,” he replied. “Leave them with me.”\n\n© MONUSCO Olukemi Ibikunle, 43, a corrections officer from Nigeria, is the 2025 laureate of the United Nations Trailblazer Award for Women Justice and Corrections Officers.\n\nArchitect of dignity\n\nThe year was 2020, and Kemi, as she is known, had made herself indispensable within Nigeria’s prison service.\n\nWhen a roof leaked, a wall buckled, or a block had to be designed from scratch, she was the person people called. In Lagos State, she oversaw five custodial centers holding nearly 9,000 detainees – not a small feat in a field still largely dominated by men.\n\nThe work was pitilessly specific, the kind that played to the strengths of the no-nonsense geologist by training: no glass windows or ceramic basins that could shatter into weapons; reinforced bars for light without risk.\n\n“We bring the balance between respect for the dignity of persons and security,” she said. Even in a prison block, toilets must have privacy. “We use what we call a ‘dwarf door’: I can see your feet and it’s covered up just to your neck, so I can know if you’re trying to commit suicide.”\n\nThat balance was exactly what the UN was looking for. MONUSCO, its peacekeeping operation in the DRC, wanted someone who could walk the line between safety and human rights. “Competence doesn’t have gender,” she said, speaking with the calm of someone who has watched concrete set in real time.\n\nKemi landed in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, with a remit that on paper sounded administrative: to help reform the country’s ailing prison system. In practice, it meant redesigning the everyday landscape of incarceration in a post-conflict State – pipe by pipe, door by door.\n\nChanging minds\n\nPrison reform, she knew, had to start with floor plans. MONUSCO’s corrections team sat down with national authorities to make the case for the Mandela Rules and Bangkok Rules – international standards calling for humane treatment of prisoners and gender-sensitive detention practices. But they were met with resistance and a narrow view of what a prison could be.\n\n“They didn’t see why we needed to include a library or a workshop in the design,” Kemi recalled. So she tried a different tack. When prisons have sports centres, she explained, inmates are healthier because they exercise their bodies. “And with a library,” she added, “they can spend their time reading instead of thinking about how to break out.”\n\nThe message eventually sank in. She and her colleagues drafted a blueprint for new facilities nationwide and mapped the existing ones, deciding which to rehabilitate and which to write off.\n\nAlong the way, she insisted on building separate prisons for women. “Don’t just have a female block in a male prison,” she said – that’s a recipe for exposing women to sexual exploitation and violence. When complete separation wasn’t possible, she pushed for fences and independent hallways.\n\n© MONUSCO Olukemi Ibikunle (center) organizes a tailoring workshop to support the reintegration of female detainees in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nBreaking the mould\n\nIn the field, at first, Kemi brushed off the ritual sexist comments. Who was this “short girl” who wanted to see receipts, inspect rebar, question the sand-to-cement ratio, and verify the workers’ qualifications?\n\nHer native Yoruba – and even her Nigerian English – were of no help. She picked up the technical French on the fly – armatures, agglo, dalles – and used the Congolese pricing repertoire to deflate padded bids. “This is overrated,” she would say. “We can cut down this budget.”\n\nOne site was supposed to have air conditioning throughout, but the builder showed up with standing fans. “I brought out the project document… trois climatiseurs,” she recalled, tracing a line in the air, the way she had then, with her pen. Case closed. Eventually, when contractors called Kinshasa to complain, they got the same answer: “Talk to Kemi.”\n\nWhen the rebels came\n\nBy 2023, Kemi had been deployed east, to the province of South Kivu. In the city of Kabare, she oversaw the construction of an $850,000 high-security facility designed to hold “difficult people,” many linked to armed groups. It was a large-scale project. She supervised the site day after day, commuting 20 kilometers each way from Bukavu, the provincial capital.\n\nThen, in January, the M23 militia launched a major offensive in the area. Under an agreement with Kinshasa, MONUSCO had withdrawn its peacekeepers from South Kivu the previous year, leaving only its corrections team in place.\n\nUN troops remained stationed solely in the nearby provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. By the time the Tutsi-led rebels reached Bukavu’s outskirts, Kemi was the only one left from the mission.\n\nThe evacuation of foreign personnel was chaotic. “We had to go through land borders without any UN logistics, each person finding their own way out, somehow,” she said.\n\nM23 fighters, backed by neighboring Rwanda – although Kigali has repeatedly denied this – had seized control of Lake Kivu, making navigation impossible. With only a backpack to her name, she caught a ride with two human-rights colleagues just before the city fell.\n\nAlong the way, her husband kept messaging her on WhatsApp: Where are you? Are you okay? So as not to worry him, she replied simply, “I’m fine.” Only now does she allow herself to look back on that moment. “It was a scary period…the few of us who remained, we became like family.”\n\nAt the Rwandan border, the uniform on her photo ID drew a harder stare. “They looked at it and said, ‘You’re police.’ I said, ‘No, I’m not police; I’m correctional.’ They said, ‘It’s the same – you’re police!’” She was pulled aside for questioning. Calls were made. Then more calls. Eventually, she was let through.\n\nNow stationed in Beni, a city still under Government control in North Kivu, she continues her work with MONUSCO’s corrections team. The large prison project she once oversaw in Kabare, however, remains on standby.\n\n© MONUSCO Olukemi Ibikunle (center) supervises the construction of a prison in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nA trailblazer’s recognition\n\nThis week, Kemi’s work is receiving international recognition as the 2025 winner of the UN Trailblazer Award for Women Justice and Corrections Officers – an honour that celebrates women who break gender barriers in peace operations and redefine what leadership looks like behind prison walls.\n\nBy the time I met her at UN Headquarters on the eve of Wednesday’s ceremony, she was already something of a local celebrity.\n\nOn the way to our interview, a UN security guard – a fellow Yoruba – recognized her at once and came over to congratulate her.\n\nUvira: Where waste became fuel\n\nThe stories she talks about most vividly predate the M23 turmoil — tangible projects that quietly transformed life behind bars.\n\nOne stands out: the biogas system she helped launch in 2021 at Uvira Prison, in South Kivu, where human waste was turned into cooking gas. Kitchen fires no longer fed on forests. Sewage stopped bursting through cracked pipes. “No more odour,” she said.\n\nHer team trained officers and long-term detainees to maintain the system. After MONUSCO’s withdrawal from the province, water deliveries stopped; a borehole was funded from afar and monitored through shaky video calls.\n\nIn 2024, she made the eight-hour drive to see for herself. “My joy was that the biogas system was still working…Three and a half years later, everything was like the way we left it.”\n\nThe officers told her the installation was “tamper-proof” and largely self-sustaining. The line that stayed with her came like a benediction: “This is the best thing you have done for us.”\n\nThe female inmates of Bukavu\n\nAnother memory – almost trivial in cost but immense in meaning – came from the Bukavu prison, which held 80 women and more than 1,400 men. Each morning, sacks of food went to the men. The women, she said, simply got “nothing.” Officials told her their families brought them meals and charities filled the gaps. Why spend the prison’s ration on them?\n\nThen there was the kitchen itself: a ruin of soot and broken stoves, each woman cooking over a single charcoal flame. Kemi wouldn’t have it. She scraped together $2,000 from leftover budget lines, bought pots and bowls, hired a technician, and stood beside him until the kitchen drew breath again.\n\nBut the real battle was bureaucratic. She went to the prison chief and argued that the Government provided food for every prisoner – not just for men.\n\nFor two weeks straight, she showed up at 7am to make sure the rations were shared fairly. She watched the beans being measured out, nudging the portion from one bucket to two, then three, until fairness became routine. “Eventually,” she said, “it became a norm: in the morning, men get their food – and women get also.”\n\nIf the women couldn’t thank her aloud, they did it silently – a small, wordless thumbs-up each time she stepped into the yard.\n\nThe cost of leaving\n\nDuring her missions, Kemi never stops being a mother, staying close to her children through long-distance video calls. “We talk on WhatsApp,” she said. “On their way to school they always call. Even on my flight here, I had Wi-Fi, so I was able to communicate with them.” In Lagos, her husband works from home, keeping the family’s rhythm intact.\n\nWhen she first left for the DRC, her seven-year-old son played it cool. “You’re leaving tomorrow? Okay, see you,” he said, while his older sister clung to her, asking for “five more minutes.”\n\nBut after the chaos of her evacuation from Bukavu, the boy – now a teenager – dropped the act. He broke down in tears. “You can just come home,” he told her. “You don’t need to work. Daddy will take care of us.” She smiled and gave him the only answer she knows: “It’s not just about money. It’s about doing something for myself – and for you.”\n\nUN Photo/Evan Schneider Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed (right) presents the Trailblazer Award to the 2025 winner Olukemi Ibikunle, a correctional officer from Nigeria deployed to MONUSCO.\n\nThe smallest details\n\nKemi often returns to the same guiding principle: that dignity lies in the smallest details – a dwarf door, a kitchen pot, a pipe that doesn’t burst.\n\nThis Wednesday in New York, she walked onto a stage to receive the Trailblazer Award. For a few ceremonial minutes, she was visible – the applause, the photographs, the quoted lines.\n\nBut afterwards, she will return to the quiet work that defines her: the blueprint, the ledger, the early-morning checks – and the long, stubborn labour of proving, one repaired kitchen and one quiet library at a time, that peace begins behind prison walls.",

      "content": "'Half my mind is still in Gaza': Evacuated teacher begins studies in UK\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Caroline Hawley BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Share Save\n\nSana el-Azab Sana el-Azab arrived in the English cathedral city of Durham late last month\n\nIt's a very long way - in every possible sense - from Deir al-Balah in the centre of the Gaza Strip to Durham in north-eastern England. \"It's another planet, not just another world,\" says Sana el-Azab, who arrived in the cathedral city late last month after being evacuated to the UK with 33 other students. \"No-one can understand what I lived through in Gaza.\" In June, the 29-year-old former teacher was awarded a scholarship at Durham University to study educational leadership and change. Weeks of uncertainty followed, as British politicians and academics lobbied for her - and dozens of other Gazan students with fully-funded places - to be allowed to come to the UK. But in the dead of night, on 17 September, \"the big moment\" that she'd been waiting for finally arrived and Sana left her home first for Jordan, for biometric tests, and then for Durham. This is the first time that she, and other Gaza students who have been brought to the UK, have spoken publicly. \"There's no chance to continue your higher education in Gaza,\" she told me. \"All the universities are destroyed. There's no education system at all anymore.\" The main campus of Al-Azhar University – one of the biggest and oldest Palestinian academic institutions, where Sana did a BA in English literature - is now reported to have been reduced to rubble by Israeli bombardment and controlled demolitions.\n\nReuters All formal education at Gaza's Al-Azhar University, where Sana did her BA, has been on hold since 2023\n\nFor two years, all formal face-to-face education has been on hold, with the UN warning of a \"lost generation\" of children. Schools were turned into shelters for displaced people. And 97% of them have sustained some level of damage from the war, according to the Global Education Cluster, a partnership of UN agencies and NGOs. Many were directly hit by air strikes which the Israeli military said targeted operatives of Hamas and other armed groups. Almost 660,000 children remain out of school. About 87,000 university students have also been affected. In June, a UN independent international commission of inquiry said Israel had \"obliterated Gaza's education system\". \"My six-year old niece asked me what it's like to be in school,\" Sana says. \"She doesn't know. Imagine what they've all missed out on. This is now the third year.\" In April last year, Sana set up her own makeshift school in a roof-less building at her home in Deir al-Balah. Twenty girls between the ages of seven and 12 usually attended class. At times, she had up to 50 students. \"I saw displaced children just spending their time in queues for food and water - not having a childhood, and I wanted to do something, for them,\" she says. \"There were drones overhead 24 hours and bombing around us.\" But the children were keen. \"I wanted to give them a little normalcy.\" She taught them English at first, adding a bit of maths, at the children's request. There were weekly art classes to allow the girls to express their trauma. \"No parent had time to talk to their children about their feelings,\" she says. And there was a simple daily meal because: \"It's not easy to teach hungry kids.\" She says she also taught them \"survival skills\" – including how to filter water with charcoal to make it safer to use.\n\nSana el-Azab Sana says she taught her students everything from English to \"survival skills\"\n\nLeaving them and her extended family behind was a tough decision. For her, and all the students who have arrived in the UK, there's a mixture of pride and guilt. \"I left with just my mobile phone and the clothes I was wearing - that's all I was allowed to take,\" she says. \"I'm so proud that I made it here. But it's very complicated. I can't process everything. It's overwhelming. \"I'm relieved and grateful and happy that I got out but I feel sorrow at leaving behind my precious siblings, and nieces and nephews, and elderly parents in that dire situation.\" In all, 58 students from Gaza have now arrived to take up scholarships at more than 30 universities around the UK. After the first group of 34 arrived last month, another group of 24 came last week. Twenty more are waiting to come out of Gaza. \"It's been a relentless and very, very difficult process, when it should have been much easier,\" says Nora Parr, an academic and researcher at Birmingham University, who has co-ordinated the educational evacuations. \"These are the people who are going to rebuild Gaza,\" she says. \"They want to do everyone proud and learn as much as they can. I wish they could have come a week or two before their courses started to help them settle in.\" She adds: \"But I hope this is an opportunity that can be built on because the needs are massive.\"\n\nEPA Schools were turned into shelters for displaced people at the start of the war",

Behind the scenes is an app called Food Rescue Hero, which coordinates pickups of surplus food and connects volunteers with organizations ready to distribute it.\n\nThe power of a simple delivery\n\nFood Rescue Hero is part of a growing wave of tech solutions addressing two intersecting crises: food waste and food insecurity. According to the USDA, up to 40 percent of food produced in the U.S. is wasted. Meanwhile, about 13.5 million households, roughly 10 percent, struggle with food insecurity.\n\nRather than letting edible food go to waste, apps like Food Rescue Hero, Flashfood, Too Good To Go, and Olio help redirect that food to those who need it most. The Food Rescue Hero app shows volunteers when and where food is available, be it leftovers from a corporate lunch or excess airport snacks, and assigns them routes to deliver it to food banks, shelters, or directly to community members.\n\n“It’s a game-changing, powerful technology,” says Jake Tepperman, executive director of Chicago Food Rescue, which uses the app. With only two employees and no dedicated drivers, Tepperman’s team has been able to move the equivalent of 88,000 meals in under a year. “It allows us to decentralize food transportation and scale in a way that is just not possible without intuitive tech,” he explains.\n\nHow apps tackle hunger, one route at a time\n\nThe app uses GPS, AI-driven algorithms, and geolocation tools to optimize deliveries and make sure food reaches the right place at the right time. It also emphasizes “meeting people where they are,” says Tepperman. That might mean bringing groceries directly to someone’s home, or stocking a public community fridge.\n\nResearch backs up the impact. Studies from Stanford University and the University of Pittsburgh found that communities using the app saw measurable decreases in food insecurity and improvements in diet quality.\n\nIt’s not just about tech; it’s about community, too. Many organizations using these apps rely on volunteers and local partnerships to extend their reach without needing large infrastructure or fleets of trucks.\n\nRising need meets shrinking support\n\nThese solutions are emerging at a time when government food assistance is being scaled back. In July, the current administration enacted a ten-year, $187 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the largest reduction in its history.\n\nAbout 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, but many are now left wondering how long that safety net will hold. Dameon, for instance, receives just $91 a month. “If I was to lose SNAP benefits,” he says, “there would be a way that I just feel that God would provide something, because it’s not the end of the world. You feel that it is, with the way that we’re going.”\n\nAlyssa Cholodofsky, CEO of 412 Food Rescue, the organization that developed the Food Rescue Hero app, says nonprofits are being asked to do more as federal support shrinks. “The federal government has traditionally been the largest source of helping people meet basic needs,” she says. “As that pulls back, it leaves a lot of people in some pretty difficult situations.”\n\nLooking ahead\n\nFood Rescue Hero is now used in over two dozen North American cities, with a goal to expand to 100 cities in the next five years. As food deserts persist, impacting nearly 19 million Americans, the app offers a promising path to more equitable food access.\n\nIt may not replace national policy, but for people like Dameon, it’s already changing lives.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many Americans struggle to get enough food. About 13.5 million households don’t always have enough to eat. At the same time, a large amount of food—up to 40%—is wasted in the U.S. Meanwhile, government programs that help feed people are getting smaller.\n\n**What happened** – A nonprofit in Chicago called Brave Space Alliance uses an app named Food Rescue Hero to connect volunteers with extra food. Volunteers pick up leftover or surplus food from places like offices and airports and deliver it to people in need, including directly to homes. This app helps organize and plan these deliveries using technology like GPS.\n\n**Impact** – This system has helped move the equivalent of 88,000 meals in less than a year in Chicago alone. Studies show that communities using the app have less hunger and better diets. The app makes it easier for small groups to help without needing big trucks or lots of staff. For people like Dameon, who used to be homeless, this means getting regular fresh groceries and better chances to stay healthy.\n\n**What's next step** – Food Rescue Hero is expanding to more than two dozen cities now and hopes to reach 100 cities in five years. As food deserts—areas where it’s hard to buy fresh food—affect millions, this app could help more communities get better access to food.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Food rescue apps are using technology and volunteers to turn wasted food into meals for millions of Americans facing hunger.\n",

This was reported by European Commissioner for Equality Hadja Lahbib.\n\n“Conversion practices are not therapies. They are harmful, can cause physical and mental problems, and especially undermine the dignity of the individuals involved,” said Lahbib during the presentation of the European LGBTQI+ strategy for 2026-2030.\n\nOne in four LGBTQI+ individuals, and nearly half of transgender men and women, have already experienced such practices, whether it involves physical or sexual violence, verbal abuse, or humiliation. “That must stop,” said the Belgian Commissioner.\n\n“Conversion therapy” refers to a range of practices aimed at changing a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Certain EU member states still require surgical or medical interventions for legal recognition of gender.\n\nThese practices can be equated with torture and should be banned, according to experts from the United Nations. The Netherlands will soon become the ninth country to ban these practices, while Belgium has already done so. In recent months, a citizen initiative calling for a European ban has gathered more than 1.2 million signatures.\n\n“We will work with the member states, with full respect for their competencies, to put an end to these harmful practices,” Lahbib added. “But we do not yet have a clear understanding of what these practices entail.
