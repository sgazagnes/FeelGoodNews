      "content": "About 4600 years ago, the population of Britain was replaced by a people who brought Bell Beaker pottery with them. Now, ancient DNA has uncovered the murky story of where these people came from\n\nThe ancestors of the British Bell Beaker people lived in a wetland area and relied heavily on fishing SHEILA TERRY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n\nAnalysis of ancient DNA has uncovered the origins of a mysterious group who appeared in Britain around 2400 BC and, in a century or less, all but replaced the people who built Stonehenge.\n\nThese people were associated with the Bell Beaker culture, which emerged in western Europe in the early Bronze Age and is named for the shape of the typical pots they left behind. This culture probably originated in Portugal or Spain, but the new study reveals that the people who took over Britain came from just across the North Sea, in the river deltas of the Low Countries. This resilient population had preserved some of its hunter-gatherer lifestyle and ancestry for millennia after early farmers had swept across Europe.\n\nDavid Reich at Harvard University and his colleagues studied the genomes of 112 people who lived in what is now the Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany between 8500 and 1700 BC.\n\nBefore joining the project, Reich wasn’t too excited, he admits: “The Netherlands seemed like the most boring place in the world – every single bit of ground there has been walked on a million times before. But it turned out to be perhaps the most interesting place in Europe.”\n\nThe DNA sequenced by his lab revealed a population forged in the Rhine-Meuse delta in the Dutch-Belgian borderlands, originating from a resourceful group of hunter-gatherers surviving in the waterlogged wetlands around these big rivers, feeding on fish, waterfowl, game and various plants.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nNeolithic farmers originating in Anatolia spread across Europe from around 6500 BC, probably because their ability to produce their own food meant they could raise many more children than hunter-gatherers did. In just a few centuries, hunter-gatherer genetic ancestry disappeared or was strongly diluted in each place where the farmers arrived.\n\nBut not, the ancient DNA reveals, in these wetlands, where the influx of farmer genes remained sparse for several thousand years. The dynamic, regularly flooded landscape of rivers, marshes, dunes and peat bogs was a nightmare for early farmers, but rich in opportunities for those who knew how to survive there, says team member Luc Amkreutz at the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, the Netherlands. “These hunter-gatherers were carving their own path, from a position of strength.”\n\nJudging from the DNA, these people were far from marginalised. Their Y chromosomes, passed down from father to son, remained largely hunter-gatherer for another 1500 years or so after the arrival of farmers in the region, while their mitochondrial DNA and X chromosomes reveal a steady trickle of farmers’ daughters joining them. “This really was a surprise to us,” says team member Eveline Altena at Leiden University Medical Center. “Something you can’t really tell without DNA.”\n\nThis was probably a mostly peaceful process involving communities where women tend to move while men stay in their homesteads, says Reich, although an element of force can’t be ruled out. This exchange may have gone both ways, but DNA preservation is much worse in the drier areas where farmers lived, so this remains unknown for now, he says.\n\nBell Beaker pottery from Germany Peter Endig/dpa picture alliance/Alamy\n\nArchaeological remains reveal that, over time, the hunter-gatherers did gradually adopt pottery, grow some grain and raise some animals, but without abandoning their original lifestyle.\n\nThen, around 3000 BC, a tribe of nomadic herders called the Yamna, or Yamnaya, from the steppes of what is now Ukraine and Russia started migrating to the west. Their encounters with eastern European farmers gave rise to the Corded Ware culture, named for the cord-like decoration of its pottery. Their descendants which swept across much of Europe, but hardly made a dent in the delta.\n\nThe study identified one skeleton from this time with a Yamna Y chromosome, and excavations have also revealed pots, some of which were used to cook fish – another example of the wetlanders using new objects from abroad in their own way. Overall, though, few people had much, if any, steppe ancestry.\n\nThat changed when, around 2500 BC, the Bell Beaker culture appeared. These people introduced steppe ancestry into the wetland people’s DNA, but a significant 13 to 18 per cent of their characteristic hunter-gatherer-early-farmer gene mix remained. They might have started fading into history right then. But it turns out they weren’t quite done yet.\n\nA skeleton buried at Oostwoud in the Netherlands, whose DNA was analysed in the study Provinciaal Archeologisch Depot North-Holland (CC by 4.0)\n\nThe new study reveals that the people who arrived in Britain around 2400 BC had almost the exact same blend of Bell Beaker and wetland community genes. And within a century, they would nearly – or even entirely – replace the Neolithic farmers who had built Stonehenge. “Our models indicate that at least 90 per cent, but up to 100 per cent, of the original ancestry was lost [from Britain],” says Reich.\n\nIt isn’t entirely clear if this started with the arrival of the Bell Beaker culture in Britain or if other people had been moving in earlier. Before the Bell Beakers arrived, people in Britain were cremating their dead instead of burying them, which means they rarely left DNA.\n\nIn any case, what happened was “very dramatic, unbelievable almost”, says Reich. The reasons for this rapid replacement have intrigued archaeologists since it was first suggested by a 2018 study. Reich suspects the involvement of a disease like the plague, to which people on the European continent may have been exposed before. People in Britain, meanwhile, may have been more vulnerable to it.\n\nWhat probably didn’t play a role is religious fervour, says team member Harry Fokkens at Leiden University. “Existing monuments like Stonehenge and Avebury remained in use and were even expanded after the people who made them were gone.”\n\nMichael Parker Pearson at University College London is intrigued by the extent to which the new population adopted Britain’s monument styles, such as henges and stone circles, even though they brought a completely new way of life with them, including new styles of pottery and dress.\n\nThe Bell Beaker people also introduced metals to Britain, he adds. “Some gold hair ornaments found in Beaker graves in Britain are nearly identical to ones found in Belgium.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Around 4600 years ago, the people living in Britain were mostly replaced by newcomers linked to the Bell Beaker culture. This culture is known for its distinctive pottery and spread during Europe’s early Bronze Age.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists studied ancient DNA from people who lived in the river delta region between today’s Netherlands, Belgium, and western Germany. They found that these wetland communities, who lived mainly by fishing and hunting, kept their unique ancestry for thousands of years even after farmers spread across Europe. Around 2400 BC, people from this group mixed with newcomers carrying steppe ancestry and moved to Britain, replacing almost all of the original Neolithic farmers there.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery changes what we know about how Britain’s population and culture shifted in prehistory. Rather than coming directly from southern Europe, the Bell Beaker people who arrived in Britain came from northern river wetlands just across the North Sea. It also shows that some groups kept old lifestyles for a very long time, adapting slowly while still mixing with others. The study helps explain how ancient cultures and genes moved across Europe.\n\n**What’s next step** – Researchers will continue studying ancient DNA from different places and times to better understand how people moved, mixed, and changed cultures. They also want to explore why such a big population replacement happened in Britain, possibly linked to diseases like the plague.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Ancient DNA reveals Britain’s Bronze Age newcomers came from northern wetlands, replacing earlier farmers and reshaping the island’s ancient population.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Il y a environ 4600 ans, la population vivant en Grande-Bretagne a été presque entièrement remplacée par un nouveau groupe lié à la culture Bell Beaker, connue pour ses poteries distinctives.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des scientifiques ont étudié l’ADN ancien de personnes vivant dans la région des deltas fluviaux entre les Pays-Bas, la Belgique et l’ouest de l’Allemagne. Ils ont découvert que ces communautés de zones humides, vivant principalement de la pêche et de la chasse, ont conservé leur ascendance unique pendant des milliers d’années, même après l’arrivée des agriculteurs en Europe. Vers 2400 avant notre ère, ces groupes ont mélangé leurs gènes avec ceux de nouveaux venus porteurs d’ascendance des steppes et sont arrivés en Grande-Bretagne, remplaçant presque tous les agriculteurs néolithiques.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte modifie notre compréhension des changements de population et de culture en Grande-Bretagne préhistorique. Au lieu de venir directement du sud de l’Europe, les Bell Beaker arrivés en Grande-Bretagne venaient des zones humides du nord, juste de l’autre côté de la mer du Nord. Elle montre aussi que certains groupes ont conservé leurs modes de vie anciens très longtemps, en s’adaptant lentement tout en se mélangeant avec d’autres. L’étude aide à comprendre comment les cultures et les gènes anciens ont circulé en Europe.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs poursuivront l’étude de l’ADN ancien dans différents lieux et époques pour mieux comprendre les déplacements, mélanges et évolutions culturelles. Ils veulent aussi étudier pourquoi ce remplacement de population a été si rapide en Grande-Bretagne, peut-être lié à des maladies comme la peste.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – L’ADN ancien révèle que les nouveaux arrivants de l’âge du bronze en Grande-Bretagne venaient des zones humides du nord, remplaçant les premiers agriculteurs et transformant la population ancienne de l’île.\n",

Descubrieron que estas comunidades de zonas húmedas, que vivían principalmente de la pesca y la caza, mantuvieron su ascendencia única durante miles de años, incluso después de que los agricultores se extendieran por Europa. Alrededor del 2400 a.C., estas personas mezclaron su ADN con recién llegados con ascendencia de las estepas y se mudaron a Gran Bretaña, reemplazando casi a todos los agricultores neolíticos.\n\n**Impacto** – Este hallazgo cambia lo que sabíamos sobre cómo cambió la población y cultura en la prehistoria de Gran Bretaña.

      "summary": "Your cat’s purr may say more about who they are than their meow ever could. Scientists discovered that purrs are stable and uniquely identifiable, while meows change dramatically depending on context. Domestic cats, in particular, have evolved highly flexible meows as a way to communicate with humans. The purr, meanwhile, stays constant—making it a reliable marker of individual identity.",
      "content": "A new study from researchers at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin and the University of Naples Federico II has uncovered an unexpected truth about cat communication. A domestic cat's purr reveals much more about its individual identity than its meow. Meows change widely depending on context, while purring stays consistent enough to clearly distinguish one cat from another.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, scientists used automatic speech recognition techniques and analyzed recordings from the Animal Sound Archive at the Berlin Natural History Museum. They examined vocalizations from both domestic and wild cats and found that domestication has especially increased how much a cat's meow can vary.\n\nWhy Meows Change but Purrs Stay the Same\n\n\"People pay most attention to meowing because cats mainly use these vocalizations toward us,\" explains the study's first author, Danilo Russo. \"But once we examined the acoustic structure closely, the even, rhythmic purr turned out to be the better cue for identifying individual cats.\"\n\nThe research team, which also included bioacoustician Mirjam Knörnschild from the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, applied sound analysis tools originally designed for human speech. They asked a straightforward question: can a computer correctly match a vocal sound to the cat that produced it using sound alone? While both meows and purrs contained individual traits, purrs were far more reliable.\n\nThe Many Roles of Purring and Meowing\n\n\"Every cat in our study had its own characteristic purr,\" says co-author Anja Schild. \"Purring often occurs in relaxed situations, such as during petting or close contact with a familiar person. It also is used for communication between the mother and her kittens shortly after birth. Meowing, on the other hand, is famous for its versatility.\"\n\nCats use meows in many different situations, especially when interacting with humans. They may meow to ask for food, demand attention, or even \"complain.\" This behavioral flexibility showed up clearly in the data, with meows displaying much greater variation within the same individual cat.\n\nDomestication Changed the Cat's Voice\n\nTo better understand how evolution shaped these sounds, the researchers compared domestic cat meows with those of five wild cat species: African wildcat, European wildcat, jungle cat, cheetah, and cougar. These comparisons also relied on recordings from the Animal Sound Archive at the Museum für Naturkunde.\n\nDomestic cats stood out immediately. Their meows varied far more than those of their wild relatives, suggesting that life alongside humans reshaped how cats use their voices.\n\n\"Living with humans -- who differ greatly in their routines, expectations, and responses -- likely favored cats that could flexibly adjust their meows. Our results support the idea that meows have evolved into a highly adaptable tool for negotiating life in a human-dominated world,\" says senior author Mirjam Knörnschild.\n\nWhat Cat Sounds Reveal About Communication\n\nOverall, the findings offer a detailed look at how cats communicate. Purrs, which are low-frequency and highly consistent, act as dependable identity signals that help cats and humans recognize familiar individuals in close social settings. Meows serve a different purpose. Rather than signaling identity, they emphasize adaptability, allowing cats to express a wide range of needs and emotions to the people they live with.\n\nTogether, these results highlight how domestication shaped the modern cat's voice, turning the meow into a flexible communication tool while leaving the purr as a steady marker of individuality.",
