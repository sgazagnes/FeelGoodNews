      "summary": "Alzheimer’s has long been considered irreversible, but new research challenges that assumption. Scientists discovered that severe drops in the brain’s energy supply help drive the disease—and restoring that balance can reverse damage, even in advanced cases. In mouse models, treatment repaired brain pathology, restored cognitive function, and normalized Alzheimer’s biomarkers. The results offer fresh hope that recovery may be possible.",
      "content": "A study reveals that restoring the brain's energy balance may not just slow Alzheimer's -- but actually reverse it.\n\nFor more than a century, Alzheimer's disease has been widely viewed as permanent and untreatable once it begins. As a result, most research has focused on preventing the disease or slowing its progression rather than attempting to reverse it.\n\nBy studying multiple mouse models of Alzheimer's alongside human Alzheimer's brain tissue, researchers identified a critical biological problem at the center of the disease. They found that the brain's inability to maintain healthy levels of a vital cellular energy molecule called NAD+ plays a major role in driving Alzheimer's.\n\nIn animal models, maintaining normal brain NAD+ levels prevented Alzheimer's from developing. Even more striking, restoring NAD+ balance after the disease was already advanced allowed the brain to repair damage and fully restore cognitive function.\n\nThese results suggest that treatments aimed at restoring the brain's energy balance could potentially move Alzheimer's therapy beyond slowing decline and toward meaningful recovery.\n\nThe findings also open the door to further research, including the exploration of complementary strategies and carefully designed clinical trials to determine whether these results can translate to patients.\n\nA Longstanding View of Alzheimer's Is Being Questioned\n\nFor more than 100 years, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been widely viewed as a condition that cannot be undone. Because of this belief, most scientific efforts have focused on preventing the disease or slowing its progression, rather than attempting to restore lost brain function. Even after decades of research and billions of dollars in investment, no drug trial for Alzheimer's has ever been designed with the goal of reversing the disease and recovering cognitive abilities.\n\nThat long-held assumption is now being challenged by researchers from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center. Their work set out to answer a bold question: can brains already damaged by advanced Alzheimer's recover?\n\nNew Study Targets Brain Energy Failure\n\nThe research was led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, of the Pieper Laboratory and published on December 22 in Cell Reports Medicine. By examining both human Alzheimer's brain tissue and multiple preclinical mouse models, the team identified a key biological failure at the center of the disease. They found that the brain's inability to maintain normal levels of a critical cellular energy molecule called NAD+ plays a major role in driving Alzheimer's. Importantly, maintaining proper NAD+ balance was shown to not only prevent the disease but also reverse it in experimental models.\n\nNAD+ levels naturally decline throughout the body, including the brain, as people age. When NAD+ drops too low, cells lose the ability to carry out essential processes needed for normal function and survival. The researchers discovered that this decline is far more severe in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. The same pattern was seen in mouse models of the disease.\n\nHow Alzheimer's Was Modeled in the Lab\n\nAlthough Alzheimer's occurs only in humans, scientists study it using specially engineered mice that carry genetic mutations known to cause the disease in people. In this study, researchers used two such models. One group of mice carried multiple human mutations affecting amyloid processing, while the other carried a human mutation in the tau protein.\n\nAmyloid and tau abnormalities are among the earliest and most significant features of Alzheimer's. In both mouse models, these mutations led to widespread brain damage that closely mirrors the human disease. This included breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, damage to nerve fibers, chronic inflammation, reduced formation of new neurons in the hippocampus, weakened communication between brain cells, and extensive oxidative damage. The mice also developed severe memory and cognitive problems similar to those seen in people with Alzheimer's.\n\nTesting Whether Alzheimer's Damage Could Be Reversed\n\nAfter confirming that NAD+ levels dropped sharply in both human and mouse Alzheimer's brains, the team explored two possibilities. They tested whether maintaining NAD+ balance before symptoms appeared could prevent Alzheimer's, and whether restoring that balance after the disease had already progressed could reverse it.\n\nThis approach built on the group's earlier work published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, which showed that restoring NAD+ balance led to both structural and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. In the current study, the researchers used a well-characterized pharmacologic compound called P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper laboratory, to restore NAD+ balance.\n\nFull Cognitive Recovery Observed in Advanced Disease\n\nThe results were striking. Preserving NAD+ balance protected mice from developing Alzheimer's, but even more surprising was what happened when treatment began after the disease was already advanced. In those cases, restoring NAD+ balance allowed the brain to repair the major pathological damage caused by the genetic mutations.\n\nBoth mouse models showed complete recovery of cognitive function. This recovery was also reflected in blood tests, which showed normalized levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker used to diagnose Alzheimer's in people. These findings provided strong evidence of disease reversal and highlighted a potential biomarker for future human trials.\n\nResearchers Express Cautious Optimism\n\n\"We were very excited and encouraged by our results,\" said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. \"Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer's.\"\n\nDr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).\n\nA Shift in How Alzheimer's Is Viewed\n\nThe findings suggest a fundamental change in how Alzheimer's could be approached in the future. \"The key takeaway is a message of hope -- the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent,\" said Dr. Pieper. \"The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.\"\n\nDr. Chaubey added, \"Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.\"\n\nWhy This Approach Differs From Supplements\n\nDr. Pieper cautioned against confusing this strategy with over the counter NAD+-precursors. He noted that such supplements have been shown in animal studies to raise NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The method used in this research relies instead on P7C3-A20, a pharmacologic agent that helps cells maintain healthy NAD+ balance during extreme stress, without pushing levels beyond their normal range.\n\n\"This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,\" said Dr. Pieper.\n\nNext Steps Toward Human Trials\n\nThe research also opens the door to additional studies and eventual testing in people. The technology is currently being commercialized by Glengary Brain Health, a Cleveland-based company co-founded by Dr. Pieper.\n\n\"This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,\" Dr. Pieper explained. \"Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.\"",

Delivered through a standard IV, it zeroes in on injured brain tissue, calming inflammation and reducing cell death while improving recovery. The peptide worked in both mice and pigs, whose brains are closer to humans in structure. Researchers are now preparing to move toward early human clinical trials.",
      "content": "A global research team led by the company Aivocode, working with scientists from the Institute for Advanced Chemistry of Catalonia (IQAC) of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), reports that a small compound has a strong protective effect in mouse models of traumatic brain injury. The compound is a peptide made from four amino acids called CAQK.\n\nIn animal tests (mice and pigs), researchers gave CAQK through an IV soon after injury. The peptide was drawn to damaged parts of the brain because it is attracted to a protein that becomes unusually abundant in injured tissue after trauma. CAQK built up where this protein was concentrated and helped reduce inflammation, cell death, and harm to brain tissue. In mice, the treatment also improved functional recovery and showed no obvious toxicity.\n\nStudy details and plans for human trials\n\nThe findings were published in EMBO Molecular Medicine and point to new ways to treat injured brain regions. The work was led by Aivocode (a spin-off of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Institute) in San Diego, California, in partnership with IQAC-CSIC and the University of California, Davis.\n\nAivocode was founded by researchers Aman P. Mann, Sazid Hussain, and Erkki Ruoslahti (authors of the study). The company says it plans to seek permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin Phase I clinical trials in humans. No timeline has been announced, but CAQK's small size matters because it is a short peptide that is easier to manufacture and can penetrate tissue well, making it a promising drug candidate.\n\nTraumatic brain injury and the lack of approved drugs\n\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) usually happens after a blow to the head, including injuries from traffic crashes, workplace accidents, or falls. It is estimated to affect around 200 people per 100,000 inhabitants each year. Today's care focuses on keeping patients stable by lowering intracranial pressure and preserving blood flow, yet there are no approved medicines that stop the brain damage itself or the secondary cascade that follows, including inflammation and cell death. Some experimental approaches also require direct injections into the brain, which is invasive and can lead to complications.\n\n\"The current interventions for treating acute brain injury aim to stabilize the patient by reducing intracranial pressure and maintaining blood flow, but there are no approved drugs to stop the damage and secondary effects of these injuries,\" explains Dr. Pablo Scodeller, researcher at IQAC-CSIC and co-author of the study.\n\nA non-invasive approach and a key link to earlier research\n\nDeveloping a non-invasive treatment for an injured brain remains one of neurology's biggest challenges. This study builds on earlier research from 2016 that was published in Nature Communications.\n\nIn that earlier work, researcher Aman P. Mann and Pablo Scodeller, working in Dr. Ruoslahti's lab at Sanford Burnham Prebys (senior author of both studies), identified a peptide that could home in on injured areas of the mouse brain. The peptide, CAQK, was found using peptide-phage display, a large-scale screening method that helps researchers select molecules that bind to specific tissues. At the time, CAQK served mainly as a \"vehicle\" to carry drugs directly to the injured region. The new study shows something more, that CAQK itself can have therapeutic effects.\n\nHow CAQK targets damaged tissue in mice and pigs\n\nTo test whether CAQK could work as a treatment, the team administered it intravenously soon after a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. They then saw the peptide accumulate in injured brain tissue in both mice and pigs (the latter having brains more similar to humans than mice). The researchers also found that CAQK binds to glycoproteins (proteins attached to sugars), which increase after injury and are part of the extracellular matrix -- a supportive structure that surrounds brain cells.\n\nWhen mice with traumatic brain injury received CAQK, their lesion sizes were smaller than those in control mice. \"We observed less cell death and lower expression of inflammatory markers in the injured area, indicating that CAQK alleviated neuroinflammation and its secondary effects. Behavioral and memory tests conducted after treatment also showed improvement in functional deficits, with no evident toxicity,\" explains the study's first author, Dr. Mann.\n\nThe results suggest that CAQK can support repair in damaged brain tissue and may have therapeutic value after trauma. \"What's exciting is that, in addition to proving highly effective, it's a very simple compound -- a short peptide that is easy to synthesize safely at large scale. Peptides with these characteristics show good tissue penetration and are non-immunogenic,\" concludes Scodeller.",

It has not yet been studied in animals or humans. Even so, the findings suggest a promising strategy that takes advantage of vulnerabilities already present in cancer cells.\n\nA Metal Compound With Unusual Properties\n\nThe nanodots are created from molybdenum oxide, a compound derived from molybdenum. This rare metal is commonly used in electronics and industrial alloys.\n\nAccording to the study's lead researcher Professor Jian Zhen Ou and Dr. Baoyue Zhang from RMIT's School of Engineering, small changes to the chemical structure of the particles caused them to release reactive oxygen molecules. These unstable oxygen forms can damage vital cell components and ultimately trigger cell death.\n\nLab Tests Show Strong Cancer Selectivity\n\nIn laboratory experiments, the nanodots killed cervical cancer cells at three times the rate seen in healthy cells over a 24-hour period. Notably, the particles worked without requiring light activation, which is uncommon for similar technologies.\n\n\"Cancer cells already live under higher stress than healthy ones,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"Our particles push that stress a little further -- enough to trigger self-destruction in cancer cells, while healthy cells cope just fine.\"\n\nInternational Collaboration Behind the Research\n\nThe research involved scientists from multiple institutions. Contributors included Dr. Shwathy Ramesan from The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne, as well as researchers from Southeast University, Hong Kong Baptist University, and Xidian University in China. The work was supported by the ARC Centre of Excellence in Optical Microcombs (COMBS).\n\n\"The result was particles that generate oxidative stress selectively in cancer cells under lab conditions,\" she said.\n\nHow the Nanodots Trigger Cell Death\n\nTo create the effect, the team carefully adjusted the composition of the metal oxide by adding very small amounts of hydrogen and ammonium.\n\nThis precise tuning altered how the particles managed electrons, allowing them to produce higher levels of reactive oxygen molecules. These molecules push cancer cells into apoptosis -- the body's natural process for safely removing damaged or malfunctioning cells.\n\nIn a separate experiment, the same nanodots broke down a blue dye by 90 percent in just 20 minutes, demonstrating how powerful their chemical reactions can be even in complete darkness.\n\nA Path Toward Gentler Cancer Treatments\n\nMany existing cancer therapies damage healthy tissue along with tumors. Technologies that can selectively increase stress inside cancer cells may lead to treatments that are more targeted and less harmful.\n\nBecause the nanodots are made from a widely used metal oxide rather than costly or toxic noble metals such as gold or silver, they may also be more affordable and safer to manufacture.\n\nNext Steps Toward Real-World Use\n\nThe COMBS research team at RMIT is continuing to advance the technology. Planned next steps include:\n\nTargeting delivery systems so the particles activate only inside tumors.\n\nControlling release of reactive oxygen species to avoid damage to healthy tissue.\n\nSeeking partnerships with biotech or pharmaceutical companies to test the particles in animal models and develop scalable manufacturing methods.\n\nOrganizations interested in collaborating with RMIT researchers can contact: [email protected]",

En laboratoire, ces particules ont tué les cellules cancéreuses trois fois plus vite que les cellules saines, sans avoir besoin de lumière.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte est importante car elle montre une nouvelle façon de cibler précisément les cellules cancéreuses. Les particules exploitent une faiblesse naturelle des cellules cancéreuses, les poussant à mourir tout en épargnant en grande partie les cellules saines. De plus, le métal utilisé est courant et moins cher que d'autres souvent utilisés dans des technologies similaires.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs prévoient d'améliorer la manière dont les particules atteignent les tumeurs et contrôlent leurs effets pour éviter d'endommager les tissus sains.

      "title": "Your roommate’s genes may be shaping your gut bacteria",
      "summary": "Scientists studying thousands of rats discovered that gut bacteria are shaped by both personal genetics and the genetics of social partners. Some genes promote certain microbes that can spread between individuals living together. When researchers accounted for this social sharing, genetic influence on the microbiome turned out to be much stronger than previously thought. The study suggests genes can affect others indirectly, without DNA ever being exchanged.",
      "content": "The genes of your roommate may be shaping the bacteria in your gut, and your genes may be influencing theirs, according to a rat study published on December 18 in Nature Communications.\n\nBy examining more than four thousand rats, researchers found that the makeup of the gut microbiome is affected not only by an individual's own genetic makeup but also by the genes of the animals they share their living space with.\n\nThe findings point to a new way genetics and social interactions are connected. Certain commensal gut microbes can move between individuals through close contact. While genes themselves stay put, microbes do not. The study showed that some genes promote the growth of specific gut bacteria, and those bacteria can spread socially.\n\n\"This is not magic, but rather the result of genetic influences spilling over to others through social contact. Genes shape the gut microbiome and we found that it is not just our own genes that matter,\" says Dr. Amelie Baud, a researcher at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona and senior author of the study.\n\nThree new gene microbe links identified in rats\n\nThe gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms living in the digestive tract, where they play important roles in digestion and overall health. Diet and medications are known to strongly influence these microbial communities, but understanding how genetics contributes has been far more challenging.\n\nIn humans, researchers have reliably linked only two genes to gut bacteria. The lactase gene determines whether adults can digest milk and affects milk digesting microbes. The ABO blood group gene also influences gut bacteria, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear.\n\nScientists believe additional gene microbe links likely exist, but proving them is difficult because genetic and environmental factors overlap in everyday life. Genes can shape diet and lifestyle choices, which then influence the gut microbiome. At the same time, families and friends often share food, living spaces, and microbes, making it hard to separate nature from nurture.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers at the Centre for Genomic Regulation and the University of California San Diego turned to rats. Rats share many key aspects of mammalian biology and can be raised under tightly controlled conditions, including identical diets.\n\nEach rat in the study was genetically unique and belonged to one of four separate cohorts. These cohorts were housed at different facilities across the United States and followed different care routines, allowing researchers to test whether genetic effects remained consistent across environments.\n\nBy combining genetic data with microbiome profiles from all 4,000 rats, the team identified three genetic regions that consistently influenced gut bacteria across all four cohorts.\n\nThe strongest association involved the gene St6galnac1, which adds sugar molecules to the mucus lining of the gut. This gene was linked to higher levels of Paraprevotella, a bacterium believed to feed on these sugars. This connection appeared in every cohort.\n\nA second genetic region included several mucin genes that help form the gut's protective mucus layer and was associated with bacteria from the Firmicutes group. A third region contained the Pip gene, which produces an antibacterial molecule, and was linked to bacteria from the Muribaculaceae family. These bacteria are common in rodents and are also found in humans.\n\nGenes can have social effects\n\nThe large size of the study allowed researchers, for the first time, to estimate how much of a rat's microbiome was shaped by its own genes versus the genes of the rats it lived with.\n\nA familiar example of this concept, known as indirect genetic effects, occurs when a mother's genes influence her offspring's growth or immune system through the environment she provides.\n\nIn this study, controlled living conditions made it possible to examine indirect genetic effects in a new context. The researchers developed a computational model to separate the influence of a rat's own genes on its gut microbes from the influence of its social partners.\n\nThey found that the abundance of some Muribaculaceae bacteria was shaped by both direct and indirect genetic influences. This indicates that certain genetic effects can spread socially through the exchange of microbes.\n\nWhen these social effects were added to a statistical model, the overall genetic influence on the three newly identified gene microbe links increased by four to eight times. The researchers caution that this may still underestimate the true extent of genetic influence.\n\n\"We've probably only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,\" says Dr. Baud. \"These are the bacteria where the signal is strongest, but many more microbes could be affected once we have better microbiome profiling methods.\"\n\nThe findings describe a mechanism in which genetic effects from one individual can spread through social groups by way of gut microbes, changing the biology of others without altering their DNA.\n\nIf similar processes occur in humans, and given growing evidence that the gut microbiome plays an important role in health, genetic influences on human health may be underestimated in large population studies. Genes may shape not only an individual's disease risk, but also the disease risk of people around them.\n\nWhat the findings could mean for human health\n\nAccording to Dr. Baud, the microbiome has been linked to immune function, metabolism, and behavior. However, many reported associations do not necessarily reflect cause and effect, and the biological mechanisms are often unclear. Genetic studies using animal models in controlled environments can help move beyond correlations to testable explanations of how genes and gut microbes interact in health.\n\nThe researchers note that the rat gene St6galnac1 is functionally related to the human gene ST6GAL1, which has also been linked to Paraprevotella in previous studies. This suggests that the way animals coat their gut mucus with sugars may help determine which microbes thrive in the digestive system, potentially representing a shared mechanism across species.\n\nThe team also explored how this mechanism might influence infectious diseases such as COVID-19.\n\nOther studies have linked ST6GAL1 to breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections, in which vaccinated individuals still become infected. Paraprevotella has also been shown to trigger the breakdown of digestive enzymes that the virus uses to enter host cells. Based on this, the researchers hypothesize that genetic variation in ST6GAL1 could affect Paraprevotella levels and, in turn, susceptibility to viral infection.\n\nThey also suggest a possible link to IgA nephropathy, an autoimmune kidney disease. Paraprevotella may alter IgA, an antibody that normally protects the gut. When altered, IgA can leak into the bloodstream and form clumps that damage the kidneys, which is a defining feature of IgA nephropathy.\n\nNext, the researchers plan to closely examine how St6galnac1 affects Paraprevotella in rats and what chain reactions this relationship triggers in the gut and throughout the body.\n\n\"I am obsessed with this bacterium now. Our results are supported by data from four independent facilities, which means we can do follow up studies in any new setting. They're also remarkably strong compared with most host-microbiome links. It's a unique opportunity,\" Dr. Baud concludes.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long known that gut bacteria, which help with digestion and health, are affected by what we eat and our own genes. But it has been hard to separate the effects of genetics from the environment because people who live together often share food and microbes.\n\n**What happened** – A team of researchers studied over 4,000 genetically unique rats from different labs in the US. They found that a rat’s gut bacteria are shaped not only by its own genes but also by the genes of the rats it lives with. Some genes encourage growth of certain gut microbes that can spread between animals sharing the same space. This means genes can influence others indirectly through social contact.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows that genetic effects on gut bacteria are stronger than previously thought because they include indirect social sharing. It also reveals a new way genes and social behavior connect. For example, a gene called St6galnac1 helps produce sugars in the gut lining that feed a specific bacterium, Paraprevotella, which can spread between roommates. This finding could change how scientists study genetics and health, as genes might affect not just individuals but also the people around them.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will study how St6galnac1 affects Paraprevotella and how this interaction influences health in rats. Since similar genes exist in humans, this could lead to better understanding of diseases like COVID-19 and kidney problems linked to gut bacteria. Future studies may explore how genes and microbes together impact human health and disease risks.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Genes can shape gut bacteria not only inside an individual but also in those they live with, revealing a new layer of genetic influence through social microbial sharing.",
