      "title": "Karnataka’s 2025 Devadasi Abolition Bill and the struggle for dignity in India",
      "summary": "The Karnataka Devadasi Bill, 2025 aims to “conscientize” the public on the issue of getting girls and women dedicated as devadasis by subjecting to liberation from all hues of exploitation.",
      "content": "Entrenched in temple culture and artistic tradition of India, the Devadasi system, where young girls are ritually committed to a deity and projected to serve temples forever, once enjoyed a cultural and artistic status of prestige; however, over the centuries, it has deteriorated into a hereditary system of caste domination, gendered exploitation, and inherited marginalisation. Today, Devadasis are women and girls who are not allowed to enjoy social and legal rights and are also forcibly subjected to lives of sexual servitude in the name of religious sanction.\n\nThe practice continues in many areas, even decades after its legislative prohibition in 1947, which reveals inefficiencies of punitive and symbolic policy that did not reform and also didn’t dismantle the social structures that supported the system. The 2025 Devadasi Abolition Bill by the southwestern Indian state of Karnataka frames itself as a radical change against this strategy and aims to ensure rights, dignity, and agency via participatory reform and not prohibition only.\n\nKey objectives of Karnataka’s 2025 Devadasi Abolition Bill\n\nThe Karnataka Devadasi (Prevention, Prohibition, Relief and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2025, aims to “conscientize” the public on the issue of girls and women being dedicated as devadasis by subjecting them to liberation from all forms of exploitation. The “Principle of conscientisation” guides the entire endeavour for the liberation of the oppressor and the oppressed by raising the public’s awareness around the issue. Awareness campaigns, health and legal education have been envisaged to educate society on this issue and to promote scientific temper and humanism.\n\nContrary to past prohibitive approaches, this law is couched in the language of rights and participation and reconfigures devadasis as not merely passive recipients of state largesse, but as rights-bearers and agents in the policy-making process. What originally was a ritual service was transformed into an institution, since the female became the object of devotion and domination.\n\nChallenges in addressing the Devadasi issue\n\nOne of the major challenges in addressing the Devadasi system is the absence of reliable data on its prevalence. In 2011, the National Commission for Women estimated there were 48,358 Devadasis in India at the time. However, a 2015 Sampark Report submitted to the ILO placed the figure much higher, at nearly 450,000. In Karnataka, surveys by the Karnataka State Women’s Development Corporation (KSWDC) found 22,873 Devadasis in 1993–94 and an additional 23,787 in 2007–08, bringing the total to about 46,660 Devadasis in the state alone.\n\nThe Devadasi system is said to be an ancient socio-religious practice in India, with its presence as early as the 6th century CE. It flourished during the early medieval period, said to be between the 7th and the 12th century, especially in southern India. The foundations of the tradition lay in temple culture; hence, women were offered and dedicated as servitors to deities. They were held in high regard, viewed as embodiments of auspiciousness, freedom, and worship.\n\nTheir religious function was to perform rituals and ceremonies, and to represent culture and the arts to sustain the temple; for example, through classical dance and music which were viewed as a form of worship. As a result of royal patronage and the benevolence of the wealthy classes, they also enjoyed property rights, social esteem, and economic security.\n\nIn recent decades, after being deprived of their traditional roles, many Devadasis were exploited, and the system devolved into one of prostitution and concubinage. In general, they were meant to be socially shamed and pushed aside; however, in some cases, residual rights allowed them to retain control over their earnings or ownership of land.\n\nA patchwork of laws that failed to end the Devadasi system\n\nThe decline of the Devadasi system in India occurred gradually. In hopes of getting their share of justice, laws were enacted post-independence, indicating a regional character to the practice.\n\nOne of the first legal interventions was the Bombay Devadasi Protection Act, 1934, which criminalised the dedication of women, within the existing Devadasi system in what was then the Bombay Presidency (current day Maharashtra, and some parts of Karnataka). Shortly thereafter came the Madras Devadasis (Prevention of Dedication) Act, 1947, which prohibited the system within the borders of what was the Madras Presidency at that time, which broadly covered what is the current-day Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nFollowing independence, states passed additional laws against the Devadasi system. The Karnataka Devadasis (Prohibition of Devotion) Act, 1982, prohibited girls from being devoted to temples and defined punishments for those within temple management who either encouraged or assisted with the practice. Subsequently, the Andhra Pradesh Devadasis (Prohibition of Dedication) Act, 1988, followed suit, prohibiting the system and including provisions to rehabilitate the women. Then came the Maharashtra Devadasi Abolition Act, 2005, which embedded previous legislation and consolidated its laws. These laws were nothing more than a mere prohibition without freedom. The continuation of the practice was a testament to the failure of punitive policy and the need for more profound reform.\n\nThe 2025 bill\n\nThe Bill of 2025 is a break from the norm. It was created with public participation in as more than 15,000 devadasi women, activists, and scholars were consulted throughout the drafting process. One of the many provisions supporting liberation is granting legal identity and dignity to Devadasi children. Children born into the Devadasi institution were traditionally left without the law recognizing their paternal identity and were deprived of inheritance rights due to their lack of documented paternal identity. To correct this injustice, the Bill provides that any child born to a Devadasi woman can ascertain the identity of her father, as the child may approach the taluk Committee to apply for recognition of such a paternal bond. If he denies being the father, the District Court can order DNA testing, and the father’s denial can be treated as a negative inference. The Bill also provides that a child born of a Devadasi woman is presumed to be legitimate and can inherit the mother and father’s property.\n\nThe bill charts the whole path to economic independence and social integration. It grants the right to compensation in the case of housing to all Devadasi families, and prescribes detailed parameters in the case of hygiene, comfort, and privacy, and grants concessions to lesser-benefited remaining family members. Agricultural land will be preferably reserved by the State for the dependents living on agriculture, particularly the registered groups of Devadasis, to push them towards cooperative farming. The Bill realises that rights are not achieved by prohibition, but by replacing the systems of exploitation with dignity, opportunities, and equality.\n\nManjula Malagi, the Devadasi Helpdesk Coordinator at Sakhi Trust, said that the 2025 Devadasi Act is the result of 10 years of advocacy from the Devadasi community.\n\nSaid R. V. Chandrashekar Ramenahalli, of the National Law School of India University’s Centre for the Study of Social Inclusion and Inclusive Policy played a crucial role in getting the Act passed, and called the Act “a holistic and rights-based legislation rooted in constitutional morality.”\n\nThrough the assertion of the right to identity, property, livelihood, and self-determination, the Bill provides a template of reform that is not punitive but transformative, not exclusionary but inclusive.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The Devadasi system is an old tradition in India where young girls were dedicated to temples to serve deities. Though once respected as artists and temple servants, over time it turned into a harmful practice where women faced exploitation and loss of rights. Despite laws against it since 1947, the system still exists in some areas.\n\n**What happened** – In 2025, the Indian state of Karnataka passed a new Devadasi Abolition Bill. Unlike past laws that only banned the system, this law was created with input from over 15,000 Devadasi women and activists. It focuses on raising public awareness, giving Devadasis legal identity, protecting their children’s rights to know their fathers, and providing housing and land support.\n\n**Impact** – This law changes how the problem is addressed by treating Devadasis as people with rights and voices, not just victims. It ensures children born to Devadasis can inherit property and have a recognized family identity. The bill also offers economic help like land for farming and housing compensation, aiming to help these women live with dignity and independence.\n\n**What's next step** – Karnataka will begin implementing the law through public education campaigns, legal aid, and social programs. Other regions might look to this law as a model for reforming similar issues. Continued monitoring will be important to see how well the new approach helps end exploitation and improves lives.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Karnataka’s 2025 Devadasi Abolition Bill moves beyond banning exploitation by empowering Devadasi women and their children with legal rights, social support, and a voice in their future.",

      "summary": "A new season of “Samauryly Ritaiym” — the “samovar dances” — has kicked off in Bashkortostan. These vibrant events draw thousands of participants.",
      "content": "This article first appeared in Novaya Vkladka on June 17, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement.\n\nBashkiria is one of those regions of Russia where the past remains palpably alive. It lingers in the vast steppe landscape, in the melodic intonations of the language, in the way people greet one another, in traditions that have never been relegated to museum shelves. The Indigenous people of the area, the Bashkirs, have for centuries preserved a unique system of clan-based associations, each with its own land, origin legends, and ancestral tamgas — symbols that can still be found in crafts, on flags, and in heraldry.\n\nA Turkic people, the Bashkirs make up the Indigenous population of Bashkortostan — one of the largest ethnic groups in Russia, numbering around 1.6 million. Today, Bashkir identity is experiencing a renewed surge of interest, especially among youth. Some learn the language through online courses, others return to their home villages for the holidays, and some head to ritaiym gatherings in Ufa to hear the kurai (a traditional wind instrument), taste kumis, and feel once again that tradition is not a forgotten chapter of history but a living presence.\n\nA new season of Samauryly Ritaiym — the samovar dances — has kicked off in the capital of Bashkortostan. What began five years ago as an informal gathering of barely a dozen young people on Ufa’s riverfront, sharing tea and music, has since grown into vibrant events that draw more than 2,000 participants. Why have these parties become so compelling to young people, and what makes them a place where people of different ethnic backgrounds come together?\n\nFrom friendly gatherings to a citywide celebration\n\nAlong the Agidel River embankment in Ufa, the soft, resonant notes of the kurai float through the misty air. A large samovar stands beside an improvised stage, while volunteers clear a space for a bonfire. Young women in traditional Bashkir dresses spread a tablecloth, arrange plates of chak-chak, and set bottles of kumis on the table. Some of the young men wear fur-trimmed Bashkir hats with fox tails; others have brought flags of the Republic of Bashkortostan. Despite the light drizzle, people follow the sound of music and within minutes, hundreds of young people have gathered.\n\nTea gatherings around a samovar are a long-standing tradition in Bashkir villages, but scenes like this were once unheard of in the republic’s cities. On June 17, 2020, no more than 15 people showed up for the very first samovar dances along Ufa’s riverfront. “Hosting a tea gathering in an urban setting felt both authentic and full of potential,” recalls Rustam Abdrazakov, one of the initiators of the samovar discos. “I invited my friends and everyone loved it. We lit the samovar, sang songs, danced. Before long, we started meeting more often, and each time the crowd grew larger and larger.”\n\nSamovar gatherings take place on Wednesday evenings every other week. Abdrazakov believes these dance-filled meetups are essential for young people from Bashkir villages who move to Ufa for university and gradually switching to speaking Russian, having grown self-conscious about their native language. Besides, he adds, these events are an excellent way to make friends: “During ritaiym, young people spend three to four hours speaking freely in their native language. Over the past five years, about 12 or 13 couples have formed this way; they now come with their children. Urban Bashkir youth who barely speak the language start to show interest again — in the language, in the culture, in the music.”\n\nIf the first samovar gatherings in Ufa attracted fewer than 50 people, today they draw up to 1,000; sometimes even more. Dance groups, bloggers, and musicians are invited to these tea parties, where residents drink tea, sample beshbarmak, read poetry, and sing both traditional and contemporary songs in the Bashkir language.\n\n“I came back — and fell in love”\n\nAlina Zagidullina, who hails from Ufa, first learned about ritaiym on social media after leaving Russia in 2022. Once she returned, she began attending the gatherings. “I regretted not paying attention to Bashkir culture earlier. Then I came back — and fell in love! I was struck by the fact that people sing not only folk songs but also pick up tracks by contemporary artists. The core value here is, of course, preserving culture and language, because most of the participants are young and they will pass all this on to their children,” she explains.\n\nAnother regular at the samovar parties, Idel Gumerov appreciates the fact that young people have fun without alcohol — and that everything is free. For him, these tea gatherings have become a pleasant pastime that brightens the work week.\n\nReviving old traditions\n\nToday, samovar gatherings are held even in remote towns across Bashkiria, and videos from Ufa’s riverfront rack up thousands of views. Yet, it remains unclear whether these parties receive any government support. The organizers insist the events are funded entirely by donations and dismiss questions about official backing as “provocative.” The regional Ministry of Culture also maintains that it has nothing to do with the samovar discos.\n\n“That’s exactly why everyone comes here, regardless of age or nationality,” surmised Tansulpan Burakaeva, founder of a Bashkir-language study club. “The moment the state takes over this initiative, it will be immediately used for propaganda.”\n\nTo Burakaeva, these dance-filled tea gatherings are a form of nostalgia and a revival of an old tradition: “In Bashkir villages, kis­ke uyn, or külägä, or ritaiym was a traditional event where young people met each other, where everyone could unwind after a long working day — and during wartime or other moments of tragedy, people released their pain through dancing, through typyrlau (stomping dances). That’s why today’s ritaiym, revived by a group of activists, has become so popular.”\n\nNot everyone, however, is thrilled about the energetic dancing in the city. Under posts mentioning Samauyrly Ritaiym in the media, some commenters call the festivities inappropriate in light of ongoing events following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Others counter that “living in a constant atmosphere of war is unbearable — people need some way to take their minds off things.”",

      "content": "Scientists have long tried to uncover the perilous journey humans took to reach the ancient land mass that now makes up Australia. Now, a genetic study has edged us closer to understanding how and when they achieved this\n\nAncient humans took two distinct routes to what is now Australia Helen Farr and Erich Fisher\n\nWhen and how ancient humans reached what is now Australia and New Guinea has been a long – and hotly contested – discussion. Now, the results of a genetic study suggests it occurred at least 60,000 years ago and almost certainly involved two distinct routes.\n\nMainland Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea once made up the giant, ancient continent of Sahul, which existed during glacial maximums when sea levels were lower. For many years, archaeologists have been interested in humanity’s arrival there because, even with lower sea levels, it would have involved treacherous open ocean crossings of at least 100 kilometres.\n\nThere are two main proposals for when they reached Sahul: the first says this occurred at least 60,000 years ago, while the second puts it at around 45,000 years ago.\n\nAs for how they did it, scientists have put forward two possible routes. The first is a southern one that went from what is now the South-East Asian mainland, through the Sunda region – including Malaysia, Indonesia and Timor island – and then by sea to Australia. The second – the northern route, which has more robust evidence supporting it – speculates that humans migrated to what is now New Guinea via the Philippines and Sulawesi, where million-year-old stone tools made by hominins were recently found.\n\nTo get to the bottom of this, Martin Richards at the University of Huddersfield in the UK and his colleagues analysed almost 2500 genome sequences from Indigenous Australians, Papua New Guineans and people from throughout the western Pacific and south-east Asia.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nBy looking at the rate of mutations in the DNA and genetic connections between the populations, the team has concluded that the first settlement of Sahul by humans actually took place via both of the routes, though most used the northern one.\n\nThe researchers may have also put the issue of when this happened to bed. “We dated both dispersals to about the same time – roughly 60,000 years ago,” says Richards. “This supports the so-called ‘long chronology’ for settlement, as opposed to the so-called ‘short chronology’, which suggests settlement around 45,000 to 50,000 years ago.”\n\nThe study also reveals that the migration wasn’t just one way, based partly on the discovery of an ancient New Guinean genetic lineage found in a 1700-year-old Iron Age burial on Sulawesi. In addition, the team uncovered evidence that very soon after reaching Sahul, sea-faring and coastal people made their way to what is now the Solomon Islands.\n\nAdam Brumm at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, says the growing field of palaeogenetics – studying the past through preserved genetic material – means “the story seems to change on a paper-by-paper basis”.\n\n“I think this study offers strong support to the growing idea that the northern route was the key to the initial peopling of Australia,” says Brumm. “This is already becoming increasingly more likely on the basis of our discoveries of very old cave art in Sulawesi, the largest Wallacean island.”\n\nSophisticated rock art here dates to at least 51,200 years ago, says Brumm. “I strongly suspect that people were painting in the caves and shelters of Sulawesi by as long ago as 65,000 years or more.”\n\nPeter Veth at the University of Western Australia in Perth says that even the most conservative estimates at the Madjedbebe site in the Northern Territory of Australia now suggest that signs of human activity date back more than 60,000 years, and the new work adds weight to the earlier arrival of humans into Sahul.\n\nJournal reference: Science Advances DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ady9493",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long wondered how and when the first humans arrived in the area that is now Australia and New Guinea. This region was once a single large landmass called Sahul, and reaching it would have required crossing dangerous seas.\n\n**What happened** – A new genetic study analyzed DNA from nearly 2,500 Indigenous Australians, Papua New Guineans, and people from nearby regions. The research showed that humans arrived in Sahul about 60,000 years ago using two main routes: a northern path through the Philippines and Sulawesi to New Guinea, and a southern path through Indonesia and Timor to Australia. Most people likely used the northern route.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery helps settle a long debate about when humans first settled Sahul, supporting the idea that it happened around 60,000 years ago, earlier than some previous estimates. It also shows that migration was not just one-way; people moved between islands after arriving. The findings are based on strong genetic evidence and connect with other discoveries like ancient tools and cave art, giving a clearer picture of early human history in this part of the world.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will likely continue studying ancient DNA and archaeological sites to learn more about how these early people lived and traveled. Understanding the early movements may also help explain the cultural and genetic diversity among Indigenous groups today.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New genetic evidence reveals that ancient humans reached Australia and New Guinea about 60,000 years ago by two different sea routes, reshaping our understanding of early human migration.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les scientifiques se sont longtemps demandé quand et comment les premiers humains sont arrivés en Australie et en Nouvelle-Guinée, une région qui formait autrefois un grand continent appelé Sahul. Traverser la mer pour y parvenir était dangereux.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Une nouvelle étude génétique a analysé l’ADN de près de 2 500 personnes autochtones d’Australie, de Nouvelle-Guinée et des régions voisines. Elle montre que les humains sont arrivés en Sahul il y a environ 60 000 ans par deux routes principales : une route nord passant par les Philippines et Sulawesi vers la Nouvelle-Guinée, et une route sud passant par l’Indonésie et Timor vers l’Australie. La plupart ont probablement utilisé la route nord.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte aide à résoudre un débat ancien sur la date d’arrivée des humains en Sahul, confirmant une arrivée vers 60 000 ans, plus tôt que certains estiment. Elle montre aussi que les migrations n’étaient pas à sens unique, car les populations ont voyagé entre les îles après leur arrivée. Ces résultats reposent sur des preuves génétiques solides et s’accordent avec des découvertes archéologiques comme des outils anciens et des peintures rupestres.\n\n**Étape suivante** – Les chercheurs vont continuer à étudier l’ADN ancien et les sites archéologiques pour mieux comprendre la vie et les déplacements de ces premiers habitants. Cela pourrait aussi expliquer la diversité culturelle et génétique des peuples autochtones actuels.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – De nouvelles preuves génétiques montrent que les premiers humains ont atteint l’Australie et la Nouvelle-Guinée il y a environ 60 000 ans par deux routes maritimes différentes, changeant notre compréhension des migrations humaines anciennes.\n",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Durante mucho tiempo, los científicos han querido saber cuándo y cómo llegaron los primeros humanos a lo que hoy es Australia y Nueva Guinea, una región que antes formaba un gran continente llamado Sahul. Cruzar el océano para llegar era peligroso.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Un nuevo estudio genético analizó el ADN de casi 2,500 indígenas de Australia, Nueva Guinea y regiones cercanas. La investigación mostró que los humanos llegaron a Sahul hace unos 60,000 años usando dos rutas principales: una ruta norte que pasaba por Filipinas y Sulawesi hacia Nueva Guinea, y una ruta sur que pasaba por Indonesia y Timor hacia Australia. La mayoría usó la ruta norte.\n\n**Impacto** – Este hallazgo ayuda a resolver un debate sobre cuándo se establecieron los humanos en Sahul, apoyando que fue hace unos 60,000 años, antes de lo que algunos pensaban. También muestra que la migración no fue solo en una dirección, porque las personas se movieron entre islas después de llegar. Los resultados se basan en fuertes evidencias genéticas y se relacionan con otros descubrimientos como herramientas antiguas y arte rupestre.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores seguirán estudiando ADN antiguo y sitios arqueológicos para aprender más sobre cómo vivían y viajaban estos primeros humanos. Esto también podría ayudar a entender la diversidad cultural y genética actual de los pueblos indígenas.\n\n**Una frase clave** – Nuevas pruebas genéticas revelan que los primeros humanos llegaron a Australia y Nueva Guinea hace 60,000 años por dos rutas marítimas diferentes, cambiando nuestra comprensión de las migraciones humanas antiguas.\n",

It begins with the transformation of systems, economies, and societies even today and can bring tangible benefits even before formal membership, said Murtezani. (November 26, 2025)",
