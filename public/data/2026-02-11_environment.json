      "summary": "Following a vote by Parliament, the EU will have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% in 2040 compared with 1990 levels, to achieve a climate neutral EU by 2050.Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Source : © European Union, 2026 - EP",
      "content": "On Tuesday MEPs backed a political agreement with Council on amendments to the EU Climate Law by 413 votes to 226 and 12 abstentions, to include a new, intermediate and binding 2040 EU climate target of reducing net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 90% compared to 1990 levels.\n\nFlexibility for member states\n\nThe revised climate law introduces flexibilities in how the 2040-target can be met. From 2036, up to five percentage points of net emissions reductions (two percentage points more than proposed by the Commission) can come from high-quality international carbon credits from partner countries. MEPs included safeguards to prevent the funding of projects contrary to the strategic interests of the EU.\n\nThe text also includes the possibility for domestic permanent carbon removals to be used to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions in the ETS as well as enhanced flexibility within and across sectors and instruments to achieve targets as cost effective as possible, as the green transition and improving EU competitiveness should go hand in hand.\n\nThe introduction of the EU’s ETS2 is also postponed by one year, from 2027 to 2028. ETS2 will cover CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in buildings and road transport.\n\nReview of the 2040 target\n\nThe Commission will assess progress towards the target every second year, in view of up-to-date scientific data, technological developments, and the state of the EU’s industrial competitiveness. It will also consider trends in energy prices and their repercussions for both businesses and households and assess the status of net removals at the EU level compared with what is necessary to meet the 2040 goal.\n\nFollowing the review, the Commission may propose an amendment to the EU climate law, which could involve modifying the 2040 target or taking additional measures to strengthen the supporting framework - for instance to safeguard the EU’s competitiveness, prosperity, and social unity.\n\nNext steps\n\nOnce Council has endorsed the text, it will enter into force 20 days after it has been published in the EU Official Journal.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Climate Law makes the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 a legally binding obligation for all EU member states. It also establishes a legally binding target for the EU to reduce net GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.",

      "personality_title": "EU sets a new law to cut greenhouse gases by 90% by 2040",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union (EU) has a climate law that aims to make the region climate neutral by 2050. This means the EU wants to balance the greenhouse gases it produces with the amount it removes, so there is no net increase in these gases that cause global warming. Before this new law, the EU had to reduce these gases by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.\n\n**What happened** – On Tuesday, the European Parliament agreed to update the climate law. They voted 413 in favor, 226 against, and 12 abstained. The update sets a new goal: by 2040, the EU must cut its net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to 1990. This target is legally binding, meaning every EU country must follow it.\n\n**Impact** – This new goal is very ambitious and important because it pushes the EU closer to its 2050 climate neutrality plan. The law also allows some flexibility. For example, starting in 2036, countries can use special international carbon credits to meet part of their targets. These credits come from projects in other countries that reduce emissions. The law makes sure these projects support the EU’s interests. It also allows using technology that removes carbon from the air to help reach the target. The law delays a new system called ETS2, which will control emissions from buildings and road transport, by one year to 2028.\n\n**What's next step** – The EU Council still needs to approve the updated law. Once it does, the law will officially start 20 days after being published in the EU’s official journal. The European Commission will check every two years on how well the EU is doing toward the 2040 goal. Based on these checks, the Commission can suggest changes if needed to keep the EU competitive and united while fighting climate change.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU has made a strong legal commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, marking a major step toward a climate-neutral future.\n",

La mise à jour fixe un nouvel objectif : d'ici 2040, l'UE doit réduire de 90 % ses émissions nettes de gaz à effet de serre par rapport à 1990. Cet objectif est juridiquement contraignant, ce qui signifie que chaque pays de l'UE doit le respecter.\n\n**Impact** – Cet objectif est très ambitieux et important car il rapproche l'UE de son plan de neutralité climatique pour 2050. La loi offre aussi une certaine flexibilité. Par exemple, à partir de 2036, les pays pourront utiliser des crédits carbone internationaux spéciaux pour atteindre une partie de leurs objectifs. Ces crédits proviennent de projets dans d'autres pays qui réduisent les émissions. La loi veille à ce que ces projets soutiennent les intérêts de l'UE. Elle permet aussi l'utilisation de technologies qui retirent le carbone de l'air pour aider à atteindre l'objectif. La loi reporte d'un an, à 2028, un nouveau système appelé ETS2, qui contrôlera les émissions des bâtiments et des transports routiers.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le Conseil de l'UE doit encore approuver la loi mise à jour. Une fois cela fait, la loi entrera en vigueur 20 jours après sa publication au Journal officiel de l'UE. La Commission européenne vérifiera tous les deux ans les progrès vers l'objectif 2040.

      "title": "Scientists uncover the climate shock that reshaped Easter Island",
      "summary": "Around 1550, life on Rapa Nui began changing in ways long misunderstood. New research reveals that a severe drought, lasting more than a century, dramatically reduced rainfall on the already water-scarce island, reshaping how people lived, worshiped, and organized society. Instead of collapsing, Rapanui communities adapted—shifting rituals, power structures, and sacred spaces in response to climate stress.",
      "content": "New research from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory provides the strongest evidence so far that a prolonged drought reshaped life on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) starting around the year 1550. To uncover this history, scientists extracted sediment cores from two of the island's limited freshwater sites: Rano Aroi, a wetland high in elevation, and Rano Kao, a crater lake. These sediments preserve natural chemical signals that record past environmental conditions.\n\nBy studying the hydrogen isotope makeup of plant leaf waxes preserved in the sediments, the researchers reconstructed rainfall patterns stretching back 800 years. Their results show that annual rainfall dropped sharply in the mid-16th century and stayed low for more than 100 years. Rather than pointing to a sudden societal breakdown, the findings suggest that Rapanui communities adapted and persisted despite severe and lasting climate stress. Lead author Redmond Stein explained how the team traced this hidden climate history and why it matters for understanding the relationship between environment and culture.\n\nReading Ancient Rainfall in Lake Sediments\n\nLakes and wetlands slowly accumulate layers of sediment over centuries, locking in clues about the climate at the time each layer formed. Earlier studies on Rapa Nui relied on indicators such as pollen, plant remains, elemental chemistry, and how quickly sediments built up to infer past environmental changes. While these methods are useful, they can be influenced by several factors at once, including temperature, rainfall, and human land use.\n\nLeaf waxes offer a more direct signal. On Rapa Nui, these waxes appear to reflect local rainfall and dryness more clearly than other indicators. By examining their chemical makeup -- the balance between \"heavy\" and \"light\" hydrogen in the waxes mirrors the hydrogen composition of rainwater absorbed by plants -- the team was able to estimate the severity of drought conditions. This approach allowed researchers to calculate the scale of the 16th century drought on Rapa Nui for the first time.\n\nHow Severe Was the Drought and What Changed?\n\nThe analysis indicates that rainfall declined by about 600-800mm (24-31 inches) per year compared with the previous three centuries. This extended dry period overlaps with notable cultural changes on the island. During this time, construction of ceremonial \"ahu\" platforms slowed, Rano Kao became a key ritual center, and a new social system known as \"Tangata Manu\" emerged. Under this system, leadership could be earned through athletic competition rather than inherited through family lines connected to the moai statues.\n\nArcheologists continue to debate the exact timing and causes of these shifts, and it remains difficult to link specific events directly to climate change. Still, the evidence shows that the island's social and geographic organization looked very different after the drought began than it had before.\n\nRethinking the \"Ecocide\" Story\n\nFor decades, Rapa Nui has often been cited as an example of self-inflicted environmental collapse. The so-called ecocide narrative argues that deforestation led to conflict and population decline before Europeans arrived in the 18th century, turning the island into a cautionary tale about overconsumption. While it is true that Rapa Nui experienced widespread deforestation, many studies now question whether this led to societal collapse. There is little evidence for a sharp drop in population before European contact.\n\nThis new study adds climate context to that debate. Evidence suggests that island residents were already coping with worsening drought conditions from the 16th century onward, a serious challenge on an island with scarce freshwater. The researchers are not arguing that climate alone drove social change or that deforestation played no role. Instead, they emphasize that shifts in rainfall likely shaped how people responded to environmental pressures. The precise effects remain uncertain -- for example, reduced rainfall may have increased soil erosion, limited drinking water, forced people to seek new water sources, or hindered plant growth. Taken together, the findings show that Rapa Nui's history is far more complex than the ecocide narrative suggests.\n\nLessons for a Changing Climate\n\nOne clear takeaway from Rapa Nui's past is human resilience. However, the researchers stress that modern discussions about climate change should prioritize the voices of people living on Rapa Nui and other Pacific islands today. These communities are already experiencing climate impacts firsthand, and their knowledge is more directly relevant to present challenges than lessons drawn from ancient history. The goal of this research is not to create a new warning story for the modern world, but to replace an oversimplified one.\n\nWhat Comes Next for the Research\n\nThe team is now working with a much longer leaf wax isotope record from Rano Aroi that spans roughly 50,000 years. This extended timeline could reveal how atmospheric circulation in the southeast Pacific has responded to climate shifts over tens of thousands of years. Rapa Nui sits deep in this remote region, more than 3,000 kilometers from the coast of Chile and over 1,500 kilometers from the nearest inhabited island.\n\nBecause it is the only significant source of land-based sediment in the area, Rapa Nui offers a rare window into past atmospheric behavior. Scientists still have limited understanding of what controls weather patterns in the southeast Pacific, and current climate models do not capture them well. The new record could provide valuable insight into how regional climate systems have changed over long periods of time.",

      "title": "Geothermal could replace almost half of the EU’s fossil fuel power",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "If you’ve ever been to a hot spring or geyser or volcano, you’ve seen the future of energy. Earth’s innards are hot — really hot — and that heat sometimes bubbles to the surface. If engineers dig holes in these geologically active places, then pipe water through rock, they can tap into this geothermal energy. Whereas solar and wind require sunlight and gusts to produce electricity, the Earth itself provides this constant source of fuel, which provides a powerful technique for bolstering the grid.\n\nA new report from the energy think tank Ember underscores geothermal’s potential, finding that it could theoretically replace 42 percent of the European Union’s electricity generation from coal and natural gas — and at the same cost. New technologies could help Europe keep pace with the United States and Canada by opening new regions and exploiting this abundant, clean energy supply, the report adds. “We can’t really say that all of it will be utilized, but there is enough of it to get policymakers and investors more interested, even in Europe and even outside of traditional hot spots,” said Tatiana Mindeková, a policy advisor at Ember and lead author of the report.\n\nAbout those hot spots. Historically, geothermal has been limited to geologically active places. That is, if the Earth isn’t hot near the surface, you’d have to dig farther to get at the energy. And the deeper you dig, the higher the costs and the harder it is to recoup that investment. In addition, the rock at these sites must be permeable: A facility pumps down liquid, which flows through the gaps and heats up, then returns to the surface to power a turbine.\n\nBut next-generation techniques are opening swaths of new territories to exploit. Engineers are drilling deeper, allowing them to tap into the constant heat emanating from the planet’s molten core. And they’re creating their own permeability by fracturing rock at depth, so the water has space to heat up. “With these new technologies, we actually can extend the scope of where geothermal makes sense economically,” Mindeková said.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nThis is not to say that these techniques, known as enhanced or advanced geothermal, are cheap or easy. As crews drill deeper, the equipment on the surface must scale up to handle the load. We’re talking depths of several miles. “Anytime you get deeper, it gets more difficult,” said Wayne Bezner Kerr, who manages the Earth Source Heat program at Cornell University but wasn’t involved in the report. “It gets more expensive, it gets more challenging.”\n\nOddly enough, tools and techniques developed by the oil and gas industry have helped massively here, opening pathways in a geothermal system. That creates more surface area for the water to move across and heat up. “It is a bit ironic,” Mindeková said, “and I feel like it’s also maybe one of the reasons why we don’t talk about [geothermal] in Europe as much.”\n\nWhich is not to say that geothermal can now be done economically everywhere. One major consideration is the geothermal gradient — how quickly temperature rises the deeper you go: Rock may be the desired temperature two miles below the surface in one place, but just one mile deep in another place. The cost and complexity of drilling fall if things are hotter near the surface. Geology also matters: Water can be lost as it’s pumped underground — which becomes a problem if you’re drilling in an area without access to a lot of surface water to replace. Certain types of rock also infuse that water with more minerals, which can interfere with the equipment aboveground.\n\nStill, like any technology, efficiency will increase and expense will decrease as more geothermal comes online. “To the extent that we see more deployment of advanced geothermal in Europe, we’re going to see that bring down the cost of applying the innovation in lots of other places in the world,” said David Victor, co-director of the Deep Decarbonization Initiative at the University of California, San Diego, who wasn’t involved in the report.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nReally, though, we don’t need to drill deep to get major energetic gains from the Earth. In the EU, the average household uses more than three quarters of its energy on home and water heating. A new geothermal project could generate electricity to meet that demand or, alternatively, a shallower project could heat and cool those homes more directly.\n\nThis is known as networked geothermal: A utility drills maybe 600 or 700 feet deep and pipes water through the ground, which maintains a fairly constant temperature at that depth throughout the year. That heated H2O flows to individual homes, where ultra-efficient heat pumps extract warmth from the liquid in the winter and inject the cooled water back underground to heat again. Then in the summer, the heat pumps pull warmth from indoor air and add it to the water, which is pumped underground once more. This heats up the subterranean rock, so it’s ready to provide warmth once winter rolls back around.\n\nSimilarly, geothermal can complement wind and solar by turning the ground into a giant battery. When the wind is blowing and the sun is shining, a facility uses that energy to heat water and pump it underground. Then when those renewables aren’t available, the hot water is pumped back up, discharging the subterranean battery.\n\nThe future for geothermal, then, is looking hot. And ironically enough, it’ll be advances from the oil and gas industry that will help the technology grow — in the EU and beyond. “We are trying to highlight,” Mindeková said, “that it’s also an opportunity for people working in these sectors to just transfer the knowledge, the skills, and find future employment in this new sector.”",

      "content": "Electric vehicle batteries are typically retired once they reach about 80 per cent of their original capacity, but they could be repurposed in electricity grids to balance out slumps in renewable generation\n\nA vehicle battery factory in Guangxi, China Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nUsed electric vehicle batteries could meet two-thirds of China’s grid storage needs, charging up when renewable energy is plentiful and disbursing electricity when demand outstrips supply.\n\nRenewable energy generation slackens when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, which can lead to a shortage at times of peak demand, like mornings and evenings and the winter months. Gas and coal plants typically fill that gap. But countries like China, the US, the UK and Australia are building huge amounts of grid storage based on batteries that can save renewable energy for later use.\n\nAs EVs become more common, batteries from dismantled cars could be plugged into the grid to achieve a carbon-neutral power system more quickly and cheaply, argue Ruifei Ma at Tsinghua University in China and colleagues. These second-life batteries could meet 67 per cent of the Chinese grid’s storage demand by 2050, while cutting costs by 2.5 per cent, according to their study.\n\nEV batteries degrade as they are charged and discharged over the years, and they are typically retired once they reach about 80 per cent of their original capacity. While that degradation diminishes a car’s range and acceleration, it has little impact on a grid storage system, where hundreds or thousands of batteries are being charged and discharged over many hours.\n\n“There’s still plenty of power left in them, and used as storage, they tend not to degrade as quickly,” says Gill Lacey at Teesside University, UK.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“We shouldn’t be throwing away these materials that cost a lot of money to mine and process and turn into batteries when we’ve got 80 per cent usable capacity left in the cells,” says Rhodri Jervis at University College London. “So, there’s a lot of desire to use retired battery packs in second-life applications from a cost-saving point of view, but I think probably more importantly from a sustainability point of view.”\n\nPrevious research has come to different conclusions about whether energy storage based on used batteries would be cheaper than new lithium-ion batteries, which have been falling in price.\n\nBut used batteries are likely to become more economical as increasing numbers of EVs come off the road. More than 17 million EVs were purchased in 2024, or about 20 per cent of all car sales, and almost two-thirds of them were bought in China.\n\nThe study found that in a scenario where batteries with different chemistries are sourced across all of China and deployed until they are at 40 per cent of their original capacity, second-life grid storage starts to grow ever more rapidly after 2030, while new batteries plateau. Total capacity would reach 2 trillion watts by 2050.\n\nIn a scenario in which grid storage relies on new batteries and pumped hydro — where water pumped into a reservoir flows downhill to drive a turbine — total capacity only reaches about half of that.\n\nWhile second-life battery storage is still largely untested, the US start-up Redwood Materials has built a 63-megawatt-hour project out of decade-old car batteries for a data centre in Nevada. It claims its systems cost less than $150 per kilowatt-hour and can deliver power for over 24 hours, far longer than new lithium-ion batteries can realistically offer.\n\nBut used batteries need to be screened and grouped into units of similar capacity. Alternatively, the management system must be able to bypass individual batteries. Otherwise, the whole group will have to stop charging as soon as the most degraded battery reaches its capacity.\n\nDamaged batteries must be screened out, too, and those that make the cut must have temperature and voltage sensors for each of their hundreds of cells. If a cell overheats, it can cause a massive, inextinguishable fire.\n\n“Clearly the risks are higher, so you need to mitigate those with your safety and isolation and balancing and all the rest of it being more robust,” says Lacey.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Electric vehicle (EV) batteries are usually replaced when they lose about 20% of their power. Normally, these batteries are thrown away, but they still hold enough energy to be useful in other ways.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers in China found that old EV batteries can be reused to store electricity for the power grid. This means they can charge when there is extra energy from wind or solar power and release it when people need more electricity. The study says these second-life batteries could supply about two-thirds of China’s energy storage needs by 2050.\n\n**Impact** – Using old EV batteries helps store renewable energy more cheaply and reduces waste from discarded batteries. Although the batteries have less power than new ones, they work well for the grid because many batteries are combined and used over longer times. This reuse could cut costs and speed up the switch to cleaner energy.\n\n**What's next step** – The technology still needs testing and safety checks to make sure used batteries are safe and reliable. Companies like Redwood Materials in the US are already building projects with old batteries. If successful, this approach could grow quickly after 2030 as more EVs reach the end of their first life.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Old electric car batteries can be reused to store renewable energy, helping China build a cheaper and cleaner power system by 2050.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les batteries des véhicules électriques (VE) sont généralement remplacées lorsqu’elles perdent environ 20 % de leur capacité. Habituellement, ces batteries sont jetées, mais elles contiennent encore assez d’énergie pour être réutilisées.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs chinois ont découvert que les batteries usagées de VE peuvent être réutilisées pour stocker de l’électricité dans le réseau. Elles peuvent se recharger lorsque l’énergie solaire ou éolienne est abondante et fournir de l’électricité quand la demande est forte. L’étude indique que ces batteries de seconde vie pourraient couvrir environ deux tiers des besoins de stockage d’énergie de la Chine d’ici 2050.\n\n**Impact** – Réutiliser ces batteries aide à stocker l’énergie renouvelable à moindre coût et réduit les déchets. Même si elles ont moins d’énergie que les batteries neuves, elles fonctionnent bien pour le réseau car beaucoup de batteries sont regroupées et utilisées sur de longues périodes. Cette solution pourrait réduire les coûts et accélérer la transition vers une énergie plus propre.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – La technologie doit encore être testée et sécurisée pour garantir la fiabilité des batteries usagées. Des entreprises comme Redwood Materials aux États-Unis construisent déjà des projets avec ces batteries. Si cela fonctionne, cette méthode pourrait se développer rapidement après 2030, avec l’augmentation du nombre de VE en fin de vie.\n\n**En une phrase** – Les batteries usagées de voitures électriques peuvent être réutilisées pour stocker l’énergie renouvelable, aidant la Chine à construire un système électrique moins cher et plus propre d’ici 2050.",

Normalmente, estas baterías se desechan, pero todavía tienen suficiente energía para usarse de otra forma.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigadores en China descubrieron que las baterías usadas de VE pueden reutilizarse para almacenar electricidad en la red eléctrica. Pueden cargarse cuando hay energía extra de viento o sol y descargarla cuando se necesita más electricidad. El estudio dice que estas baterías de segunda vida podrían cubrir cerca de dos tercios de las necesidades de almacenamiento de energía de China para 2050.\n\n**Impacto** – Usar baterías usadas ayuda a almacenar energía renovable de forma más barata y reduce los residuos. Aunque tienen menos energía que las nuevas, funcionan bien para la red porque muchas baterías se combinan y usan durante más tiempo.
