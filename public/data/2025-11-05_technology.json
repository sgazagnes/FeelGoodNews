      "content": "Stone tool discovery suggests very first humans were inventors\n\n18 hours ago Share Save Pallab Ghosh Science Correspondent Share Save\n\nDavid Braun They look like simple stones, but they were state of the art tools millions of years ago, made with great skill and precison\n\nThe very first humans millions of years ago may have been inventors, according to a discovery in northwest Kenya. Researchers have found that the primitive humans who lived 2.75 million years ago at an archaeological site called Namorotukunan used stone tools continuously for 300,000 years. Evidence previously suggested that early human tool use was sporadic: randomly developed and quickly forgotten. The Namorotukunan find is the first to show that the technology was passed down through thousands of generations.\n\nAccording to Prof David Braun, of George Washington University, in Washington DC, who led the research, this find, published in the journal Nature Communications, provides incredibly strong evidence for a radical shake-up in our understanding of human evolution. \"We thought that tool use could have been a flash in the pan and then disappeared. When we see 300,000 years of the same thing, that's just not possible,\" he said. \"This is a long continuity of behaviour. That tool use in (humans and human ancestors) is probably much earlier and more continuous than we thought it was.\"\n\nDavid Braun The stone tools were so sharp that the researchers could cut their fingers on some of them\n\nArchaeologists spent ten years at Namorotukunan uncovering 1,300 sharp flakes, hammerstones, and stone cores, each made by carefully striking rocks gathered from riverbeds. These are made using a technology known as Oldowan and is the first widespread stone tool-making method. The same kinds of tools appear in three distinct layers. The deeper the layer the further back the snapshot in time. Many of the stones were specially chosen for their quality, suggesting that the makers were skilled and knew exactly what they were looking for, according to the senior geoscientist on the research team, Dr Dan Palcu Rolier of the University of São Paulo in Brazil. \"What we see here in the site is an incredible level of sophistication,\" he told BBC News. \"These guys were extremely astute geologists. They knew how to find the best raw materials and these stone tools are exceptional. Basically, we can cut our fingers with some of them.\" Geological evidence suggests that tool use probably helped these people survive dramatic changes in climate. The landscape shifted from lush wetlands to dry, fire-swept grasslands and semideserts,\" said Rahab N. Kinyanjui, senior scientist at the National Museums of Kenya.\n\nThese sharp environmental changes would normally force animal populations to adapt through evolution or move away. But the toolmakers in the region managed to thrive by using technology rather than biological adaptation, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. \"Technology enabled these early inhabitants of East Turkana to survive in a rapidly changing landscape - not by adapting themselves, but adapting their ways of finding food.\" The evidence of stone tools at different layers shows that for a long and continuous period, these primitive people flew in the face of biological evolution, finding a way of controlling the world around them, rather than letting the world control them. And this happened at the very beginning of the emergence of humanity, according to Dr Palcu Rolier. \"Tool use meant that they did not have to evolve by modifying their bodies to adapt to these changes. Instead, they developed the technology they needed to get access to the food: tools for ripping open animal carcasses and digging up plants.\"\n\nDavid Braun The Namorotukunan site, located in Kenya's Turkana Basin, lies close to the ancient course of a long dried up major river which once attracted settlements of early humans and their ancestors\n\nThere is evidence for this at the site: of animal bones being broken, being cut with these stone tools, which means that through these changes, they were consistently able to use meat as a way of sustenance. \"The technology gives these early inhabitants an advantage, says Dr Palcu Rolier. \"They are able to access different types of foods as environments change, their source of sustenance is changing, but because they have this technology, they can bypass these challenges and access new food.\"\n\nDavid Braun Archaeologists excavate a 2.58 million year old site in northern Kenya at the site of Namorotukunan",

      "title": "Ancient fish with human-like hearing stuns scientists",
      "summary": "Long ago, some saltwater fish adapted to freshwater — and in doing so, developed an extraordinary sense of hearing rivaling our own. By examining a 67-million-year-old fossil, researchers from UC Berkeley discovered that these “otophysan” fish didn’t evolve their sensitive Weberian ear system in rivers, as long thought, but rather began developing it in the ocean before migrating inland. This new timeline suggests two separate invasions of freshwater, explaining why so many freshwater species exist today.",
      "content": "When some marine fish eventually adapted to life in fresh water, many also acquired a more elaborate way to hear, including middle ear bones that resemble those in humans.\n\nTwo-thirds of freshwater species today rely on a specialized middle ear known as the Weberian apparatus. This group spans more than 10,000 species, from catfish to aquarium favorites such as tetras and zebrafish. The Weberian system lets them detect much higher sound frequencies than most ocean fish, reaching a range close to human hearing.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley paleontologist Juan Liu examined the Weberian apparatus in a newly described fossil fish and used its anatomy to update the timeline for how freshwater fish evolved.\n\nFossil evidence revises the timeline\n\nOtophysan fish, which possess a Weberian ear system, were long believed to have entered fresh water roughly 180 million years ago, before Pangea split into the continents we recognize today. Liu's work points to a later origin, about 154 million years ago in the late Jurassic Period, after Pangea had begun to break apart and as modern oceans were taking shape.\n\nAnalyses of fossils and genomic data indicate that precursors of the enhanced hearing bones first appeared while these fish still lived in the sea. Fully refined, sensitive hearing evolved after two separate lineages colonized fresh water: one that led to catfish, knife fish, and African and South American tetras, and another that produced carp, suckers, minnows, and zebrafish, the largest order of freshwater fish.\n\n\"The marine environment is the cradle of a lot of vertebrates,\" said Liu, an assistant adjunct professor of integrative biology and an assistant curator in the UC Museum of Paleontology. \"A long time consensus was that these bony fish had a single freshwater origin in the large continent Pangea and then dispersed with the separation of different continents. My team's analysis of some fantastic fossils that shed new light on the evolutionary history of freshwater fish and found completely different results: the most recent common ancestor of otophysan fish was a marine lineage and there were at least two freshwater incursions after that lineage split up.\"\n\nThis reinterpretation reshapes how scientists view both the evolutionary history and the complex biogeography of this remarkably successful freshwater group, she added. \"These repeated incursions into freshwater at the early divergence stage likely accelerated speciation, and are key factors in explaining the extraordinary hyper-diversity of otophysans in modern freshwater faunas.\"\n\nLiu and her colleagues describe and name the 67 million-year-old fossil fish, Acronichthys maccagnoi, in a paper published on October 2 in the journal Science. In that paper, the researchers analyze 3D scans of the fossil's Weberian structure and the genomes and morphology of modern fish to revise the genealogy of freshwater fish, and also simulate the frequency response of the fossil fish's middle ear structure.\n\nHow underwater hearing works\n\nHearing in water relies on different structures than hearing in air. Many land vertebrates detect sound with an eardrum that vibrates and drives a chain of middle ear bones that amplify the signal before it reaches the fluid-filled inner ear; in humans these bones are the malleus, incus, and stapes.\n\nBecause a fish's body is close in density to water, sound waves pass through it. Many fish therefore evolved an internal air bladder that vibrates with passing sounds. In most saltwater species, vibrations reach the inner ear only weakly, which limits hearing to low frequencies below about 200 Hertz.\n\nOtophysan fish improved this pathway by adding small bony \"ossicles\" that connect the air bladder, often mistakenly called the swim bladder, to the inner ear. This linkage boosts and broadens hearing sensitivity. Zebrafish, for instance, can detect sounds up to 15,000 Hz, approaching the 20,000 Hz upper limit in humans.\n\nWhy high-frequency hearing is useful remains an open question. It may reflect the variety of habitats these fish occupy, from fast streams to still lakes.\n\nLiu studies the Weberian apparatus in living and fossil fish, and last year published a computational simulation of how the apparatus works. That simulation allows her to predict the frequency response of the bony ossicles, and thus the hearing sensitivity of fish.\n\nA tiny Alberta fossil with outsized insight\n\nNumerous specimens of the newly named fossil fish, a mere 2 inches long, were excavated and collected in Alberta, Canada, over six field seasons starting in 2009 by ichthyologist and co-author Michael Newbrey of Columbus State University in Georgia. The fossils are housed in the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta. A couple of specimens were so well preserved that the bones in the middle ear were clearly Weberian. The fish is the oldest known North American fossil of an otophysan fish, or Otophysi, dating from the late Cretaceous Period, only a short time before the non-avian dinosaurs disappeared. Older specimens have been found elsewhere in the world, but none had a well-preserved Weberian apparatus, Liu said.\n\nTechnicians with the Canadian Light Source at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon and at McGill University in Montreal captured 3D X-ray scans of the fish, and Liu modeled the ossicles of the Weberian apparatus in her laboratory. The model suggests that, even 67 million years ago, otophysan fish had nearly as sensitive hearing as zebrafish do today.\n\n\"We weren't sure if this was a fully functional Weberian apparatus, but it turns out the simulation worked,\" Liu said. \"The Weberian apparatus has just a little bit lower output power, which means lower sensitivity, compared to a zebrafish. But the peak, the most sensitive frequency, is not too much lower than zebrafish -- between 500 and 1,000 Hertz -- which is not too bad at all and which means the higher frequency hearing should have been achieved in this old otophysan fish.\"\n\nWhat this means for evolution and diversity\n\nThe results underscore a broader pattern in evolution: bursts of new species often follow repeated entries into new habitats, especially when organisms evolve innovations such as more sensitive hearing.\n\n\"For a long time, we presumed that the Otophysi probably had a freshwater origin because this group consisted almost exclusively of freshwater fishes,\" Newbrey said. \"The new species provides crucial information for a new interpretation of the evolutionary pathways of the Otophysi with a marine origin. It just makes so much more sense.\"\n\nOther coauthors of the paper are Donald Brinkman of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, Alison Murray of the University of Alberta, former UC Berkeley undergraduate Zehua Zhou, now a graduate student at Michigan State University, and Lisa Van Loon and Neil Banerjee of Western University in London, Ontario. Liu was funded by a Franklin Research Grant from the American Philosophical Society.",

      "content": "A course in disruptive innovation helped to cement João Paulo Longo’s science-entrepreneur ambitions.Credit: Victor Carlos Mello Da Silva\n\nWhile earning his dentistry degree at the University of Brasilia, João Paulo Longo joined Brazil’s Institutional Scientific Initiation Scholarship Programme (PIBIC), which gives undergraduates the opportunity to join research projects. The experience ignited a passion for research that led him to quit dentistry and pursue a PhD, during which a cosmetics company director sought his help in product development.\n\nThese early career experiences, alongside a course on disruptive innovation at Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts, cemented his ambition to be a science entrepreneur.\n\nLongo is now a nanotechnology researcher at the University of Brasilia, a role he combines with his position as a founder and researcher at Glia Innovation, a cosmetics business in Goiânia.\n\nYou pivoted from dentistry to nanotechnology. How and why did that happen?\n\nI worked as a dentist for three years after graduating, but my earlier involvement in the PIBIC, which I took part in in as an undergraduate in 2003, inspired me to start a research career and to undertake both a master’s and a PhD.\n\nMy doctoral research was on the application of a photodynamic therapy — a drug activated by light — to treat oral infection in a 12-participant clinical study. It gave me an understanding of how to use basic science to solve practical problems. At that time, translational medicine, the practice of taking scientific discoveries from the laboratory to clinical settings to benefit human health, was not widespread in Brazil.\n\nWhat led you to combine academia and entrepreneurship?\n\nIn 2010, two years into my PhD programme, I was invited by Leila Velez, a founder of Beleza Natural, a cosmetics company in Rio de Janeiro, to develop nanotechnology products, including nanostructured oils developed from biodiverse sources in Brazil. I was recommended by a friend working at the Brazilian National Confederation of Industry in Brasilia. It was an improbable relationship because, at that time, my field was nanotechnology and dentistry. We adapted some technologies for the cosmetics field.\n\nFive years on, I was in an academic role, teaching nanobiotechnology at the University of Brasilia and feeling unfulfilled in my career. Eureka moments were rare, as were opportunities to apply scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems. I felt that academia had grown increasingly competitive: success was tied to metrics, rather than to the practical application of knowledge, and researchers were judged mainly on publication numbers.\n\nSo, in 2018, I enrolled in the Academia-Industry Training programme, a joint initiative between the Brazilian and Swiss governments supported by Brazil’s National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and SwissNex, a global network aimed at strengthening Switzerland’s profile as an innovation hotspot. The programme taught me about innovation concepts, such as minimum viable products (MVPs). These are the most basic versions of new products and are released to customers to garner feedback.\n\nI deepened my understanding of innovation through an online course at the Harvard Business School, focused on disruptive strategy and innovation. It was led by Clay Christensen, a business consultant and academic who developed the theory of disruptive innovation — in which a product or service gradually displaces established competitors after starting at the bottom of the market.\n\nI was spending a lot of time interacting with science entrepreneurs and attending industry events, where I first learnt about a problem faced by cosmetics companies in Brazil. They were importing nanoparticles used for the dermal delivery of active ingredients. One company’s German supplier imposed a minimum supply quantity of 50 kilograms. In 2018, Cosmefar, a firm in Aparecida De Goiania, Brazil, contracted me to produce smaller quantities, after a mutual friend introduced me to its co-founder, pharmacist Guilherme Alves Ferreira.\n\nAfter working on this project and others, I set up Nanoceuticals in 2018 with Nichollas Camargo, a chemist at the University of Brasilia. The company develops nanoparticles for cosmetics, health and pharmaceutical products. It was a low-risk venture, in that we were not depending on venture capital. Instead, we used our own resources, revenue and personal funding to operate and scale up, growing client by client.\n\nHow did the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath affect the business?\n\nWe were starting to expand the team, when our sales suddenly dropped to zero. We innovated by using our technology to develop a polymer to replace Carbopol, the key ingredient in alcohol-based hand gels. It had almost sold out across Brazil. We generated the equivalent of one year’s revenue in four weeks, before Carbopol came back into supply.\n\nAs the company expanded, we wanted to get broader expertise in peptide science, because of its key function in human health (peptides are short chains of amino acids that serve as the building blocks of protein).\n\nIn 2022, Nanoceuticals merged with Plateinnove Biotechnology, a start-up in Campinas founded five years earlier by molecular biologist Sheila Siqueira Andrade. We named it Glia Innovations, inspired by Glial cells, which are key in supporting neural function — symbolizing the creation of new ideas.\n\nThe merger was on an all-share basis, whereby the target company’s owners are paid in the acquiring company’s shares, with no cash involved.\n\nAfter the merger, we rapidly scaled up and began clinical trials in Brazil, including ones for anti-wrinkle and tooth-whitening treatments. We serve more than 80 cosmetics-industry clients in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, the United States, Indonesia, South Korea and India.\n\nHow do your students benefit from your entrepreneurial background?\n\nI combine my Glia position with my academic post, and see my role as a link between research and innovation and industry. The university runs innovation and entrepreneurship courses for undergraduate and graduate students. All my lectures are based on translating science into real-world benefit with the potential to commercialize.\n\nFour new start-up companies were created last year, and three students have collaborated with corporations, developing new patents and creating products for diverse industries. One company is called Cooil, which uses nanotechnology to develop final cosmetic products. Another is BioDev, a software company specializing in custom-made digital solutions using artificial intelligence for the scientific community.\n\nYou could say that we are shaping a generation of science entrepreneurs.\n\nHow does Glia embody disruptive innovation?",

      "content": "Building a working quantum internet would require overcoming a host of technical challenges, but researchers who have built one of the most advanced quantum networks to date say they think it is possible\n\nA quantum internet could offer secure communication around the globe sakkmesterke / Alamy\n\nOne of the most complex quantum networks built to date would allow 18 people to communicate securely thanks to the power of quantum physics. The researchers behind the work say it offers a practical path to building a global quantum internet, but others are sceptical.\n\nThe long-promised quantum internet would allow quantum computers to communicate at distance by exchanging particles of light called photons that have been linked together by quantum entanglement. It would also allow networks of quantum sensors to be linked, or classical computers to send and receive unhackable communications. But wiring together a quantum world isn’t as simple as laying down cables, because ensuring that one node of the network can be entangled with another is a challenge.\n\nNow, Xianfeng Chen at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, and his colleagues have shown how to link two quantum networks together. First, they built two networks, each with 10 nodes, which all shared quantum entanglement – effectively two tiny versions of a quantum internet. They then sacrificed one node from each network to fuse the two together into one larger, fully entangled network in which every pair among the 18 remaining nodes could communicate.\n\nNetworking 18 classical computers would be a simple task, requiring only extremely cheap components, but in the quantum world, it involves sharing individual photons between multiple users with timing so precise that it demands cutting-edge technology and expertise. Even communication between a pair of devices is complex, but allowing any pair among 18 users to communicate is unprecedented.\n\n“Our approach offers a crucial capability for quantum communication across different networks and is advantageous for building a large-scale quantum internet that enables communication among all users,” write the researchers, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, in a paper about their work.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Daily The latest on what’s new in science and why it matters each day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThis network fusion, as the researchers describe it, requires a process called entanglement swapping. Photons can be made quantum entangled by carrying out a particular observation called a Bell measurement. Simultaneously measuring the state of one photon from each of two pairs of entangled photons effectively links the most distant two photons in the chain, but uses up the measured photons because any attempt to directly check their state destroys the fragile quantum equilibrium.\n\n“This is not the first time entanglement swapping has been shown,” says Siddarth Joshi at the University of Bristol, UK. “What they have done is they have created a scheme where you can do the swapping between the networks in a bit more of a convenient way.”\n\nJoshi says that quantum communications research is currently split between sending information between two devices over increasingly greater distances, sometimes even with one on a satellite, and trying to create protocols and methods for reliably networking lots of devices at short distances. This research falls into the latter camp. “Both of these are very important,” he says.\n\nBut Robert Young at Lancaster University, UK, says that, while the result is a phenomenal technical achievement that required skill and vast resources, he believes the cost and complexity make it unlikely to act as a prototype for future, wide-scale quantum networks.\n\n“It’s just so far from practical, and it’s so far from anything that could be implemented in the real world,” says Young. “The claim of the paper is that this is the future of how you might fuse quantum networks, but there are just so many challenges to solve in achieving that that it’s frustrating.”\n\nOne problem is the need for so-called quantum repeaters to send information over long distances. Photons increasingly get lost in fibre-optic cables as distance increases, and because quantum information cannot be read and retransmitted – as measurement destroys the photons’ state – signals cannot be boosted along their path. A working quantum repeater would allow signals to be pushed along greater distances, but these devices have proved to be elusive to construct.\n\n“Practically, building a quantum network, we know we’re really going to need some form of quantum repeater,” says Young – something this network demonstration doesn’t address.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long dreamed of a quantum internet, a new kind of network that uses the strange rules of quantum physics to send information securely. Unlike regular internet cables, quantum networks send information using tiny particles of light called photons that can be linked in special ways called entanglement.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University built two small quantum networks, each with 10 nodes (or connection points). They then joined these two networks together into one bigger network with 18 nodes that can all communicate securely using quantum entanglement. This process, called entanglement swapping, links distant parts of the network by carefully measuring photons.\n\n**Impact** – This is one of the most advanced quantum networks ever made and shows a practical way to build larger quantum networks in the future. It allows many users to communicate securely at once, which is much harder than just connecting two devices. While it still faces challenges like sending signals over long distances, it is a clear step forward in developing a quantum internet.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will need to find solutions to send quantum information over longer distances, possibly by creating devices called quantum repeaters. These repeaters would help keep the quantum signals strong across big distances, which is important for a global quantum internet.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Researchers successfully linked two quantum networks into a larger one, showing important progress toward building a secure quantum internet that could connect many users.",
