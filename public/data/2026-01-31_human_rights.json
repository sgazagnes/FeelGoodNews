      "content": "Cyprus holds the presidency of the Council until the end of June 2026. This text will be updated regularly as the hearings take place.\n\nWomen’s Rights and Gender Equality Committee\n\nOn 26 January, Minister of Justice and Public Order Costas Fitiris highlighted gender equality as a core focus of the presidency, with particular emphasis on combating gender-based violence, including online violence. He also referenced strengthening prevention, support to victims and promoting gender mainstreaming across EU policies, plus the upcoming 2026–2030 EU gender equality strategy, as key priorities.\n\nMEPs pushed for a stronger intersectional approach, calling for continued attention to sexual and reproductive health and rights, LGBTQI equality, and gender budgeting. They warned of an ongoing and widespread backlash against women’s rights, highlighted emerging risks linked to digital platforms and artificial intelligence (AI), and called for progress on the long-stalled anti-discrimination directive.\n\nCulture and Education Committee\n\nOn 27 January, Deputy Minister for Culture Vasiliki Kassianidou highlighted the “cultural compass for Europe” as key step towards placing culture at the heart of EU policymaking, and the AgoraEU 2028–2034 programme as an initiative to strengthen culture and media as democratic public goods. The Cyprus Presidency also plans to advance discussions on the EU work programme for culture, enhance media literacy, and address the protection and return of cultural goods.\n\nMany MEPs stressed the need for adequate funding for culture and media in the EU’s next long-term budget. Some highlighted the role of culture and media in countering disinformation, while others called for stronger support for independent cultural creators, better working conditions in the artistic sector, and improved media literacy.\n\nInternal Market and Consumer Protection Committee\n\nOn 27 January, Minister of Energy, Commerce and Industry Michael Damianos said the presidency will prioritise the 2030 consumer agenda, the protection of minors online, and action to tackle deceptive consumer practices. Other priorities outlined by Nicodemos Damianou, Deputy Minister of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy included progressing quickly on all digital omnibus files and concluding negotiations on the customs reform and posting of workers rules.\n\nMEPs questioned the presidency on its plans to strengthen EU digital sovereignty and leadership, notably on digital infrastructure and cybersecurity, amid growing foreign algorithmic interference. They called for stronger enforcement of the Digital Services Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act and asked about a potential social media ban for minors. MEPs sought further clarity on the presidency’s support for a European preference in public procurement and on the stalled late payments file.\n\nTransport and Tourism Committee\n\nOn 27 January, Alexis Vafeades, Minister of Transport, stressed that the presidency will focus on air passenger rights, greener, safer, more efficient and competitive transport, and advancing dual use infrastructure. Marina Hadjimanolis, Deputy Minister of Shipping, highlighted the upcoming EU industrial maritime strategy and a declaration on seafarers. Kostas Koumis, Deputy Minister of Tourism, said that his country will drive the evaluation of a 2030 EU tourism agenda to implement and debate the EU strategy on sustainable tourism.\n\nMEPs emphasised that Parliament stands united behind air passengers and will not allow the watering down of their existing rights. Some MEPs committed to deliver on Parliament’s position on roadworthiness, and asked the presidency to advance the work on the automotive package. Securing adequate financial support for EU cross-border infrastructure, resilience and alternative fuels were amongst other points mentioned by MEPs.\n\nCivil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee\n\nOn 27 January, Minister of Justice and Public Order Constantinos Fitiris highlighted the fight against serious and organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, child sexual abuse and digital threats, as well as the need to reinforce cooperation through Europol and strengthen external borders. Deputy Minister of Migration and International Protection Nicholas A. Ioannides identified migration as a priority, with a focus on implementing the Migration and Asylum Pact and strengthening returns through deeper partnerships with non-EU countries.\n\nMany MEPs called for stronger interoperability to support law enforcement and asylum systems. Several MEPs stressed the need to protect those fighting organised crime, strengthen action on deradicalisation and safeguard data protection. Others raised questions on border control, returns and solidarity, and the need to address hate crime.\n\nDeputy Minister for European Affairs Marilena Raouna stressed that the rule of law is a cornerstone of the European project and essential for the functioning of the single market. She highlighted the presidency’s focus on advancing the Article 7 procedure and taking forward simplification and better regulation.\n\nMany MEPs raised questions on how to respond to new threats such as organised crime, foreign interference and disinformation. Some MEPs stressed the need to ensure judicial independence and a consistent application of rule of law principles, while others highlighted the importance of adequate funding in the next EU long-term budget.\n\nFisheries Committee\n\nOn 27 January, Maria Panayiotou, Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment, said the presidency will work on strengthening the common fisheries policy (CFP). They will also try to ensure that the needs of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors are reflected in the EU’s new long-term budget. The presidency also expects to finalise negotiations on the implementation into EU law of the rules on regional fisheries management organisations and to make progress on the sustainable fisheries partnerships with Mauritania and Morocco.\n\nMEPs unanimously considered \"unacceptable\" the reduction envisaged in the next long-term budget for fisheries. They called for the simplification of fisheries laws, modernisation of the EU’s fishing fleet, and for a pragmatic approach to decarbonisation. MEPs also asked questions about guaranteeing equal opportunities between EU and third-country fisheries and on the use of flags of convenience.\n\nInternational Trade Committee\n\nOn 27 January, Michael Damianos, Minister for Energy, Commerce and Industry said that a rules-based, open but frank relationship with other countries should be at the heart of EU trade relations. At the same time, the EU must defend its values and its legislative independence.\n\nMEPs questioned the minister on the Presidency’s strategy on transatlantic relations, Mercosur, a proposal to counteract steel overcapacity, and the ratification of free trade agreements (notably India and the Philippines). Other questions focused on the reform and strengthening of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), preserving the resilience of the EU’s supply chains, and intensifying the EU response to Russian aggression against Ukraine.\n\nLegal Affairs Committee\n\nOn 28 January, Minister of Justice and Public Order Constantinos Fytiris stressed the need to make advances on legislation relating to the protection of adults, with negotiations expected to start in March. He also committed to bridging differences between EU countries on parenthood rules. Other priorities are the 28th regime - a new set of company rules applicable across the EU, EU rules on patents, and a copyright framework adapted to new technologies.\n\nMEPs inquired about possible investment in the judicial system in the EU’s next long-term budget, European cross-border associations - on which member states raised serious concerns, the temporary application of the Mercosur deal, and Russia’s accountability for its war on Ukraine.\n\nForeign Affairs Committee\n\nOn 28 January, Minister for Foreign Affairs Constantinos Kombos focused on European autonomy and enhanced partnerships around the world as the best way to protect the EU’s security. Supporting Ukraine remains a priority, including throughout sanctions, he said, adding that transatlantic relations should be preserved via constructive dialogue and by working with confidence on contentious issues. Deputy Minister for European Affairs Marilena Raouna stressed the importance of EU enlargement as a strategic investment in the EU’s future.\n\nMEPs asked about advancing the enlargement process and the associated need to reform the EU. They inquired about Türkiye’s role in the EU's security and defence, and if the Greenland crisis could be resolved during the Cypriot Presidency. MEPs also focused on the EU’s engagement in Gaza, measures against the regime in Iran, and the Middle East more generally.\n\nSecurity and Defence Committee\n\nOn 28 January, Defence Minister Vasilis Palmas said the Presidency will focus on continuing to support Ukraine, strengthening Europe’s defence industry, speeding up defence readiness and innovation, investing in maritime security and supporting humanitarian operations, including the evacuation of non-combatant personnel. He also highlighted issues linked to economic security, including addressing threats to critical infrastructure and defence supply-chain vulnerabilities.\n\nMEPs asked about a range of topics, including maritime security, European flagship defence projects, and how to address the use of drones in modern warfare. The possible operationalisation of the EU’s mutual defence clause, EU support loan for Ukraine, the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, and EU countries’ increasing defence spending, were also raised.\n\nConstitutional Affairs Committee\n\nOn 28 January, Deputy Minister for European Affairs Marilena Raouna said that internal EU reforms linked to enlargement, the next long-term budget and competitiveness are key priorities. She also highlighted the pending reform of the European Electoral Act, including the targeted amendment on proxy voting, discussions on Parliament’s right of inquiry, and the Transparency Directive.\n\nMany MEPs called for progress on treaty reform, particularly to address the continued reliance on unanimity in foreign policy decision-making against a backdrop of geopolitical challenges and EU enlargement. Some pressed for a quick agreement on Parliament’s recent initiative on proxy voting and broader electoral reform, while others urged progress on the right of inquiry and the interinstitutional ethics body.\n\nIndustry, Research and Energy Committee\n\nOn 28 January, Vasilis Palmas, Minister of Defence, emphasised as priorities simplifying defence procurement, strengthening the defence industrial base, and supporting innovative SMEs. He also highlighted the importance of EU-NATO cooperation and territorial sovereignty, particularly in the context of Cyprus's illegal occupation.\n\nMichael Damianos, Minister for Energy, Commerce and Industry referenced securing energy supply through interconnections, decarbonisation without deindustrialisation, reducing critical dependencies, and simplifying rules to accelerate industrial and energy projects. The Presidency will also focus, he said, on the new legislative proposal on electricity grids.\n\nNicodemos Damianou, Minister for Research, Innovation and Digital Policy, said that the Presidency will work on the Digital Networks Act (DNA) for the modernisation of telecom infrastructure (5G/6G), online child protection through age verification, and boosting research to drive innovation and retain talents. The Presidency will also try to finalise the work on the EU Space Act.\n\nMEPs questioned the ministers on balancing accelerated energy permitting with environmental protection, the impact of the green transition on households and SMEs, and the ban on Russian oil imports while ensuring energy security. They discussed regulatory simplification for SMEs, reducing reliance on non-European suppliers, and integrating SMEs into strategic supply chains. MEPs also mentioned cybersecurity, EU ownership of cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, talent retention, and effective online child protection through age verification.\n\nDevelopment Committee\n\nOn 28 January Constantinos Kombos, Minister for Foreign Affairs identified water security, resilient health systems, youth opportunities, and women’s empowerment as priorities. The Presidency also aims to deliver a partial general approach among EU governments on the future Global Europe instrument by June 2026. Additionally, he referenced the Global Gateway initiative, humanitarian aid as focus issues, alongside highlighting Eastern Africa, the Middle East - including the reconstruction of Gaza - and Ukraine as geographical areas of particular relevance.\n\nMEPs questioned Minister Kombos on the importance decent job creation for young people, the relationship with the USA at a time when they are reducing aid support, the situation in Syria, asylum and migration, and progress on member state negotiations on Global Europe.\n\nAgriculture and Rural Development Committee\n\nOn 28 January, Maria Panayiotou, Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment, identified the following as priorities: innovation, sustainable farming, and simplification, as well as a set of robust crisis-proof measures. She added that the Presidency is committed to a constructive discussion on the next long-term budget as well as the new Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). Adequate funding for the CAP and a stable, resilient, and affordable food supply chain are also priorities, she said.\n\nMEPs expressed concerns about the new CAP and asked for more clarity on the proposal. Several MEPs want to make sure that imports from outside the EU meet the same strict criteria EU farmers have to respect. Other MEPs called for measures to make farming more attractive for young people and for broad solutions to deal with the different crises affecting the sector.\n\nEmployment and Social Affairs Committee\n\nOn 29 January, Minster for Labour and Social Insurance Marinos Moushouttas said fair and inclusive employment and fair mobility were Preisdency priorities. Clea Hadjistephanou-Papaellina, Deputy Minister for Social Welfare, stressed their commitment to fighting poverty, focusing on child poverty, reinforcing long-term care and active aging, and the rights of persons with disabilities. Access to sustainable and affordable housing should be a fundamental right for all, Interior Minister Constantinos Ioannou, while stressing the need to boost investment and supply and sharing information across EU countries.\n\nMEPs quizzed the ministers about the coordination of social security systems, the traineeships directive, and the revision of the carcinogens, mutagens and reprotoxic substances directive. They welcomed the Presidency’s commitment to fighting child poverty and stressed the need for a dedicated budget for the child guarantee in the next long-term budget. Housing, occupational health and safety, Europe’s care agenda and fair mobility were also discussed.\n\nEnvironment, Climate and Food Safety Committee\n\nOn 29 January, the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment, Maria Panayiotou, highlighted the importance of water resilience as a security, economic stability, and public health concern. She stressed the need to continue legislative simplification without lowering the EU’s environmental ambition, and to boost the transition to a circular economy to reduce dependency on raw materials. Other priorities referenced included the revision of the C02 standards for cars and vans.\n\nMany MEPs called for a more effective water management approach to address water scarcity across the EU. On simplification, a number of political groups agreed that the EU must maintain its level of protection, pointing to realistic environmental legislation as a way forward. Others raised concerns about the proposed cuts to EU agriculture policy in the next long-term budget, questioning how the Presidency will guarantee the green transition, food security and a long-term funding for nature, while building a competitive and resilient Europe.",

      "content": "Adam Levy 00:00\n\nHello, I’m Adam Levy, and this is Off Limits: Academia’s Taboos, a podcast from Nature Careers.\n\nIn this episode: religion.\n\nResearch and religion are often pitted against each other, discussed as if they’re inherently incompatible.\n\nBut, as we’ll learn later in the episode, religious faith is a fundamental part of many academics’ identities,\n\nAnd denying this complexity can negatively impact not just the researchers themselves, but also wider society.\n\nAnd the challenges can be especially severe when a researcher is from a religion.\n\nThis is the case for Maisha Islam. Maisha is a research culture lead for equality, diversity and inclusion at the University of Southampton in the UK, and she’s also a British-Bangladeshi Muslim woman.\n\nIn her work, she’s investigated the experience of others who, like her, have been made to feel like outsiders as they navigate academia.\n\nSo I talked to Maisha to find out the impacts this has had on her. She told me that even having a career in academia was at one point unthinkable to her.\n\nMaisha Islam 01:21\n\nSo I’ve been able to do things that I didn’t even think that were possible, things I didn’t ever dream about doing, mostly because I didn’t know that was a dream I could have.\n\nAdam Levy 01:30\n\nWhy was that, then?\n\nWhy is it that a career in academia wasn’t something that you could imagine for yourself?\n\nMaisha Islam 01:37\n\nI didn’t really have a connection to education when I was, you know, at school. So, you know, in the UK, we go through primary school, secondary school, GCSEs, A-levels, and it wasn’t until I did my A-level in sociology that, you know, when, like a, you know, you turn on a light and things just start clicking and making sense in your head. All of those things, all of my life experiences, started to make sense.\n\nYou know, I was constantly in classrooms where I was being told that British-Bangladeshi school children were one of the lowest achievers within education.\n\nAnd also very mindful, especially in a post- 911 kind of context that, you know, Muslims are portrayed as, you know, problematic groups of people within society.\n\nYou’re all those kind of tropes about, you know, being terrorists, and the women are oppressed, and this, this and this.\n\nAnd I didn’t realize that all of those things were because of structural inequality, not that there was something, you know, inherently wrong with people like me.\n\nAnd so I think I just was really disassociated.\n\nBut also I didn’t feel that connection from, you know, teachers or lecturers who really saw something in me.\n\nSo if you would have told 15-year-old Maisha when she was doing her GCSEs that she’d now be a doctor, I just didn’t, wouldn’t think that that was possible, because no one really saw anything in me, and no one really extended that arm out.\n\nPeople that look like me and come from other minoritized groups, we are typically not offered those opportunities in the same way.\n\nAdam Levy 03:06\n\nNow, once you actually began your studies, began your journey in the academic domain, have there been ways you’ve been made to feel like it’s a sphere that’s not set up for well, for people like you?\n\nMaisha Islam 03:20\n\nOne of the challenges I think I’ve really kind of struggled with is the under-representation of, you know, people and women that look like me within higher education.\n\nAnd therefore that comes with issues of visibility, but also the invisible labour that comes with, I think statistically speaking.\n\nMinoritized people are more likely to take on board what we would call like equality, diversity and inclusion work, and a lot of that is uncompensated labour, and it’s not labor that is remunerated by progression or promotion. But I don’t typically meet, you know, Muslim women.\n\nI’m visibly Muslim, so I wear a hijab. I don’t typically meet them, you know, within academia.\n\nSo again, it’s not finding that kind of support or the empathy from, you know, local networks that could really empathize with my lived experience.\n\nAnd I’ve actually had to seek out, you know, informal mentors to help me when I’ve had some professionally tricky situations.\n\nAdam Levy 04:15\n\nYou’re talking there about representation, especially.\n\nI’m wondering as well whether you’ve ever had specific experiences which have alienated you from academia as a Muslim woman?\n\nMaisha Islam 04:27\n\nOh, gosh, Adam, how long do we have? I mean, yeah, so when I was starting out in my career, a lot of the things that I was advocating for were for Muslim students.\n\nSo as a student, I didn’t have a proper access to prayer spaces.\n\nAs Muslims, we pray five times a day.\n\nAnd so that gets really tricky if we don’t feel like we can have a space to pray on campus, you know, where we spend a majority of our time.\n\nLack of Halal food. So when I talk about halal food, halal just means kind of permissible within, you know, Arabic.\n\nBeing in alcohol-centric spaces, for example, were really tough.\n\nAnd I actually came up with this kind of theory of satisfied settling to denote how Muslim students do not feel empowered to often voice these concerns.\n\nAnd so they compromise their idea of what a good student experience is, because, you know, they’re not getting their kind of religious accommodations in.\n\nAdam Levy 05:23\n\nAre these kinds of issues, things that you felt comfortable and able to bring to the table to make your colleagues and your institution more aware of what you’re going through?\n\nMaisha Islam 05:33\n\nYes, I wouldn’t say bringing the topics to the table is difficult. That is genuinely what I do through my research on my work.\n\nWhat’s the problem is that we’re not invited to the table to even discuss these issues. Or when we do discuss these issues, and we raise it through formal committee meetings and channels, and all the bureaucracy that UK universities go through, we’re not often involved or consulted meaningfully in those processes.\n\nAnd it feels really isolating, and it’s very risky, constantly raising these systemic issues, because it’s very obvious where the like, quote, unquote, dissent is coming from.\n\nWe almost put a target on our backs for having advocated for them in the first place. We are constantly pushing at closed doors sometimes.\n\nAdam Levy 06:19\n\nHave you ever experienced moments, say, in interactions with colleagues, which have made you feel unwelcome in academia?\n\nMaisha Islam 06:28\n\nA lot of the times these are microaggressive, covert, you know, actions that happen that you can’t necessarily put your finger on, like ”That was racism, that was Islamophobic.”\n\nBut you feel it. You feel it in your bones of what the action or the intention kind of was.\n\nIt really comes through with this feeling of, for me, I feel like I need to be perfect all the time, because I’m very conscious of how precarious my position as a visibly Muslim British-Bangladeshi woman is.\n\nAnd we hear this from Muslim academics in the literature as well. You know, we’re never assumed to be the lecturer. You know, within academic context, we’ve had multiple women say how they are always misidentified as students and rather than like a lecturer or academic teaching staff.\n\nAdam Levy 07:16\n\nNow, as you’ve continued in your career in academia, have you been able to build up something of a support network of other people who’ve had similar experiences?\n\nMaisha Islam 07:27\n\nYep, definitely. As I’m kind of progressing on with my career, I’m finding more and more women as I become more connected within UK higher wducation.\n\nBut I completed my PhD last year. And the subject of my doctoral research was looking at British Bangladeshi women within higher education, British Bangladeshi women who were specifically PhD students within higher education.\n\nWhilst I got to the end of my data collection, I realized I now have access to 10 women who don’t know one another and who don’t know other women like us.\n\nWhy don’t we all get together and, you know, form our own, you know, organic network?\n\nIt’s, it’s lovely having those women who just really intimately understand our lived experience. That we don’t need to, you know, constantly go through the time or the effort to retell our experiences of isolation.\n\nOr why when something happens, that it is either sexist or Islamophobic or racist, is just an untold level of understanding that that we have as women together\n\nAdam Levy 08:33\n\nAnd in your doctoral research, did you find that your personal experiences were shared by the other women in academia who you spoke with?\n\nMaisha Islam 08:41\n\nYes, that was very much reiterated through my doctoral research.\n\nSo those feelings of under-representation, invisibility and invisible kind of labor, intersectionality and how that impacts your academic identity formation.\n\nAnd lastly, just inherent Islamophobia and discrimination within our spaces.\n\nThere’s the UK universities that we speak and work in.\n\nAnd when we talk about these kinds of inequalities, they do happen on, kind of two main grounds.\n\nSo the first is academically, so when we talk about research and knowledge production, but also institutionally, you know, the policies and the practices that suppress us from voicing and changing the kind of system within.\n\nSo yes, a lot of these themes did come up in my doctoral research, and I think we are witnessing a lot of what I’m saying in live time now in UK universities.\n\nAdam Levy 09:32\n\nWhat would you like to see actually change within academia to better support not just religious minorities but people in general, who have been underrepresented or face boundaries within academia?\n\nMaisha Islam 09:46\n\nI think where we’re finding ourselves at a bind is we have the Office for Students, who are the regulator of English higher education, saying things like, ”We need to protect freedom of speech,” which I fundamentally agree with.\n\nBut they’re not necessarily being clear on how that extends to hate speech, for example.\n\nI also think our policies and procedures need to be better in recognizing that there is an under representation of people that look like me within spaces, within our academic spaces, within our professional staff spaces. Aand get the data. Really see where it’s going wrong.\n\nAnd how can we, again, go along those lines to start redressing some of those inequalities.\n\nAnd, importantly, bring, you know, people that look like me, racially minoritized, Muslim women, Muslim academics, to the table. Think about how much more we could be doing to encourage that kind of level of representation.\n\nI ultimately believe that, you know, the point of racism, Islamophobia, discrimination, any kind of ism, you know, transphobia, all of these things, they are just patterns of exclusions that we see from academics that have come before me and who will come after me.\n\nBut I think there are steps that we could take, like some of the things I’ve just mentioned, that would ensure we could at least start making more meaningful progress.\n\nAdam Levy 11:09\n\nThat was my Maisha Islam.\n\nAs Maisha mentioned, events centering around alcohol can be especially difficult for Muslims navigating academia.\n\nBut of course, this doesn’t just impact Muslims.\n\nAnd in the next episode, we’ll look at the stigma around alcohol dependency among researchers.\n\nBut now I wanted to find out just how accurate or otherwise assumptions around religion and research actually are.\n\nAnd Elaine Howard Ecklund has researched exactly that.\n\nShe is a sociologist at Rice University in Houston, Texas, where she also directs the Boniuk Institute for the Study and Advancement of Religious Tolerance.\n\nElaine published a book in 2019 titled Secularity and Science: What Scientists Around The World Really Think About Religion.\n\nAnd so I wanted to tease apart exactly why we talk about science and religion as if they’re polar opposites.\n\nElaine Howard Ecklund 12:07\n\nSo we do talk about them is as if they’re polar opposites.\n\nAnd I think that’s why it’s really important to bring the social sciences in here and where we can actually study people.\n\nOur team at Rice University has studied scientists in eight different national contexts.\n\nAnd in the US, about 50% of scientists at universities identify as being part of a religious tradition.\n\nIn the UK, it goes down significantly to less than 20%\n\nAdam Levy 12:41\n\nNow to some, these numbers might actually seem quite high.\n\nEspecially if people do think of science and religion as somehow mutually exclusive.\n\nIs there some reason there’s this discrepancy, maybe, between expectation and reality?\n\nElaine Howard Ecklund 12:56\n\nSo I’ve been really fortunate to also study what the religious public thinks about science, particularly in the US.\n\nAnd there is the sense that while people actually think very highly of science, and all of the things especially that medical science can do for us in caring for our bodies.\n\nThey think that scientists sometimes are not trustworthy, that scientists tend to be irreligious, that all scientists are atheists.\n\nSo you’re exactly right. There is a widespread public perception that scientists are not for religious people.\n\nAnd I think that that’s in part because of the popular writing that’s been done.\n\nSo in the early 2000s there was a lot of writing arguing that, you know, scientists should not be religious, that they usually weren’t religious, that religion and science are completely opposed to one another.\n\nAnd when writing is popular and widespread, then there’s also the sense that there’s a very large group of people who have those attitudes, and that may not be the case.\n\nAdam Levy 14:09\n\nWhat about, then, the impact on those religious scientists themselves? Is there a sense in which this perception affects how they behave and how they disclose and talk about their faith?\n\nElaine Howard Ecklund 14:22\n\nReligious scientists do feel like they have to hide their faith often.\n\nThat’s another reason, I think, that the idea in the scientific community, that there aren’t very many religious scientists are perpetuated.\n\nScientists may be religious, but they just feel like they can’t talk about it because very negative public things are often said within the scientific community itself.\n\nSo, then, a culture of separation really creeps into the scientific community, especially in university science itself.\n\nPeople who want to go into academic science may feel like they can’t. They may feel like it’s quite irreligious, or even anti-religious.\n\nAnd when scientists are personally religious and hold their religions to be very important to themselves, then they sometimes feel like science is not the right place for them, even if they start a degree in science.\n\nAdam Levy 15:15\n\nNow we’re speaking, kind of about religion across the board here. Does this particularly affect people, say, of minority religions in countries?\n\nElaine Howard Ecklund 15:24\n\nWe found that in the United Kingdom broadly, but in England in particular, where there are the most research universities in the UK, that Muslim scientists had a particularly difficult time, that they did not feel like they could go into science, that they felt, sometimes not very welcome.\n\nAnd I think some of their ideas about how Muslim scientists, that is, some of Muslim scientists’ ideas about how they will be treated in science, are kind of accurate.\n\nWe did find stereotyping among the science community, especially at research universities and top research universities. Concerns about Islam, concerns that the tenants of Islamic faith would not allow scientists who are Muslim to check their experiments or repeat experiments.\n\nWe did not find that these concerns were valid when we interviewed and surveyed Muslim scientists themselves. But there still is that culture of fear in the scientific community when it comes to Muslim scientists.\n\nIn the US, on the other hand, there are those same sorts of attitudes towards evangelical Christian scientists, and so that’s those kind of attitudes, even if they’re not actually based in truth.\n\nSo chances are that if you have a Muslim or an evangelical christian scientist who has gone all the way through the PhD that they have figured out how to hold these things, their scientific work and their faith intention or ways in which to make them compatible, that these issues that the broader scientific community is fearful of, are probably not founded.\n\nAdam Levy 17:09\n\nI’m curious what actually brought you personally to this area of research. Is this a topic that’s particularly close to your heart, or is it something you kind of stumbled towards in your career?\n\nElaine Howard Ecklund 17:20\n\nSo both are true. So I have always loved science. I was that kid that entered all of the science fairs. I was raised in a farming community in a rural part of the United States, and so I loved the natural world and the outdoors.\n\nWhen you’re that near to it, you do start to really appreciate and value the beauty of nature. And I also was raised in a fairly conservative religious community that did not affirm higher education and did not affirm science.\n\nAnd so I was so fortunate that I went to a university. I did my work at Cornell University in New York state.\n\nThere was very much a sense among groups of religious people on campus that these things could be very compatible.\n\nFrom the academic side, I’ve always been interested in how competing ideas are actually lived out in real, everyday people’s lives as a kind of sociological question.\n\nSociologists study group behaviour. Scientists seem to have stereotypes about religious people, and religious people have stereotypes about scientists.\n\nAnd I started thinking, ”Gosh, empirical data might be the answer here. Let’s look at the data and see what’s really going on in these communities, because their negative interaction with one another has a lot of consequences.”\n\nAnd we saw in the US that it had, sadly, very deadly consequences when it came to resistance to vaccination during the pandemic.\n\nAnd so I thought, wow, this is a chance to make a real difference in the world by bringing some empirical data to what has been in the past a very heated debate\n\nAdam Levy 18:58\n\nWith everything you understand about how religion is viewed within science and how religious scientists feel about navigating their academic domain, what’s your hope for how we could shift academia in the future?\n\nElaine Howard Ecklund 19:13\n\nI would love for academic scientists to recognize that religious scientists can be good scientists, to break down some of their own stereotypes, and to see religion as just one of those identities that sits along other sides, other identities, like one’s social class and background.\n\nAnd we need those kind of community connections sometimes to do good scientific work and to remain in a profession that can be very difficult.\n\nAnd so if a scientific community doesn’t recognize that, then sadly, it’s potentially pushing away talent, because people’s religious identities are often related to other kinds of identities, gender and race and ethnicity and national context.\n\nAnd we want people to bring their whole selves to their work and to their scientific work, which I think that will make them do better work.\n\nAdam Levy 20:08\n\nElaine Howard Ecklund there, our last interviewee of today’s episode.\n\nBut as I mentioned in our next episode, we’ll be looking at an issue that affects many in academia, but that few feel able to talk about. Alcohol dependency,\n\nSpeaker 4 20:24\n\nThe stigma is a massive barrier to help-seeking. Who would want to admit that they were out of control?\n\nAdam Levy 20:33\n\nUntil then, this has been Off Limits: Academia’s Taboos, a podcast from Nature Careers.\n\nThanks for listening.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many people who work in universities have religious beliefs, but these beliefs are often seen as being in conflict with science and research. This can make it hard for religious academics to talk openly about their faith at work.\n\n**What happened** – Maisha Islam, a British-Bangladeshi Muslim woman and research culture lead at the University of Southampton, shared her experiences of feeling like an outsider in academia. She faced challenges like lack of prayer spaces, limited halal food options, and being one of the few visibly Muslim women in her field. She also described how Muslim students and academics often settle for less because their religious needs are overlooked. Sociologist Elaine Howard Ecklund from Rice University studied scientists’ views on religion and found that many scientists are religious but often hide their faith due to fear of judgment. Muslim scientists in the UK, in particular, reported feeling unwelcome and facing stereotypes.\n\n**Impact** – This story shows that religious faith is a real and important part of many academics’ lives, yet universities often fail to support them properly. The lack of representation and understanding can make religious researchers feel invisible and isolated. It also reveals that common ideas about religion and science being completely opposite are not true. The research highlights the need for universities to recognize and include religious identities to make academic spaces fairer and more welcoming.\n\n**What’s next step** – Experts and academics like Maisha and Elaine suggest universities must collect better data on diversity, create policies that support religious needs, and invite religious minorities to take part in decision-making. This could help reduce discrimination and improve inclusion. Future efforts also include raising awareness about the real experiences of religious academics and challenging stereotypes within the scientific community.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Religious beliefs are an important part of many academics’ identities, and recognizing this can help make universities more inclusive and supportive for everyone.\n",

Elle a aussi expliqué que les étudiants et universitaires musulmans acceptent souvent moins car leurs besoins religieux sont ignorés. La sociologue Elaine Howard Ecklund de l’Université Rice a étudié les opinions des scientifiques sur la religion et a découvert que beaucoup sont religieux mais cachent leur foi par peur d’être jugés.

Le manque de représentation et de compréhension peut rendre les chercheurs religieux invisibles et isolés. Elle révèle aussi que l’idée que religion et science s’opposent complètement est fausse.
