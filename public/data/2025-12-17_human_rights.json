      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nNearly 900 acres of ancestral territory have been officially returned to the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, marking a major milestone in Indigenous land restoration efforts in California. The property, which borders Yosemite National Park and the Sierra National Forest, includes Henness Ridge, a culturally vital landscape that once formed part of an ancestral trail into Yosemite Valley.\n\nFor the Miwuk people, this transfer represents far more than acreage; it is a reconnection to land they stewarded for generations before being forcibly removed in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n“Having this significant piece of our ancestral Yosemite land back will bring our community together to celebrate tradition and provide a healing place for our children and grandchildren,” said Sandra Chapman, Tribal Council Chair and elder of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation. “It will be a sanctuary for our people.”\n\nA strategic collaboration between state and tribal stewards\n\nThe land was transferred from Pacific Forest Trust, a conservation organization that has a track record of working in partnership with Indigenous nations. The project was made possible through funding from the California Natural Resources Agency’s Tribal Nature-Based Solutions Program, which supports Indigenous-led conservation and climate resilience.\n\nThis return builds on precedent: in the 1990s, the Pacific Forest Trust helped create the first-ever conservation easement with tribal entities in the U.S., partnering with the InterTribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council. The Miwuk land return reflects a continuation of that effort to align environmental conservation with Indigenous land rights.\n\nThe significance of Henness Ridge\n\nThe reclaimed land is more than symbolic. Henness Ridge is ecologically rich and culturally foundational. Historically, it served as a corridor for deer and other migratory species and formed part of a traditional trail from the Central Valley to Yosemite Valley.\n\nLocated just west of Chinquapin/Badger Pass and State Highway 41, the property offers sweeping views of both branches of the Wild and Scenic Merced River, the Central Valley, and Yosemite Valley. It is an ideal location for cultural gatherings, environmental education, and traditional ecological practices that were once banned or forgotten under federal oversight.\n\nTribal Secretary Tara Fouch-Moore emphasized the practical and cultural importance of this return: “We will be able to harvest and cultivate our traditional foods, fibers, and medicines and steward the land using traditional ecological knowledge, strengthening our relationships with plants and wildlife, and benefiting everyone by restoring a more resilient and abundant landscape.”\n\nReviving stewardship and sovereignty\n\nThe Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation plans to use the land to support food sovereignty, ceremonial practice, and land-based education. The community will take an active role in protecting local ecosystems, particularly the tributaries that feed the South Fork of the Merced River, a water source protected under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n\nThe land’s return also has symbolic weight. The last of the Miwuk people living in Yosemite Valley were evicted by the National Park Service in 1969. Now, more than five decades later, the community reclaims the ability to once again live, gather, and care for the land on its own terms.\n\nA model for future land returns\n\nThis transfer adds momentum to the growing movement of Indigenous land back initiatives across the United States. It also highlights how collaborative conservation models can combine ecological protection with long-overdue justice for Native communities.\n\nAs public interest in land returns continues to grow, examples like this one demonstrate the benefits of centering tribal leadership in environmental stewardship and how doing so contributes to climate resilience, cultural preservation, and biodiversity.\n\nFor the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, the restoration of Henness Ridge is just the beginning. It offers a space where community healing, ecological restoration, and Indigenous knowledge can take root once again.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation is a Native American tribe whose ancestors lived near Yosemite National Park. Over many years, they were forced off their land during the 19th and 20th centuries. This land holds great cultural and ecological importance for the tribe.\n\n**What happened** – Recently, nearly 900 acres of land next to Yosemite and the Sierra National Forest were officially returned to the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation. This land, called Henness Ridge, was transferred from a conservation group with support from California’s Tribal Nature-Based Solutions Program. The tribe can now use the land for cultural ceremonies, education, and traditional environmental care.\n\n**Impact** – This land return is important because it reconnects the Miwuk people with a place they once cared for and lived on. It allows them to restore traditional food gathering, medicine harvesting, and protect important wildlife habitats. The land also offers a place for community healing after decades of separation and loss.\n\n**What's next step** – The Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation will begin managing the land with their traditional knowledge. They plan to focus on restoring ecosystems, protecting rivers, and using the area for cultural learning and ceremonies. This project may inspire more land returns to Indigenous groups across the U.S., showing how conservation and Native rights can work together.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Nearly 900 acres of ancestral land near Yosemite have been returned to the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, marking a key step in cultural restoration and environmental stewardship.\n",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 16 December 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04050-zNurturing research talent at community-rooted universities and colleges is a necessity, not a luxury.",
      "content": "In September, the US government announced a one-off US$495-million funding boost for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). This is welcome news — but doesn’t redress their chronic underfunding.\n\nThe financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States\n\nIn the United States, HBCUs educate 1.5% of all university students — yet receive only 0.9% of federal research and development (R&D) funding. Data reported in 2024 show combined HBCU endowment assets around $100,000 per student. By contrast, the ten wealthiest US universities received $2 million to $7 million per student in 2023.\n\nAs a scientist and administrator at Meharry Medical College — a 150-year-old private historically Black health-sciences institution in Nashville, Tennessee, with some 1,500 students — I’ve seen how hard it can be to manage on scant budgets. I urge the government to redress funding levels. In the meantime, HBCUs and TCUs can target their investments, as Meharry has done with some success.\n\nOver the past decade, Meharry has increased its funds for research, and its scholarly output, by using metrics to guide budgeting and investments. We tracked publications and citations, grants, awards, student engagement, graduation and career placement rates, facility use, data generation and sharing (how many samples were processed, what data sets were produced and how were shared), research collaborations and investigator diversity. We also expanded our number of sponsors and monitored how funds were used.\n\nBetween the periods of 2010–15 and 2020–25, the number of cross-disciplinary collaborations increased, both between groups at Meharry and with external investigators. The number of papers with Meharry authors indexed in the PubMed database of biomedical literature rose from 444 to 1,067.\n\nEnd racism in science\n\nThree measures underpin this growth. First, we established transdisciplinary pilot grants of $50,000–$75,000 per faculty member lasting for 12–18 months — funded by federal research endowments or private foundations — to seed ideas and support core staff and infrastructure. While maintaining budgets for ongoing cancer, HIV and oral-health studies, we prioritized new projects in genomics, inflammation, immunity and cardiometabolic health. We also launched two new schools: one in applied computational sciences, in 2021; and one in global health, in 2023.\n\nSecond, we invested in infrastructure to handle, store and analyse data securely. We established procedures — including some around human consent and data sovereignty — that meet both federal and Tribal Nations’ standards. Studies that involve human participants must be co-designed with community members to ensure that any concerns — for example, about privacy, potential stigma or data misuse — are addressed early on. Steps such as pre-consented sharing of electronic health records or clinical notes can help to accelerate the analysis of disease risk, treatment response and gaps in care, to inform services and policies that benefit local people. This transparent and respectful approach deepens public confidence in science, especially among populations long marginalized in research.",

      "content": "At the award ceremony for the 2025 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought on Tuesday 16 December in Strasbourg, President Roberta Metsola said: \"I am proud to award this year’s Sakharov Prize to journalists Andrzej Poczobut and Mzia Amaglobeli in recognition of their brave fight for freedom of expression and the democratic future of Belarus and Georgia. This House stands in solidarity with Mzia and Andrzej and calls for their immediate release from prison — because speaking truth to power must never be a crime.\"\n\n\n\nAndrzej Poczobut, journalist imprisoned in Belarus\n\n\n\nAndrzej Poczobut, journalist, essayist, blogger and member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was represented by his daughter, Jana Poczobut, who said to the MEPs: \"It is a great honour to stand here today and accept this award on behalf of my father. (...) For almost five years now, my family has lived with silence, uncertainty, and the absence of someone we love. And today I want to express my deepest gratitude to the European Parliament for remembering him — and for remembering all families who live with the same unanswered questions.\"\n\n\n\nReferring to the case of Mikalai Statkevich, a prominent member of the Belarusian opposition who disappeared in September 2025, she added: \"When we speak (their) names out loud, they stop being statistics. They become real again. And that is why your attention, the attention of the European Parliament, matters so much. It preserves human dignity where everything else tries to erase it.\"\n\n\n\nMEPs have adopted several resolutions condemning the repression in Belarus, demanding the release of political prisoners (estimated at over 1,200), denouncing President Lukashenka’s complicity with Russia in the war in Ukraine, and calling for tougher sanctions and support for Belarusian democratic forces, independent media and human rights defenders. Parliament is a strong supporter of the democratic opposition in Belarus and awarded it the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2020. MEPs adopted a resolution on the case of Andrzej Poczobut in March 2023.\n\n\n\nMzia Amaglobeli, journalist imprisoned in Georgia\n\n\n\nMzia Amaglobeli, Georgian journalist, co-founder and director of independent media outlets Batumelebi and Netgazeti, was represented by her fellow journalist Irma Dimitradze who also works for Batumelebi.\n\n\n\nShe read a speech from Mzia Amaglobeli to the Members: \"I accept (this award) on behalf of my colleagues, the journalists who are now fighting in Georgia to save journalism as such. They work tirelessly to make sure that you hear the voice of resistance of Georgia’s citizens, that the truth is not silenced.\"\n\n\n\nReferring to the authorities in her home country, Mzia Amaglobeli wrote \"This regime is ruthless (...). It destroys free journalism, abolishes opposition political parties and imprisons their leaders, effectively dismantles non-governmental organisations, labels those who work in them as “foreign agents (...). Yet it has failed to silence the protests. Perhaps this is why the European Union’s statements in support of the Georgian people have been stronger and more precise than ever. And for this, I am deeply grateful.\"\n\n\n\nAfter referring the Georgian people’s aspirations to EU membership, she concluded her speech underlining: \"The fate of our struggle does not depend on us alone, because our struggle is not only about us. (...) Fight with us and for us. Fight as you would fight for the freedom of your own countries. Use every mechanism at your disposal and do so before it is too late.\"\n\n\n\nRegarding Georgia, a candidate for EU membership since 2023, MEPs have strongly condemned the significant democratic backsliding in the country and denounced repressive laws (such as the law on ‘foreign agents’), attacks on freedom of expression and the press, and the repression of peaceful protests.\n\n\n\nMEPs have also called for a rerun of the October 2024 elections, in which the ruling Georgian Dream party declared victory. They have denounced Russian influence in the country and demanded the release of detainees. MEPs nevertheless advocate for a membership perspective to be maintained, conditional on reforms and respect for the rule of law and ask for personal sanctions to be imposed on those responsible for the violence.\n\n\n\nA resolution was adopted in June 2025 on press freedom in Georgia and the personal case of Mzia Amaglobeli.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nNamed after Soviet physicist and political dissident Andrei Sakharov, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought is the EU’s highest distinction in the field of human rights. Since 1988, it has been awarded by Parliament to individuals, groups or organisations every year, in recognition of their work defending human rights, freedom of expression and democratic values. It includes €50,000 in prize money.\n\n\n\nSeveral journalists, media and press freedom organisations have received the Prize, including the non-governmental organisation Reporters Without Borders in 2005, the Belarusian Association of Journalists in 2004, the Algerian journalist and writer Salima Ghezali in 1997 and the popular newspaper Oslobodenje, which promoted a multi-ethnic vision of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1993. Parliament also demonstrates its unwavering support for investigative journalism and the importance of press freedom by presenting annually the Daphne Caruana Galizia Prize for Journalism, in honour of the Maltese journalist assassinated in 2017.\n\n\n\nTo find the list of all previous laureates and other information, please consult Parliament's Sakharov Prize website.

Please note that AI translations may take some time to process.\n\nBrussels (dpa) – The European Union has started airlifting humanitarian aid to the Sudanese region of Darfur, the European Commission announced on Monday.\n\n“A total of eight flights will bring life-saving supplies into Darfur, as mass atrocities, starvation, and displacement linked to the conflict in Sudan have left millions in need of humanitarian assistance,” the Commission said in a press release.\n\nA first flight delivered around 100 tons of aid on Friday and further flights are planned throughout December and January, it said. The goods delivered include shelter materials, water, sanitation and hygiene items as well as health supplies.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Darfur “deteriorated sharply” after the city of El Fasher was captured by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in October, the Commission said.\n\n“The loss of the city marked a major escalation of an already catastrophic humanitarian situation, and further restricted aid access. Civilians who managed to flee are reporting widespread violations of international humanitarian law.”\n\nThe air bridge will cost 3.5 million Euro and will be funded from the EU’s humanitarian budget, the Commission said. The EU has so far made available 270 million Euro for humanitarian aid for Sudan this year.\n\nThe RSF in Sudan launched attacks on military and civilian targets in April 2023 after resisting integration into the army. The brutal power struggle that emerged has created what the UN describes as the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. (15 December)\n\nThe editorial responsibility for the publication lies with dpa.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Darfur, a region in Sudan, is facing a severe humanitarian crisis caused by ongoing conflict. Fighting between armed groups has led to many people being forced to leave their homes, shortages of food, and limited access to basic needs like shelter and medicine.\n\n**What happened** – The European Union (EU) began sending important supplies to Darfur by air. Starting in December, eight flights will carry items such as shelter materials, water, hygiene products, and health supplies. The first flight delivered around 100 tons of aid. This effort is called an \"air bridge\" because it creates a direct route to bring help quickly to people in need.\n\n**Impact** – This air bridge is important because it helps millions of people affected by violence and hunger in Darfur. The conflict worsened after a paramilitary group took control of a key city, making it harder for aid to reach those in need. The EU’s action ensures life-saving help can reach people despite these challenges.\n\n**What's next step** – The EU plans to continue these flights through January, using 3.5 million Euros from its humanitarian budget. This is part of a larger 270 million Euro aid package for Sudan this year. The ongoing deliveries aim to keep supporting vulnerable communities as the crisis continues.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU’s new air bridge is delivering essential aid directly to Darfur, helping millions survive during Sudan’s worst humanitarian crisis.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Le Darfour, une région du Soudan, fait face à une grave crise humanitaire due à un conflit armé. Les combats ont forcé de nombreuses personnes à fuir, provoqué des pénuries alimentaires et limité l’accès aux besoins essentiels comme l’abri et les médicaments.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – L’Union européenne (UE) a commencé à envoyer des fournitures importantes par avion au Darfour. À partir de décembre, huit vols transporteront des matériaux pour abris, de l’eau, des produits d’hygiène et des fournitures médicales. Le premier vol a livré environ 100 tonnes d’aide. Cette opération est appelée « pont aérien » car elle crée une voie directe pour acheminer rapidement l’aide.\n\n**Impact** – Ce pont aérien est crucial car il aide des millions de personnes touchées par la violence et la faim au Darfour. Le conflit s’est aggravé après qu’un groupe paramilitaire a pris le contrôle d’une ville clé, rendant l’accès à l’aide plus difficile. L’action de l’UE garantit que l’aide vitale parvienne malgré ces obstacles.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L’UE prévoit de poursuivre ces vols jusqu’en janvier, avec un budget humanitaire de 3,5 millions d’euros. Cela fait partie d’un plan d’aide plus large de 270 millions d’euros pour le Soudan cette année. Ces livraisons continueront de soutenir les communautés vulnérables.\n\n**En une phrase** – Le nouveau pont aérien de l’UE apporte une aide essentielle directement au Darfour, aidant des millions de personnes à survivre lors de la pire crise humanitaire au Soudan.",
