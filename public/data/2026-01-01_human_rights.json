      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nPolitics may often feel gridlocked, but this year we witnessed powerful examples of what’s possible when courage meets action. In our Best of 2025 Politics roundup, we’re featuring policies and leaders that pushed for equity, justice, and real-world solutions that ripple far beyond the headlines.\n\nIreland is preparing to make a fresh cultural experiment permanent. Starting in 2026, the country will officially launch a permanent basic income program for artists, following a three-year trial that showed strong economic and social returns.\n\nUnder the new program, 2,000 selected artists will receive a weekly payment of about $375, or approximately $1,500 per month. Applications are scheduled to open in September 2026, although eligibility requirements have yet to be finalized. According to Irish broadcaster RTÉ, the government may expand the program if additional funding becomes available.\n\nA bold move becomes policy\n\nFirst launched in 2022, Ireland’s Basic Income for the Arts (BIA) pilot program was developed in response to the pandemic’s devastating impact on cultural workers. With live performances canceled and venues shuttered, many artists lost a critical source of income. The program sought to provide stability and recognition to those who shape the nation’s cultural landscape.\n\nParticipants in the pilot included visual artists, musicians, dancers, filmmakers, architects, circus performers, and others. Applicants had to show they were professional cultural workers through documents such as tax records, membership in a recognized arts body, or published reviews.\n\nAs reported by the New York Times, out of more than 9,000 applicants, 8,200 were deemed eligible, and 2,000 were randomly selected to receive the payments. Another 1,000 served in a control group that did not receive funds but were monitored for comparison.\n\nMeasurable returns on investment\n\nThe decision to make the program permanent follows a new report by Alma Economics, which evaluated the pilot’s impact. The results were compelling: the program cost €72 million but generated nearly €80 million in benefits to Ireland’s economy. Artists reported an average increase of over €500 in monthly arts-related income, while income from non-arts jobs decreased by roughly €280, suggesting the program enabled them to focus more fully on creative work.\n\nParticipants also relied less on other social services, receiving about €100 less per month in additional support. “The economic return on this investment in Ireland’s artists and creative arts workers is having an immediate positive impact on the sector and the economy overall,” said Patrick O’Donovan, Ireland’s minister for culture, communications, and sport.\n\nThe report further estimated that if scaled up permanently, the program could lead to a 22 percent increase in artistic output and reduce the average cost of art to consumers by 9 to 25 percent.\n\nPublic support and future expansion\n\nPublic response has been overwhelmingly positive. According to a 2023 government survey, 97 percent of the 17,000 respondents supported the program. However, there was some debate over how participants should be selected: 47 percent preferred prioritizing economic need, 37.5 percent favored artistic merit, and only 14 percent supported random selection.\n\nApplications for the next round of the program will open in late 2026. While details are still under discussion, the Irish government has signaled openness to expanding the program to include more artists in the future.\n\nA model for universal basic income?\n\nIreland’s program has gained international attention as a real-world example of universal basic income (UBI) in action. UBI is a policy model that provides citizens with regular, unconditional payments regardless of employment status. While many proposals remain theoretical, Ireland’s artist-focused approach has been cited as evidence that basic income can work.\n\n“As the pilot shows, basic income works and people need a UBI now to face and deal with the many social, economic, and ecological crises of our world,” said the UBI Lab Network in a statement.\n\nReinhard Huss, an organizer with UBI Lab Leeds, echoed this view. “We need no further pilots,” he told Business Insider. “People need a UBI now.”\n\nAs Ireland sets its sights on making the arts more sustainable, the permanent rollout of basic income for artists could also serve as a blueprint for broader income support programs worldwide.\n\nDid this solution from 2025 stand out to you?

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nPolitics may often feel gridlocked, but this year we witnessed powerful examples of what’s possible when courage meets action. In our Best of 2025 Politics roundup, we’re featuring policies and leaders that pushed for equity, justice, and real-world solutions that ripple far beyond the headlines.\n\nNorway officially closed the chapter on fur farming, marking a significant victory for animal welfare advocates. Once home to nearly 300 fur farms, the country has now phased out the industry entirely, with the last farmers shutting down operations ahead of the given deadline of February 2025. This move places Norway among a growing list of nations that have decided fur farming belongs in the past, not in modern society.\n\nFor decades, fur farming was a staple of Norway’s agricultural landscape. Minks and foxes were bred in small wire cages, destined for luxury fashion markets. However, shifting public attitudes, mounting ethical concerns, and political pressure have led to the industry’s decline. The final decision to ban fur farming was made in 2018, with a phase-out period designed to help farmers transition to other livelihoods. Now, as the deadline nears, the country is making good on its promise to shut the industry down for good.\n\nThe fight for change: how Norway arrived at a ban\n\nThe push to end fur farming in Norway was not an overnight decision. It was the result of years of activism, investigations, and changing public sentiment. Animal welfare organizations, including the Norwegian Society for the Protection of Animals, played a critical role in exposing the inhumane conditions on fur farms. Undercover footage showed animals in distress, suffering from untreated wounds, and exhibiting signs of severe psychological stress due to extreme confinement.\n\nAs these images circulated, the public response was overwhelming. By 2018, opinion polls indicated that the majority of Norwegians supported ending fur farming. A petition calling for a ban garnered 35,000 signatures, adding further momentum to the cause. The government, responding to both public and political pressure, announced its decision to phase out the industry entirely.\n\n“This decision reflects the values of our society today,” said a spokesperson for the Norwegian government. “We have seen the strength of feeling on this issue and have listened.”\n\nEthical concerns: why fur farming had to go\n\nAt the heart of Norway’s decision lies a fundamental ethical debate: should fashion justify suffering? While fur has long been associated with luxury, the reality of fur farming tells a different story.\n\nMinks and foxes, naturally wild and active animals, were confined to small cages with little room to move. Deprived of their natural behaviors like swimming for minks and roaming vast territories for foxes, many exhibited stress-related behaviors, such as pacing and self-mutilation. Investigations frequently uncovered animals with open wounds, infections, and missing limbs, highlighting the industry’s failure to provide even the most basic level of care.\n\nScientific studies backed up these concerns. The Norwegian Veterinary Association, along with numerous animal welfare experts, concluded that fur farming was fundamentally incompatible with modern standards of humane treatment. Unlike other forms of livestock farming, there was no practical way to raise fur-bearing animals without causing severe distress.\n\nAs public awareness of these issues grew, consumer attitudes also began to shift. Many major fashion brands including Gucci, Prada, and Burberry have distanced themselves from fur, choosing ethical alternatives instead. The market for fur was shrinking, making Norway’s decision not just a moral choice, but an economically sound one.\n\nTransitioning away from fur: what happens next?\n\nBanning an industry doesn’t happen without consequences, and Norway has taken steps to support affected farmers. Recognizing the economic impact, the government introduced a compensation plan worth approximately $50 million to help fur farmers transition to new forms of income. Some farmers have moved into other types of agriculture, while others have sought opportunities in tourism, renewable energy, or entirely different industries.\n\nHowever, the transition has not been without challenges. Some fur farmers have contested the decision, arguing that the government’s financial assistance does not fully cover their losses. Lawsuits have been filed, and debates continue over whether the compensation plan is adequate. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about what will happen to the land where these farms once operated, some of which are located in environmentally sensitive areas.\n\nDespite these challenges, Norway’s government remains firm in its stance. The focus now is on ensuring a smooth transition while prioritizing animal welfare and ethical business practices.\n\nA global trend: the future of fur farming\n\nNorway’s decision to end fur farming is part of a larger global shift. In recent years, several European nations such as the United Kingdom, Austria, the Netherlands, and Belgium have banned fur farming. Others, like France and Italy, have implemented restrictions or species-specific bans. Meanwhile, growing pressure from activists has led to calls for an EU-wide ban.\n\nThe fashion industry has also played a significant role in this transformation. As demand for fur declines, high-end brands are increasingly opting for sustainable and cruelty-free alternatives. Innovations in synthetic fur and plant-based materials have proven that luxury and ethics can coexist.\n\nEven in countries where fur farming remains legal, the industry is facing mounting challenges. California became the first U.S. state to ban the sale of fur, and other regions are considering similar measures. The European Union has received over 1.5 million signatures on a petition calling for a total ban on fur farming, signaling that change is on the horizon.\n\nLooking ahead: a shift in values\n\nNorway’s fur farming ban is about more than just one industry; it reflects a broader shift in how society values and treats animals. The decision sends a clear message: ethical considerations must take precedence over outdated traditions. As more countries take steps toward banning fur farming, the global conversation around animal rights continues to evolve.\n\nThis moment is also a reminder that change is driven by collective action. The fur industry did not disappear on its own. It was the result of decades of activism, consumer awareness, and political will. Every decision, from the brands we support to the policies we advocate for, has the power to shape the future of ethical fashion and animal welfare.\n\nNorway’s ban is not just an end, it is a new beginning. It sets the stage for a world where compassion leads the way, proving that progress is possible when we choose to prioritize kindness over cruelty.\n\nDid this solution from 2025 stand out to you?

      "summary": "The centuries-old verdict has been scrapped after decades of controversy about its use in Scottish criminal trials.",
      "content": "We fought for 33 years to abolish not proven verdict after our daughter's murder\n\n5 hours ago Share Save David Cowan Scotland home affairs correspondent Share Save\n\nDuffy family Amanda Duffy went missing after a night out in her home town of Hamilton\n\nJoe and Kate Duffy were devastated and baffled when the man accused of their daughter's murder walked free from court. They had felt certain that Francis Auld would be found guilty of killing 19-year-old Amanda in Hamilton in 1992. But a jury found the charges against him not proven - one of two verdicts of acquittal which could be returned in criminal trials in Scotland. Joe and Kate did not initially understand what the jury's verdict meant – and have now spent more than three decades campaigning for the abolition of not proven. From 1 January, this centuries-old verdict has been consigned to the history books and Scottish trials will end with the accused being found either guilty or not guilty. \"There's some solace in the fact that no other family will have to go through this,\" said Kate. \"There's relief and a feeling of vindication - but most importantly, it's for our daughter. It's for Amanda.\"\n\nJoe Duffy's daughter Amanda died in 1992 at the age of 19\n\nAmanda had gone missing after a night out in her hometown of Hamilton in May 1992. Her body was found on waste ground the next day. By any standards, the murder of the 19-year-old drama student had been exceptionally brutal. Her numerous injuries included a bite on her breast which the defence agreed had been inflicted by Auld. When the jury at the High Court in Glasgow announced the not proven verdict, Joe and Kate had no idea what it meant. They listened in astonishment as the judge told Francis Auld he had been acquitted and was free to go. Afterwards, in a side room, lawyers explained that in the eyes of the law, not proven was exactly the same as not guilty. Auld had been cleared and could never be tried again. Kate fainted. She was carried from the building on a stretcher and taken to hospital.\n\nKate and Joe Duffy - pictired here with local MP George Robertson - have campaigned the verdict's abolition for more than three decades\n\nJoe said that throughout the case the police and prosecution had assured the couple that they had a very strong case and expected to get a guilty verdict. \"So when it was not proven, you were like, what exactly does that mean? There's something wrong here.\" \"It was the fear of knowing that the person who was responsible, in my eyes, was still out there and capable of doing it again,\" said Kate. A common interpretation of not proven was that the jury suspected the accused was guilty, but felt the prosecution had failed to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt. Good luck finding that in a law book. As Joe and Kate were to discover, there was no written legal definition of not proven. Over the years, whenever juries asked, all judges could tell them was that it was a verdict of acquittal, just like not guilty. Research has also shown that some people thought - incorrectly - that the accused could be tried again if the verdict was not proven. That has been allowed in exceptional circumstances since 2011 under double jeopardy legislation, but the method of acquittal plays no part in that process.\n\nFrancis Auld was acquitted after the jury returned a not proven verdict\n\nWithin weeks of the verdict in November 1992, Joe and Kate had set up a table in a street in Hamilton, gathering tens of thousands of signatures for a petition calling for not proven to go. Joe explained: \"I've never understood why you can have two verdicts which mean exactly the same thing. \"The only difference in law between not proven and not guilty is spelling. \"That's it. Why do we need them? Either you're guilty or not guilty.\" Hamilton's Labour MP George Robertson believed some juries were using not proven as a \"cop out\" and put forward a private members' bill at Westminster proposing abolition. He failed to win the backing of the then Conservative government and not proven survived. The Duffys regarded the bill's failure as a stumbling block rather than a knockout blow. They set up a charity to help other families bereaved by murder, culpable homicide and suicide.\n\nThe beginning of the end\n\nTen years ago they established a counselling facility in Hamilton called the Manda Centre, the family's nickname for Amanda. It was a case in 2015 that finally signalled the beginning of the end for not proven. A jury used it when they cleared a man accused of raping a student at St Andrews University. The victim, known as Miss M, sued Stephen Coxen for damages in a civil court and won. The sheriff accepted she had been raped by Coxen. It was said to be the first civil damages action for rape following an unsuccessful criminal prosecution in almost a century. The outcome would have struck a chord with the Duffys. In 1995, Joe and Kate had sued Frances Auld over Amanda's death and won damages - which were never paid. A new campaign for abolition, led by Miss M and backed by Rape Crisis Scotland, argued that not proven was used disproportionately in sexual offence cases. They said it offered juries \"an easy out\" and contributed to \"guilty people\" walking free. Their case won support from leading politicians, including Nicola Sturgeon, who was first minister at the time.\n\nIn 2022, the SNP administration at Holyrood proposed a raft of legal reforms, including the removal of not proven. Controversy over the verdict dates back to the mid-19th Century and the arguments for and against have changed very little over the years. Critics said it was confusing for juries and the public, failed to provide closure for alleged victims, and stigmatized the person on trial by appearing not to clear them completely. Supporters of the verdict argued that it was an important safeguard against wrongful convictions. Scotland's top lawyers - the Faculty of Advocates - put it this way: \"The not proven verdict may be a safety valve for jurors who have not reached the threshold for conviction but reject the impossibility of guilt.\" But this time, abolition had cross-party support and not proven's days were numbered. The Scottish government's bill was passed by MSPs September this year, with Miss M and the Duffys watching from the public gallery at the Scottish Parliament.\n\nMiss M led a campaign for abolition of the not proven verdict\n\nIn what was portrayed as a counter-balance, the legislation brought about another crucial change. Scottish juries have 15 members. Until now, a guilty verdict could be returned through a simple majority - eight votes out of 15. From today, a two-thirds majority will be required. At least 10 out of 15 jurors will have to support a conviction. The Scottish government said there was clear evidence that jurors were more likely to convict if they only had a choice of guilty or not guilty, and the change would ensure the system was fair and balanced. Prosecutors at the Crown Office and campaigners at Rape Crisis Scotland fear the change will make it harder to get convictions. The Law Society of Scotland would have preferred the unanimity or near-unanimity required by the jury system in England and Wales.",

This verdict caused confusion and distress, especially for victims' families.\n\n**What happened** – After 33 years of campaigning, Joe and Kate Duffy helped bring an end to the 'not proven' verdict. Their daughter Amanda was murdered in 1992, and the man accused was found 'not proven' guilty, leaving the family without closure. From January 1, Scottish trials will only allow verdicts of guilty or not guilty, removing the confusing third option.\n\n**Impact** – This change means juries must now clearly decide if someone is guilty or not. It helps victims’ families understand the outcome better and prevents the accused from being left in a legal gray area. The campaign also led to a new rule requiring at least 10 out of 15 jurors to agree on a guilty verdict, aiming to make decisions fairer and more certain.\n\n**What's next step** – The new system will be tested in upcoming trials. Some worry it might become harder to convict people, while others believe it will improve trust in the justice system. The Duffy family and supporters will watch closely to see how the changes affect court cases.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scotland has removed the confusing 'not proven' verdict after decades of campaigning, aiming for clearer and fairer criminal trial outcomes.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – En Écosse, les procès criminels pouvaient aboutir à trois verdicts : coupable, non coupable et non prouvé. Le verdict « non prouvé » signifiait que le jury n’était pas sûr de la culpabilité, mais l’accusé était tout de même acquitté. Ce verdict créait de la confusion et de la douleur, surtout pour les familles des victimes.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Après 33 ans de combat, Joe et Kate Duffy ont aidé à faire disparaître le verdict « non prouvé ». Leur fille Amanda a été assassinée en 1992, et l’homme accusé a été déclaré « non prouvé » coupable, laissant la famille sans réponse claire. Dès le 1er janvier, les procès écossais ne pourront plus utiliser ce verdict, qui sera remplacé par coupable ou non coupable.\n\n**Impact** – Ce changement oblige désormais les jurys à décider clairement si quelqu’un est coupable ou non. Cela aide les familles à mieux comprendre les résultats et évite que l’accusé reste dans une zone juridique floue. La campagne a aussi mené à une nouvelle règle : au moins 10 jurés sur 15 doivent être d’accord pour un verdict de culpabilité, pour plus de certitude.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Ce nouveau système sera testé dans les procès à venir. Certains craignent qu’il soit plus difficile de condamner, d’autres pensent qu’il renforcera la confiance dans la justice. La famille Duffy et ses soutiens suivront attentivement les effets de ces changements.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – L’Écosse a supprimé le verdict « non prouvé » après des décennies de lutte, pour des verdicts de procès plus clairs et justes.\n",

Now she has danced on Strictly Come Dancing and graced the cover of Vogue. What is next for the 24-year-old?\n\n\"The phone rang, it was my agent, and she told me I was going to be on Strictly. I just started screaming.\" Ellie is beaming as she talks from her home in Essex about the phone call she had dreamed about for years. But it was not a surprise to her - she manifested it. \"I said to mum that I would make Strictly happen,\" she says. Yvonne raised her daughter to believe that she could achieve anything. She went on to model, working with Vogue, Gucci, and Adidas, before she was noticed by the producers of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nAdama Jalloh/British Vogue Ellie made history as the first person with Down's syndrome to feature on the cover of Vogue\n\nShe has also been nominated for an Emmy for her role on Malory Towers\n\nEllie had also filmed her first acting role, as Nancy in the BBC series Malory Towers, for which she has just been nominated for an Emmy award. \"I wanted to be on Vogue, and that happened.

On the day Ellie was born, her mother Yvonne was told her daughter had Down's syndrome and would never amount to much. \"A nurse asked me if I wanted to leave Ellie at the hospital,\" she says. Ellie had to have open heart surgery when she was five months old. \"It was an 11-hour operation. I remember walking round London in silence, just willing the time away,\" Yvonne says.\n\nEllie Goldstein When Ellie was born 24 years ago, doctors said she would never walk or talk\n\nEllie Goldstein Yvonne has raised Ellie to believe she can achieve anything\n\nMore than two decades on, Yvonne hopes attitudes have changed, and parents would never be treated in the same way today. \"One of the reasons I'm so proud of what Ellie has achieved is that she is helping to change how others see people with learning disabilities,\" Yvonne says.

I want to show that having Down's sydrome doesn't stop you,\" she says.\n\nWhen Ellie dreamed of being on Strictly, she originally hoped to be paired with professional dancer Nikita Kuzmin.

She was sad at first, but says it was her favourite dance and, most importantly, her connection with Vito shows no sign of stopping. The pair have still been dancing together every week, and he leaves her voice notes most nights. \"We're learning all the dances we didn't get to do, and we're going to go bowling and to Nando's soon,\" she says.\n\nEllie Goldstein Ellie and Vito will be dancing in front of audiences again soon\n\nNext up is the Strictly tour, which she \"can't wait\" for. \"I really hope I can finally get a 10 from the judges, especially from Craig because he's my favourite,\" she says.

It was a \"huge shock\" when she found out she had been nominated. \"It was my first ever acting role, and it was a beautiful experience,\" she adds.

I told the BBC producers, so maybe it will happen.\" Whether on the dancefloor, the stage or presenting Strictly, Ellie is just getting started.",
