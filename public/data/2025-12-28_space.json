Researchers found evidence of water ice less than a meter beneath the surface, close enough to be harvested for water, oxygen, and fuel. The location strikes a rare balance between sunlight and cold, helping preserve the ice. It could also offer clues about whether Mars once supported life.",
      "content": "Before humans can make the long trip to another world, scientists must identify a safe and practical place to land. New research led by a University of Mississippi scientist suggests one region on Mars may meet many of the requirements for future human missions.\n\nErica Luzzi, a planetary geologist and postdoctoral researcher with the Mississippi Mineral Resources Institute, led a study that uncovered signs of water ice located just below the Martian surface. The research, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, points to a possible local water supply that astronauts could rely on during extended stays on Mars.\n\n\"If we're going to send humans to Mars, you need H 2 O and not just for drinking, but for propellant and all manner of applications,\" Luzzi said. She carried out the work during her postdoctoral research at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute within NASA Ames Research Center.\n\nShe explained that ice close to the surface is especially valuable because it could be accessed more easily than deeply buried deposits. This approach, known as in situ resource utilization, allows explorers to use materials already available on another planet rather than transporting everything from Earth.\n\nIce Just Beneath the Martian Surface\n\nBy studying high resolution orbital images, the research team examined the Martian landscape and found signs of ice less than 1 meter below the surface in Amazonis Planitia. This area lies in Mars' mid latitudes and is already being considered as a possible destination for future human landings.\n\n\"The mid-latitudes offer the perfect compromise -- they get enough sunlight for power, but they're still cold enough to preserve ice near the surface,\" Luzzi said. \"That makes them ideal for future landing sites.\"\n\nThe team used images from HiRISE, the most detailed camera ever sent to another planet. These images revealed craters that expose ice, patterned ground known as polygonal terrain, and other surface features that often indicate ice just below the surface.\n\nWhy Water Ice Matters for Astronauts\n\nAccessible water ice would allow astronauts to produce drinking water, breathable oxygen, fuel, and other essentials needed to survive and work on Mars for long periods.\n\n\"For the moon, it would take us one week, more or less, to go back and forth to Earth for resupply,\" said Giacomo Nodjoumi, a postdoctoral researcher at the Space Science Data Center of the Italian Space Agency and a co author of the study. \"But for Mars, it would take months. So, we have to be prepared for not having resupply from Earth for extended periods of time.\n\n\"The most important resources are oxygen to breathe and water to drink. That's what makes our candidate landing site really promising.\"\n\nClues to Mars' Past and Present Habitability\n\nThe presence of ice could also help scientists search for signs of life. According to the researchers, ice has the potential to preserve evidence of biological activity.\n\n\"This also has astrobiological implications,\" Luzzi said. \"On Earth, ice can preserve biomarkers of past life, and it can also host microbial populations. So, it could tell us if Mars was ever habitable.\"\n\nNext Steps Toward Confirmation\n\nCollecting direct samples of the ice would require sending a robotic mission to the region.\n\n\"The next step would be radar analyses to better understand the depth and patchiness of the ice,\" Luzzi said. \"The lag deposit, material on top of the ice, might vary, which affects whether the ice is preserved.\n\n\"Understanding that will help us decide where a robotic precursor should land.\"\n\nA rover or future human mission would also be needed to confirm whether the ice is made entirely of water or mixed with other materials.\n\n\"We will never be sure of something if we don't have a rover, a lander or a human to take real measurements,\" Nodjoumi said. \"We have strong evidence to suggest that this is water ice, but until we go there and measure it, we won't be 100% sure.\"\n\nAlthough human exploration of Mars remains years away, this research helps narrow down where astronauts might one day touch down on the Red Planet.",

      "content": "Dark energy just got even weirder and why the Universe may end in a 'Big Crunch'\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Pallab Ghosh Share Save\n\nKPNO/NOIRLab A lonely telescope in the Arizona desert tracks millions of distant galaxies to determine the ultimate fate of the Universe\n\nThere is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space. An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by gravity, ending in what astronomers call a \"Big Crunch\". The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation. Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team's assertions.\n\nNASA/ESA These are thousands of galaxies captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. dark energy is driving them apart at ever increasing speed\n\nWhat is dark energy?\n\nAstronomers previously thought the Universe's expansion, which began with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow due to gravity. Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down, distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other. Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms themselves apart in a \"Big Rip\". Eventually, some astronomers thought the expansion would slow down under the force of gravity and then slowly collapse in on itself, something they called the Big Crunch. Tentative results this year now support this theory.\n\nThe controversy began in March with unexpected results from an instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi). Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with.\n\nThe data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof Ofer Lehav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi project. \"Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of physics,\" he says. Then in November the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) published research from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the weirdness of dark energy is weirder still. Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27 years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were. This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down. \"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Prof Lee tells BBC News starkly. \"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\" If, as Prof Lee's results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back together. \"Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a possibility. \"Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for which we still do not know the answer,\" says Prof Lee. Prof Lee's work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. \"I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of supernovas,\" he says. \"The correlation with age is not very tight, so I think it is dangerous to apply a 'correction'. It looks weak to me.\" The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with almost unchanging dark energy. But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms. \"Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel that already our research is very, very significant.\"\n\nMarilyn Sargent/Berkeley Lab A cathedral for the cosmos: an instrument inside this telescope can track the movement of 5,000 galaxies at a time",

      "summary": "New observations reveal that the relationship between ultraviolet and X-ray light in quasars has changed over billions of years. This unexpected shift suggests the structure around supermassive black holes may evolve with time, challenging a decades-old assumption.",
      "content": "An international group of astronomers has uncovered strong evidence suggesting that the material surrounding supermassive black holes has not remained the same throughout the history of the universe. The findings indicate that the structure and behavior of this matter may have shifted over billions of years.\n\nLed by researchers at the National Observatory of Athens, the study was published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. If confirmed, the results would challenge a foundational idea in astronomy that has guided research for nearly 50 years.\n\nWhat Makes Quasars So Bright\n\nQuasars, first identified in the 1960s, rank among the most luminous objects known. They shine so intensely because they are powered by supermassive black holes pulling in surrounding matter. As this material spirals inward under immense gravity, it forms a rotating, disk-shaped structure before falling into the black hole.\n\nFriction within this disk heats the matter to extreme temperatures. As a result, it can emit 100 to 1,000 times more light than an entire galaxy made up of about 100 billion stars. This overwhelming brightness allows quasars to outshine their host galaxies and makes them visible to telescopes across vast cosmic distances.\n\nFrom Ultraviolet Light to Powerful X-Rays\n\nThe glowing disk around a black hole produces enormous amounts of ultraviolet light. Scientists believe this light plays a key role in generating the even more energetic X-rays emitted by quasars. As ultraviolet rays travel outward, they pass through clouds of highly energized particles located very close to the black hole, a region known as the \"corona.\"\n\nWhen ultraviolet light interacts with these particles, it gains energy and transforms into intense X-ray radiation. These X-rays can then be detected by space-based observatories.\n\nA Long-Standing Cosmic Relationship Under Question\n\nBecause both types of light originate near the same black hole, astronomers have long known that ultraviolet and X-ray emissions from quasars are closely linked. Typically, brighter ultraviolet light goes hand in hand with stronger X-ray output. This relationship, identified almost five decades ago, has offered critical clues about the physical conditions near supermassive black holes.\n\nThe new study challenges the assumption that this connection is universal. That assumption suggests that the structure of matter around black holes is essentially the same everywhere and at all times in the universe.\n\nInstead, the researchers found that when the universe was younger (about half its present age), the relationship between ultraviolet and X-ray light looked noticeably different from what astronomers see in nearby quasars today. This points to changes in how the accretion disk and corona interact over roughly the last 6.5 billions of years.\n\n\"Confirming a non-universal X-ray-to-ultraviolet relation with cosmic time is quite surprising and challenges our understanding of how supermassive black holes grow and radiate,\" said Dr. Antonis Georgakakis, one of the study's authors.\n\n\"We tested the result using different approaches, but it appears to be persistent.\"\n\nHow the Researchers Made the Discovery\n\nTo reach their conclusions, the team combined fresh X-ray observations from the eROSITA X-ray telescope with archival data from the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton X-ray observatory. Together, these datasets allowed scientists to analyze the X-ray and ultraviolet emissions of an exceptionally large sample of quasars.\n\nThe broad and consistent sky coverage provided by eROSITA proved especially important. It enabled the team to examine quasar populations on a scale that was not possible before.\n\nWhy the Findings Matter for Cosmology\n\nThe idea that the ultraviolet and X-ray relationship in quasars is universal underlies some methods that use quasars as (standard candles) to map the shape of the universe and study dark matter and dark energy. The new results suggest scientists need to be cautious, since the assumption of an unchanging black hole environment over cosmic time may not hold.\n\n\"The key advance here is methodological,\" said postdoctoral researcher Maria Chira of the National Observatory of Athens, who led the study.\n\n\"The eROSITA survey is vast but relatively shallow -- many quasars are detected with only a few X-ray photons. By combining these data in a robust Bayesian statistical framework, we could uncover subtle trends that would otherwise remain hidden.\"\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\nUpcoming eROSITA all-sky scans will allow astronomers to observe even fainter and more distant quasars. By combining these future observations with next-generation X-ray and multiwavelength surveys, researchers hope to determine whether the observed changes reflect real physical evolution or are influenced by how the data were collected.\n\nThese efforts promise deeper insight into how supermassive black holes power the brightest objects in the universe and how their behavior has transformed over cosmic time.",
