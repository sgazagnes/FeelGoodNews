      "title": "A smarter way to screen for breast cancer is emerging",
      "summary": "A groundbreaking study shows that breast cancer screening works better when it’s personalized. Instead of annual mammograms for all, women were screened based on genetics, health history, and lifestyle factors. This approach reduced advanced cancers without increasing risk for those screened less often. Most women preferred the personalized model, hinting at a major shift in future screening guidelines.",
      "content": "A large new study suggests that tailoring breast cancer screening to a woman's individual risk may be safer and more effective than relying on routine annual mammograms for everyone. By matching screening frequency to personal risk levels, researchers found it was possible to reduce the likelihood of diagnosing more advanced cancers while still ensuring people receive the level of screening they need.\n\nThe findings are based on data from 46,000 women across the United States who took part in the first phase of the WISDOM study. The results point to a major change in how breast cancer screening could be approached, moving away from age-based rules and toward a system built around comprehensive risk evaluation. UCSF served as the coordinating center for the study.\n\nWhy Age Alone May Not Be Enough\n\n\"These findings should transform clinical guidelines for breast cancer screening and alter clinical practice,\" said Laura J. Esserman, MD, MBA, director of the UCSF Breast Care Center. Esserman is the study's first author. The research was published Dec. 12 in JAMA and presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. \"The personalized approach begins with risk assessment, incorporating genetic, biological, and lifestyle factors, which can then guide effective prevention strategies.\"\n\nBreast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States, excluding skin cancers. For decades, screening guidelines assumed that most women faced similar risk and relied largely on age as the deciding factor, even though research has long shown that breast cancer risk can vary greatly from one person to another.\n\nHow the WISDOM Study Worked\n\nThe WISDOM study directly compared traditional annual mammography with a screening strategy based on individual risk. Using well validated risk models, researchers grouped participants into four categories by considering age, genetic information, lifestyle factors, health history, and breast density.\n\nWomen in the lowest risk group, representing 26% of participants, were advised to delay screening until age 50 or until an algorithm indicated their risk had reached that of a typical 50-year-old. Those at average risk, about 62% of the group, were advised to undergo screening every two years. Annual mammograms were recommended for the 8% classified as having elevated risk. The highest risk group, accounting for 2% of participants, was advised to receive screening twice a year, alternating between mammography and MRI, regardless of age.\n\nPersonalized Prevention for Higher-Risk Women\n\nParticipants identified as having elevated or highest risk also received customized guidance on lowering their chances of developing breast cancer. Support included access to an online decision-making tool focused on breast health and direct contact with a breast health specialist. Recommendations covered lifestyle changes such as improving diet and increasing physical activity, along with discussions about medications that can help reduce risk.\n\nImportantly, the personalized screening approach did not lead to a higher rate of late-stage cancer diagnoses. Women who chose not to be randomized were able to join an observational group and select their preferred screening strategy. Among them, 89% opted for risk-based screening, suggesting strong acceptance of the personalized approach.\n\n\"Shifting resources from lower-risk women to higher-risk women is an efficient, effective approach to screening for and preventing breast cancer,\" said co-author Jeffrey A. Tice, MD, a UCSF professor of Medicine who specializes in developing and evaluating breast cancer risk assessment tools.\n\nExpanding Genetic Testing Beyond Family History\n\nSince launching in 2016, WISDOM has enrolled more than 80,000 women. More recently, researchers have included women as young as 30 in an effort to identify those who may face an increased risk of aggressive early cancers due to inherited genetic variants.\n\nOne of the study's most notable findings was that 30% of women who tested positive for a genetic variant linked to higher breast cancer risk reported no family history of the disease. Under current clinical guidelines, many of these women would not typically qualify for genetic testing.\n\nIn addition to well known pathogenic variants such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, the study also evaluated smaller DNA changes that can be combined into a polygenic risk score. This approach improved the precision of risk predictions and resulted in 12% to 14% of participants being reassigned to a different risk category.\n\n\"This is one of the first studies to offer genetic testing to all women, regardless of family history,\" said co-author Allison S. Fiscalini, MPH, of UCSF, director of the Athena Breast Health Network and the WISDOM study. \"When used as part of a comprehensive risk assessment, these results could have a real impact on improving the safety and effectiveness of screening and prevention.\"\n\nWhat Comes Next for Risk-Based Screening\n\nResearchers are continuing to refine risk assessment through the WISDOM 2.0 study, which is now enrolling participants. The goal is to better identify women who face a higher likelihood of developing aggressive breast cancers and provide them with screening and prevention strategies tailored to their long-term health needs.\n\nCo-Authors: From UCSF, authors include Laura J. van 't Veer, PhD; Maren T.

Researchers have created a world-first database that tracks beneficial bacteria and natural compounds linked to immune strength, stress reduction, and resilience. The findings challenge the long-standing obsession with germs as threats and instead highlight the hidden health benefits of biodiversity. This shift could influence everything from urban design to environmental restoration.",
      "content": "Viruses and bacteria are often viewed as harmful, but researchers at Flinders University are drawing attention to a lesser-known side of the microbial world. Their work highlights the important ways microbes can support human health, challenging the idea that all microorganisms are threats.\n\nFlinders microbial ecologist Dr. Jake Robinson and his colleagues explore this shift in a new paper published in Microbial Biotechnology. The research encourages moving beyond a fear-based view of microbes and biogenic compounds and instead recognizing their potential health benefits.\n\nA New Database of Health-Promoting Microbes\n\nThe study introduces the 'Database of Salutogenic Potential', a first-of-its-kind, open-access prototype that gathers information on microbes and natural compounds linked to positive health outcomes. The goal is to make this growing body of evidence easier to access and apply.\n\n\"Emerging evidence shows that exposure to diverse environmental microbiomes and natural biochemical products also promotes health and resilience,\" says Dr. Robinson.\n\n\"Rather than viewing biodiversity as something to be eliminated, contemporary approaches recognize the vital role of diverse ecosystems in creating salutogenic, or health-promoting, environments.\"\n\nMoving Beyond a Disease-Focused View\n\nBy bringing this information together, the researchers aim to change how microbes are understood. \"By consolidating this data, we aim to rebalance the story of microbes -- highlighting not only what makes us sick, but also what keeps us well. After all, health is not merely the absence of disease.\"\n\n\"The implications are far-reaching -- from designing healthier cities and schoolyards to guiding ecosystem restoration and rethinking green infrastructure.\"\n\nDespite their importance, salutogenic microbes, meaning those that support health, and beneficial biochemical compounds have received far less attention than disease-causing organisms. Yet they play key roles in immune regulation, metabolism, disease suppression, stress reduction, and ecosystem stability.\n\nWhy Beneficial Microbes Have Been Overlooked\n\n\"For well over a century, microbes and chemicals in the air have mainly been studied as threats -- causes of infection, disease and contamination. While this pathogen-centric lens has saved countless lives, it also risks overlooking the invisible biodiversity that actively supports human and planetary health,\" says Dr. Robinson.\n\n\"Just as biodiversity loss threatens our health, restoring microbial and biochemical richness could be a key to healthier futures.\"\n\nKey Findings and Future Applications\n\nThe team identified 124 microbial taxa with potential health-promoting effects, along with 14 biochemical compounds (from soil bacteria to plant-derived phytoncides). These are linked to benefits that include immune system support and reduced stress.\n\n\"We aim to shift the balance between pathogen-centric and salutogenic perspectives, potentially enabling future applications in public health, urban planning and ecosystem restoration,\" says Dr. Robinson.\n\n\"While the current iteration of the database primarily centers on human health outcomes, it is designed to expand into ecosystem health domains, embedding salutogenic thinking into One Health frameworks.\"\n\nBuilding a Foundation for Healthier Environments\n\n\"We're not viewing this database as a finished tool. It's a foundation -- an invitation for scientists, practitioners and communities to co-create a fuller picture of how invisible biodiversity sustains our lives.\"\n\n\"However, even in its early form, this resource rebalances the traditional pathogen focus by consolidating data on salutogenic taxa, their benefits and environmental origins -- and it will advance holistic approaches to environmental and human health.\"\n\nUrban Soils and Microbial Risk\n\nIn related research, Dr. Robinson has worked with scientists in China to show that urban soils contain more pathogens than forest soils. The study found a several-fold increase in the pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae in cities. Published in Communications Earth and Environment (Nature Springer), the findings emphasize the need to better understand how bacterial zoonotic pathogens build up in densely populated urban areas and what that means for both human health and soil biodiversity.\n\nFunding and Additional Information\n\nFunding: This study was supported by the National Environmental Science Program (NESP), National Natural Science Foundation of China, New Zealand Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment, International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences and National Key Research and Development Program of China.\n\nDr. Jake Robinson's third book, The Nature of Pandemics: Why Protecting Biodiversity is Key to Human Survival, has just been published.",

      "summary": "Type 2 diabetes doesn’t just raise the risk of heart disease—it physically reshapes the heart itself. Researchers studying donated human hearts found that diabetes disrupts how heart cells produce energy, weakens the muscle’s structure, and triggers a buildup of stiff, fibrous tissue that makes it harder for the heart to pump. These changes are especially severe in people with ischemic heart disease, the most common cause of heart failure.",
      "content": "Researchers at the University of Sydney have uncovered new evidence showing that type 2 diabetes directly changes the heart's structure and how it produces energy. These findings help explain why people living with diabetes face a much higher risk of developing heart failure.\n\nThe study, published in EMBO Molecular Medicine, was led by Dr. Benjamin Hunter and Associate Professor Sean Lal from the School of Medical Sciences. The team examined donated human heart tissue from patients receiving heart transplants in Sydney, comparing it with tissue from healthy donors. Their analysis revealed that diabetes drives specific molecular changes inside heart cells and alters the physical makeup of heart muscle. These effects were most pronounced in patients with ischemia cardiomyopathy, which is the leading cause of heart failure.\n\n\"We've long seen a correlation between heart disease and type 2 diabetes,\" said Dr. Hunter, \"but this is the first research to jointly look at diabetes and ischemia heart disease and uncover a unique molecular profile in people with both conditions.\n\n\"Our findings show that diabetes alters how the heart produces energy, maintains its structure under stress, and contracts to pump blood. Using advanced microscopy techniques, we were able to see direct changes to the heart muscle as a result of this, in the form of a build-up of fibrous tissue.\"\n\nHeart disease remains the leading cause of death in Australia, and more than 1.2 million Australians are living with type 2 diabetes.\n\nAssociate Professor Lal said: \"Our research links heart disease and diabetes in ways that have never been demonstrated in humans, offering new insights into potential treatment strategies that could one day benefit millions of people in Australia and globally.\"\n\nLooking Inside Diseased Human Hearts\n\nTo better understand how diabetes affects the heart, the researchers studied heart tissue from both transplant recipients and healthy individuals. This direct examination allowed them to see how diabetes influences heart biology in real human patients rather than relying solely on animal models.\n\nThe results showed that diabetes is more than a co-morbidity for heart disease. It actively accelerates heart failure by interfering with essential biological processes and reshaping heart muscle at the microscopic level.\n\n\"The metabolic effect of diabetes in the heart is not fully understood in humans,\" said Dr. Hunter.\n\nHow Diabetes Disrupts the Heart's Energy Supply\n\nIn healthy hearts, energy is mainly generated from fats, with glucose and ketones also contributing. Previous research has shown that glucose use increases during heart failure. However, diabetes interferes with this process by reducing how sensitive heart cells are to insulin.\n\n\"Under healthy conditions, the heart primarily uses fats but also glucose and ketones as fuel for energy. It has previously been described that glucose uptake is increased in heart failure, however, diabetes reduces the insulin sensitivity of glucose transporters -- proteins that move glucose in and out of cells -- in heart muscle cells.\n\n\"We observed that diabetes worsens the molecular characteristics of heart failure in patients with advanced heart disease and increases the stress on mitochondria -- the powerhouse of the cell which produces energy.\"\n\nStructural Damage and Fibrosis in the Heart Muscle\n\nBeyond energy production, the researchers found that diabetes affects the proteins responsible for heart muscle contraction and calcium regulation. In patients with both diabetes and ischemic heart disease, these proteins were produced at lower levels. At the same time, excess fibrous tissue accumulated within the heart, making the muscle stiffer and less able to pump blood efficiently.\n\n\"RNA sequencing confirmed that many of these protein changes were also reflected at the gene transcription level, particularly in pathways related to energy metabolism and tissue structure, which reinforces our other observations,\" said Dr. Hunter.\n\n\"And once we had these clues at the molecular level, we were able to confirm these structural changes using confocal microscopy.\"\n\nImplications for Future Treatment and Care\n\nAssociate Professor Lal said identifying mitochondrial dysfunction and fibrosis-related pathways opens the door to new treatment approaches.\n\n\"Now that we've linked diabetes and heart disease at the molecular level and observed how it changes energy production in the heart while also changing its structure, we can begin to explore new treatment avenues,\" he said.\n\n\"Our findings could also be used to inform diagnosis criteria and disease management strategies across cardiology and endocrinology, improving care for millions of patients.\"",

      "content": "The myth of willpower - and why some people struggle to lose weight more than others\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Nick Triggle Health correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC\n\n\"Fat people just need more self-control.\" \"It's about personal responsibility.\" \"It's simple, just eat less.\" These were some of the 1,946 comments, posted by readers, beneath an article I wrote last year about weight-loss injections. The idea that obesity is simply a matter of willpower is held by a great many people - including some medical professionals. Eight out of 10 people said obesity could be entirely prevented by lifestyle choices alone, according to a study of people in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the US, which was published in medical journal The Lancet. But Bini Suresh, a dietitian, who has spent 20 years working with obese and overweight patients, is exasperated by the idea. This, she believes, is only a fraction of the picture. \"I frequently see patients who are highly motivated, knowledgeable and trying consistently yet still struggling with weight.\" \"Terms like 'willpower' and 'self-control' are the wrong words,\" agrees Dr Kim Boyd, medical director at WeightWatchers. \"For decades people have been told to eat less and move more and they will lose weight... [But] obesity is much more complex.\" She and other experts I spoke to suggest there are myriad reasons a person might be obese, some of which are not yet fully understood: but what is clear is that it is not a level playing field.\n\nGetty Images Expecting weight management and maintenance to rely purely on willpower is both unrealistic and unfair, argues Bini Suresh, who is head of dietetics at the Cleveland Clinic in London\n\nThe government has turned to regulation to try to tackle this. Its most recent move – banning junk food advertising on television before 9pm and completely for on online promotions – comes into effect today. Yet many think this too will only go so far in tackling what is now an overwhelming obesity problem in the UK - one that affects more than one in four adults.\n\nA battle against biology\n\n\"The amount of weight people gain is significantly influenced by their genes and those genes are relevant for everybody,\" explains Prof Sadaf Farooqi, a consultant endocrinologist who treats patients with severe obesity and related endocrine disorders. She says that certain genes affect the brain pathways that regulate hunger and fullness in response to signals sent by the stomach to the brain. \"Variants or changes in these genes are found in people with obesity, which means they feel more hungry and are less likely to feel full after eating.\"\n\nIn Pictures via Getty Images Obesity can lead to heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and some cancers\n\nPerhaps the single most important of these genes – at least the most important of those known about so far – is the MC4R gene. A mutation in this gene, which encourages overeating and means we feel less full, is carried by roughly a fifth of the global population. \"Other genes affect metabolism – how quickly we burn energy,\" adds Prof Farooqi. \"That means some will gain more weight and store fat from eating the same amount of food, than other people do, or they will burn less calories when they exercise.\" She estimates that there are likely to be thousands of genes that have an influence on weight and that we only know in detail about roughly 30 to 40 of them.\n\nThe science behind yo-yo dieting\n\nYet even this is only part of the story. Andrew Jenkinson, a bariatric surgeon and author of Why We Eat Too Much, explains that everyone has a weight their brain understands or thinks is the right weight for them - regardless of whether it's a healthy weight or not. It's known as set weight point theory. \"This [set weight] is determined by genetics, but also by other factors, such as your food environment, stress environment and sleep environment.\" And it means that body weight is like a thermostat: your body aims to maintain that preferred range. If weight drops below this \"set point\", hunger rises and metabolism slows, just as a thermostat turns up the heat when it's too cold, according to that theory. Once your point is set, it's very difficult to alter it by willpower, Dr Jenkinson argues. This can also explain yo-yo dieting. \"For instance, if you're 20 stone and your brain wants you to be 20 stone and you go on a low calorie diet and lose two stone, your body's reaction to that is just the same as if you were starving,\" he says.\n\nGetty Images Some will gain more weight and store fat from eating the same amount of food, than other people do, says Prof Farooqi who leads the Genetics of Obesity Study, based at the University of Cambridge. She estimates that there are likely to be thousands of genes that have an influence on weight\n\n\"It's going to have that reaction of voracious appetite, food-seeking behaviour and a low metabolism,\" he adds. \"These appetite signals are profoundly strong. They're as strong as a thirst signal, they're there to help us survive… \"A voracious appetite is something that's really, really difficult to ignore.\" As to the science behind this, Dr Jenkinson points to the role of leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells. \"It acts as a signal to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that basically controls your weight set point, to tell [it] how much energy storage the body has. \"The hypothalamus will look at the leptin level and if it looks like we're storing too much energy or too much fat, it will automatically alter our behaviour by decreasing our appetite and increasing our metabolism.\" At least that's how leptin should work. Often, it fails, particularly in the Western food environment, he explains.\n\nGetty Images A report last year by The Food Foundation also suggested that healthier foods are more than twice as expensive per calorie than less healthy foods\n\nThis is because the leptin signal shares a signalling pathway with insulin. \"So if insulin levels are too high, it actually then dilutes the leptin signal and suddenly the brain can't sense how much fat is stored.\" The good news is that this set point isn't fixed – it can shift gradually through sustained lifestyle changes, improved sleep, stress reduction and long-term healthy habits. Much like resetting a thermostat – over time, slow, consistent adjustments can help the body accept a new, healthier range.\n\nObesity in UK: The perfect storm\n\nNone of this accounts for the rise in obesity – after all, our genes and the biological makeup of our bodies have not changed. The proportion of adults classified as overweight or obese has steadily risen over the past decade, with the Health Foundation's 2025 analysis indicating that more than 60% of UK adults now fall into this category (including around 28% who are obese). Part of this is down to the sheer volume – and affordability – of poor quality, high-calorie foods, and in particular ultra-processed foods. Add to that aggressive marketing and advertising of fast food and sugary drinks, growing portion sizes, and limited opportunities for physical activity (often due to urban design or time pressures), and it makes for a perfect storm.\n\nGetty Images The government has introduced a ban on advertising certain unhealthy foods on television before 9pm and a complete ban on online promotions - it comes into effect today\n\n\"[As a result] we have become more obese as a population and, of course, those with a greater genetic propensity to put on weight have done so,\" says Prof Farooqi. Public health experts refer to this as the obesogenic environment, a term first used in the 1990s as researchers began linking rising obesity rates to external factors like food availability, marketing, and urban design. Together, many experts argue, these factors create constant cues and pressures toward overeating and inactivity, meaning even highly motivated individuals struggle to maintain a healthy weight. But all of this also explains why willpower has become more of a loaded term too.\n\nThe personal responsibility debate\n\nSitting in her office at Newcastle City Council, public health director Alice Wiseman can see food everywhere. \"There are coffee shops, bakeries and takeaways. You can't go to school or work without passing a food place. \"Visibility matters – if you pass lots of takeaways on your way to work, you're more likely to buy one. Your body's almost reacting to the food around it.\" In Gateshead, where she is also public health director, planning permission has not been granted to a new hot food takeaway since 2015. But across the wider country, the fast-food and takeaway industry has continued to grow – it is worth more than £23bn a year. And UK food advertising spend is dominated by products high in fat, salt and sugar, such as confectionery, sugary drinks, fast food, and snacks, according to the latest Ofcom Communications Market Report.\n\nGetty Images Some argue regulation is important in tackling obesity\n\nBut Ms Wiseman suggests the new measures introduced today to restrict TV and online advertising of junk food – or officially \"less healthy food\" – will only go so far. A report last year by The Food Foundation also suggested that healthier foods are more than twice as expensive per calorie than less healthy foods. \"In families where money is tight it is difficult to afford to eat healthily,\" says Ms Wiseman. \"I'm not saying personal responsibility doesn't have a role to play. But when you think about it, you have to ask what has changed? We haven't suddenly got less willpower.\" Ms Suresh agrees. \"We're living in an environment engineered for over-consumption.\" \"Obesity is not a failure of character. It's a complex, chronic condition shaped by biology and a highly obesogenic environment. Willpower alone is not enough and framing weight loss as solely a matter of discipline does harm.\"\n\nHowever, others have a different take on the word \"willpower\". Prof Keith Frayn, author of A Calorie is a Calorie, agrees many overweight people would probably not have been so, 40 years ago. \"It is the environment that has changed, not their willpower or anything else,\" he says. But he adds: \"I worry that dismissing 'willpower' makes it too easy to resign oneself to being at a weight that may not be what is desired, or best for health.\" He points to large databases of people who have successfully lost weight and have maintained that weight loss, for example the National Weight Control Registry in the USA, with over 10,000 participants. \"Those people describe both losing weight and keeping it off as 'hard', the latter even harder than the former… \"I would suggest that if you were to tell those people that willpower has nothing to do with it, they would be quite affronted.\"\n\n'You can't legislate people into shape'\n\nThe broader debate, of course, is how much responsibility the state should hold. Ms Wiseman believes regulation is an important tool in tackling obesity, arguing that promotions such as buy-one-get-one free deals encourage impulse buying. But Gareth Lyon, head of health and social care at right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange, argues that more legislation is not the way forward. \"You can't legislate people into shape,\" he says. \"Bans and taxes on the foods that people enjoy eating are effective only in making life harder, less enjoyable and more expensive for people at a time when Britain is already struggling with the cost of living.\" Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, a right-leaning think tank, also believes that obesity is an \"individual problem\", not a public health one. '[Obesity] is because of choices made by that individual,\" he argues. \"So ultimately, you can't go much beyond the individual. I find it a fairly bizarre idea that it's the government's responsibility to make people slimmer. \"I'd like to see a serious independent evaluation of these policies and if they don't work they should be repealed.\"\n\nGetty Images The fast-food and takeaway industry has continued to grow across the country - it is worth more than £23bn a year.\n\nAs for willpower, this will always play some sort of a role – what varies is the extent to which experts think it does. Ms Suresh believes it is only one part of a bigger tapestry. And the first step is about educating people about what other factors are at play. \"This perspective shifts the focus from a moral judgement about willpower to a compassionate, science-informed support system which ultimately offers better chances for long-term success.\" There are also ways to strengthen willpower, argues Dr Eleanor Bryant, a psychologist at Bradford University. \"It's not constant all the time. It's affected by your mood, how tired you are and, in terms of eating, how hungry you are…\"\n\nWhat also matters is how you think about it. There are two types of willpower – flexible and rigid. Someone who is rigid sees it as black and white. \"If you succumb to temptation you basically give in. You eat that biscuit and then you carry on eating.\" In psychological terms, this is known as disinhibited eating. \"Whereas, someone who is flexible says, 'OK, I've eaten one biscuit… but I will stop there,'\" says Dr Bryant. \"Needless to say, being flexible is much more successful.\" But she says: \"Exercising willpower with food is probably more difficult than in other areas [of life].\" Ms Suresh agrees, though she says that once people understand the limits of willpower, their ability to exercise it actually strengthens. \"When these patients understand that their struggle is rooted in biology, not lack of discipline, and are supported with structured nutrition, consistent meal patterns, psychological strategies and realistic goals, their relationship with food improves markedly.\" Top picture credit: Getty Images",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many people believe that losing weight is simply about willpower and eating less. This idea is common but doesn’t explain why some people struggle more than others, even when they try hard.\n\n**What happened** – Experts have found that thousands of genes influence how our bodies manage weight. For example, some genes affect hunger signals in the brain, making some people feel hungrier or less full after eating. One gene, called MC4R, is linked to overeating and is found in about one in five people worldwide. Scientists also explain that our bodies have a “set weight point,” like a thermostat, which the brain tries to keep steady. When people lose weight, their bodies may react by increasing hunger and slowing metabolism, making it hard to keep the weight off.\n\n**Impact** – This new understanding shows that weight loss is not just about willpower or personal responsibility. It also depends on biology and the environment, such as the easy availability of unhealthy food and constant advertising. This helps explain why obesity is a complex problem and why many people find it difficult to lose weight despite their best efforts. It challenges the unfair idea that people who struggle with weight are simply lazy or lack self-control.\n\n**What’s next step** – Governments are introducing rules like banning junk food ads on TV before 9pm and online to help reduce exposure to unhealthy food. Experts say that long-term support, including healthy habits, better sleep, and stress management, can slowly help reset the body’s weight set point. Education about the biological and environmental causes of obesity may reduce stigma and lead to more effective, kind support for those trying to manage their weight.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Weight loss is influenced by many genes and the environment, making it more complex than just willpower, and understanding this can lead to better support and policies.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Beaucoup pensent que perdre du poids dépend seulement de la volonté et de manger moins. Cette idée est courante mais n’explique pas pourquoi certaines personnes ont plus de difficultés, même en essayant fort.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des experts ont découvert que des milliers de gènes influencent la gestion du poids par notre corps. Par exemple, certains gènes affectent les signaux de faim dans le cerveau, rendant certaines personnes plus affamées ou moins rassasiées après avoir mangé. Un gène appelé MC4R, lié à la suralimentation, se trouve chez environ une personne sur cinq dans le monde. Les scientifiques expliquent aussi que notre corps a un « poids de consigne », comme un thermostat, que le cerveau essaie de maintenir. Quand on perd du poids, le corps peut réagir en augmentant la faim et en ralentissant le métabolisme, ce qui rend la perte de poids difficile à maintenir.\n\n**Impact** – Cette nouvelle compréhension montre que la perte de poids ne dépend pas seulement de la volonté ou de la responsabilité personnelle. Elle dépend aussi de la biologie et de l’environnement, comme la facilité d’accès à la malbouffe et la publicité constante. Cela explique pourquoi l’obésité est un problème complexe et pourquoi beaucoup de personnes ont du mal à perdre du poids malgré leurs efforts. Cela remet en question l’idée injuste que les personnes en surpoids sont simplement paresseuses ou manquent de contrôle de soi.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les gouvernements mettent en place des règles, comme l’interdiction des publicités pour la malbouffe à la télévision avant 21h et en ligne, pour limiter l’exposition aux aliments malsains. Les experts disent qu’un soutien à long terme, incluant de bonnes habitudes, un meilleur sommeil et la gestion du stress, peut aider progressivement à réinitialiser le poids de consigne du corps. Informer sur les causes biologiques et environnementales de l’obésité peut réduire la stigmatisation et offrir un meilleur soutien à ceux qui essaient de gérer leur poids.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – La perte de poids dépend de nombreux gènes et de l’environnement, ce qui est plus complexe que la seule volonté, et comprendre cela peut améliorer le soutien et les politiques.\n",
