      "content": "Chickenpox vaccines for young children start across UK\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Philippa Roxby and Smitha Mundasad Health reporters Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nAll young children in the UK can now be offered protection against chickenpox for the first time on the NHS. The vaccine will be combined with the existing MMR jab, given at 12 and 18 months of age, which already helps protect against measles, mumps and rubella. Children up to the age of six can catch up on doses when invited. Experts say the new, combined vaccine called MMRV, where V stands for varicella - another name for chickenpox - is expected to reduce the many thousands of families affected by the infection each year and prevent the most severe cases. Until now, parents have had to pay up to £200 to buy a vaccine privately to protect their children.\n\nFrom 1 January, the MMRV vaccine will be introduced into the standard list of children's vaccinations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with Scotland announcing a rollout start date in early January. What is chickenpox and how can I get my child vaccinated? Chickenpox is very common in young children. The main feature is an itchy, spotty rash which blisters then scabs over. It can be painful, and cover the body from head to toe. Children often feel unwell for several days, with a fever and muscle aches. It also spreads easily. Some 90% of children under the age of 10 catch chickenpox at some point, and a week off school or nursery is fairly common. But it can develop into something more severe, warns Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency. \"For some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox can be very serious, leading to hospital admission and tragically, while rare, it can be fatal,\" she said. Complications can include bacterial infection of scabs, and much more rarely, a swelling of the brain known as encephalitis, lung inflammation known as pnemonitis, and stroke. Young babies and adults are more likely to be seriously ill with the infection. Pregnant women are particularly at risk because of potential complications in both the mother and unborn baby.\n\n'My daughter is still living with the pain, 14 years on'\n\nMaria Horton Beth's mum Maria says she would have given her daughter the vaccine if it had been available 14 years ago\n\nMaria Horton's daughter, Beth, was just two-and-a-half years old when she had a stroke in the weeks after getting chickenpox. \"She collapsed and her arm and leg went all floppy and then she started to have a seizure,\" Ms Horton, who lives in Plymouth, said. Beth has had to live with many of the consequences ever since - she can't use her right hand, has speech difficulties and lives in pain, her mother said. \"I know some people are hesitant about vaccines but if I'd known years ago what I know now, I wouldn't hesitate to give her the vaccine. \"As a mum, if you could go back in time and stop something catastrophic happening to them, you absolutely would. \"And if I could prevent somebody else from going through what Beth did, that would be amazing.\"\n\nDr Claire Fuller, NHS England's national medical director, said providing protection against chickenpox was \"a hugely positive moment for children and their families\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting urged all parents to take up the offer of the vaccine, describing the rollout as a \"historic milestone in protecting our children's health\" from a disease that \"sends thousands to hospital every year\". The MMRV vaccine has been safely used for decades in other countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and Germany, which have all seen decreases in the number of people getting chickenpox and fewer serious cases. The part of the vaccine which protects against chickenpox has been shown to be very effective - around 97% after two doses - and long-lasting. The UK has been lagging behind for various reasons. There were concerns over the costs of a UK-wide vaccination programme and a potential rise in cases of shingles - when the chickenpox virus is reactivated in adulthood - but that has not been found to be an issue after many years of vaccination in the US. Recent research also shows the scale of the impact of chickenpox on children and the NHS. An estimated £24 million in income and productivity is lost every year in the UK due to chickenpox in childhood, NHS England says. It also calculates that the vaccine rollout could save £15 million a year in NHS treatment costs. For all those reasons, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, recommended the introduction of the vaccine on the NHS in November 2023. \"Families will save both time and money - no longer facing lost income from taking time off work or having to fork out for private vaccinations,\" Streeting said. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said it was \"welcome news\" that a vaccine was being rolled out across the UK. Meanwhile the Royal College of GPs said all NHS childhood vaccines were safe and effective, adding that jabs were \"some of the most important health interventions parents can make for their children\".\n\nWho can get a chickenpox vaccine, and when?\n\nGetty Images",

      "content": "The great debate about whether the NHS should use magic mushrooms to treat mental health\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Pallab Ghosh Science Correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nListen to Pallab Ghosh read this article Larissa Hope truly believes that psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, saved her life. Back when she was 17 and starting out as an actress, she was cast in the TV drama Skins, but the new-found fame brought out a previously buried trauma. She didn't find antidepressants effective - but that small dose of psilocybin, which she took under clinical supervision, marked a turning point. \"When I experienced it, I burst out crying,\" she says today. \"It was the first time in my life I had ever felt a sense of belonging and safety in my body I kept saying, 'I'm home, I'm home'.\" Now, almost 20 years on, Larissa maintains that it was this, along with therapy, helped her confront suicidal feelings. Not everyone feels the same. Jules Evans, a university researcher, had a very different experience when he first took LSD, albeit for recreational purposes, back when he was 18. The trip sent him into what he describes as a \"deluded\" state.\n\nJules Evans Jules Evans says he felt socially anxious and suffered from panic attacks years after taking LSD: 'I thought, I've permanently lost my mind'\n\n\"I believed that everyone was talking about me, criticising me, judging me. I thought, I've permanently damaged myself; I've permanently lost my mind. \"It was the most terrifying experience of my life.\" Today he is director of the Challenging Psychedelic Experiences Project, which helps people experiencing difficulties after taking psychedelics. He says he felt socially anxious and suffered from panic attacks years after his own experience and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). But these two starkly different experiences are at the heart of a dilemma currently facing doctors, regulators and politicians. That is: should doctors be allowed to prescribe treatments that involve the use of magic mushrooms and other potentially useful psychedelic drugs?\n\nMagic mushrooms and depression\n\nThe question has come to the fore amid a series of new studies that suggest psychedelic drugs could help treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, trauma and addictions such as alcohol and gambling. The use of psychedelic medicine is illegal at present unless in authorised research or clinical trials. But since 2022, more than 20 such trials have tested different psychedelic medicines for conditions such as depression, PTSD, and addiction. The results of many of these studies suggest that the treatments can help, while several others have mixed or unclear results. Only a few so far have clearly found no benefit on their main measures. Results from one of the largest clinical trials into the use of psilocybin, by UK biotech firm Compass Pathways, is due later this year.\n\nA scan comparison shows a hyperactive brain of a psychedelic user next to someone who hasn't taken psychedelics\n\nThe UK's medicines regulator is waiting for this data as it considers whether to relax the current tight restrictions and allow use of the psychedelic medicine outside research and trials. Prof Oliver Howes, chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Psychopharmacology Committee, is optimistic. He says he sees psychedelics as a promising potential new treatment for psychiatric disorders - including for patients in the NHS. \"One of the key messages is that this is something we desperately need - more treatments and better treatments for mental health disorders… \"These treatments are really interesting because they've shown promise in these small-scale studies… and have the potential to work quicker.\" But he is also cautious, emphasising the need to see results from the trials. \"It's really important that we get evidence and not overhype the potential benefits.\" Others have also urged caution. A report by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, published in September 2025, warned of the potential dangers of psychedelics, and doctors also stress that taking psychedelic drugs is not just illegal but can also be harmful.\n\nFaster acting, fewer side effects?\n\nDrug use is as old as civilisation itself. Magic mushrooms, opium and cannabis have long been used for both recreation and rituals. By the 1960s and 1970s, LSD, also known as acid, was used by the counterculture movement, with Harvard psychologist and counterculture guru, Timothy Leary, urging young people to \"turn on, tune in, drop out\". In other words, to turn on and awaken their inner potential, tune in to the state of society around them and to drop out of social norms of the time. But soon, these drugs were associated with social unrest and moral decline.\n\nGetty Images The late American psychologist Timothy Leary urged people in the 1960s to 'turn on, tune in, drop out'\n\nBy the time they were banned in the late 1960s and early 1970s, greater restrictions were being applied to scientific research around them too. But a series of ground-breaking scientific developments in the 2010s by Prof David Nutt and his team at Imperial College London began a process that may well end up changing that. Subsequent clinical trials on depressed patients indicated that psilocybin was at least as effective as conventional anti-depressants, and with fewer side effects. But there was another big advantage, according to Prof Nutt: how fast-acting it is. \"We thought rather than wait for eight weeks for antidepressants to switch off the part of the brain associated with depression, maybe psilocybin could switch it off in the space of a few minutes.\" This view, although scientifically promising, is not universally accepted.\n\nA series of new studies that suggest psychedelic drugs could help treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and PTSD\n\nProf Nutt is a respected scientist, but his assertions have generated controversy. He was dismissed in 2009 as chair of the government's drugs advisory body, the Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs, by the then Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson, following certain public comments - such as claiming there was \"not much difference\" between the harm caused by horse-riding and ecstasy - which were seen as incompatible with his role as a government adviser. In recent years, Prof Nutt's studies sparked many more investigations across the world on the potential therapeutic benefits of other psychedelic drugs.\n\nShould they really be available on the NHS?\n\nAt University College London, neuroscientist Dr Ravi Das has been trying to understand why some habits harden into addictions while others fade away. He believes psychedelics may help find the answer. The study he leads has been recruiting heavy drinkers to test whether dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a short-acting psychedelic also used as a recreational drug, can be used to to target the brain's memory and learning systems. It builds on evidence suggesting psilocybin can disrupt habitual behaviours linked to addiction.\n\n\"Every time someone drinks, a bit like Pavlov's dog, you're learning to associate things in the environment with the rewarding effect of alcohol,\" he says. \"We've been focusing on whether certain drugs, such as psychedelics can break down those associations.\" This is a very early-stage study, but if this and future trials are successful, the aim is to offer it as a treatment within the NHS (with regulatory approval). \"If psychedelic therapies prove to be both safe and more effective than current treatments, I would hope to see them made accessible via the NHS — rather than to just the privileged few who can afford them privately,\" he says. Ketamine, which was the subject of a previous trial by Dr Das, sits in a different legal category and can be used as part of a medical treatment in the UK. Other psychedelics, such as DMT, LSD, psilocybin and MDMA are currently deemed to have no legitimate medical use and so can only be used for research - and even then under very strict and hard-to-obtain medical licenses. Dr Das believes positive results from trials might change views as the emerging scientific evidence mounts. \"I hope if there's sufficient evidence, the government will be open to revising the scheduling of these drugs,\" he says.\n\nDr Ravi Das is testing whether the short-acting psychedelic could target the brain's memory and learning systems in heavy drinkers\n\nHowever, an analysis, published in the British Medical Journal in November 2024 by a PhD student Cédric Lemarchand and colleagues, questioned how easy it was to determine the precise effect of psychedelic drugs. \"Because hallucinogens are often combined with a psychotherapy component, it is difficult to separate the effects of the drug from the therapeutic context, complicating comprehensive evaluations and product labelling.\" It also suggested short-term trials may not detect \"the potential for harm and serious adverse events from long-term use of hallucinogens… The potential for abuse or misuse must also be considered.\"\n\n'People are suffering... It's a moral failing'\n\nWhile research suggests therapeutic benefits from psychedelic medicines, doctors remain cautious. Prof Howes believes that - except for ketamine, which has been assessed by the regulator - psychedelic treatments should not be routine medical practice in the UK outside research settings, until larger, more rigorous trials provide more robust evidence for their safety and effectiveness. \"In a clinical trial setting, it's very carefully evaluated. If people take these on their own or in a backstreet clinic, then there is no guarantee of that and the safety issues start becoming a major issue.\" His warnings are supported by figures from various studies, gathered by Challenging Psychedelic Experiences. It suggests that 52% of respondents who regularly use psychedelic drugs say they have had an intensely challenging psychedelic trip, 39% of whom considered it \"one of the five most difficult experiences of their life\". In addition, 6.7% said they considered harming themselves or others following a challenging experience, and 8.9% reported they were \"impaired\" for more than a day after a difficult trip. Some people required medical or psychiatric assistance and continued to feel worse for weeks, months, or in some cases years after their experience, according to Mr Evans. \"Ideally, I would love doctors and regulators to know more about these adverse effects, and how people can recover from them, before they say, any of these therapies are safe,\" he argues.\n\nCompass Pathways A Compass Pathways session showing a patient receiving guided psychedelic therapy\n\nBut Prof Nutt, Prof Howes and Dr Das, believe that progress into the clinic is being slowed by the difficulty of obtaining permission to carry out medically supervised clinical trials. \"There are so many people suffering unnecessarily,\" Prof Nutt told BBC News. \"And some of them are dying, because of the unreasonable barriers to research and treatment that we face in this country. It is, in my view, a moral failing. \"When these medicines are proven to be safe and effective, I think it is vital they are made available through the NHS to all who need them, not limited to the private sector, as happened with medical cannabis.\" Although he urges caution, it is a view shared by Prof Howes. \"There are big barriers to doing this research, so we do ask for the government to review the regulations of these substances, for research, because it does lead to long delays, and, we desperately do need new treatments.\" The analysis from Mr Lemarchand calls for greater scrutiny of trials. \"To guarantee that hallucinogens are rigorously vetted before endorsing them as safe and effective treatments medical journals must appraise the evidence more critically, fully account for limitations, avoid spin and unsubstantiated claims, and correct the record when needed.\" The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is also blunt in stating that Schedule 1 \"contains those of no medicinal value,\" so they should sit under the tightest controls, it says. Ministers also tie the Home Office licensing regime directly to public protection.\n\n'If psychedelic therapies prove to be both safe and more effective than current treatments, I would hope to see them made accessible via the NHS,' says Dr Das\n\nThe government has backed plans to ease licensing requirements for some clinical trials approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and Health Research Authority, with work under way to implement exemptions for certain universities and NHS sites. A cross-government working group is co-ordinating the cautious rollout, pending the results of pilot projects. But some doctors, including Prof Howes, say changes are moving painfully slowly. \"There's still a lot of red tape holding things up,\" he says. Supporters of psychedelic medicines hope that so-called phase three trials by Compass Pathways, will lead to further relaxations, at least on research. Larissa Hope's concern is for people in the position she once was in. \"It is a reflection of society that psychedelic medicine is not more accessible as a treatment for everyone. \"It could stop so many premature deaths, as it did for me.\" Top Image Credit: Getty Images",

One idea suggests that when people move more, the body shifts energy away from other tasks to pay for that activity. The other model proposes that energy use can expand, allowing total daily expenditure to rise as activity increases. The researchers set out to learn which of these ideas best reflects what actually happens across different activity levels.\n\nTo answer that question, the team measured total energy expenditure, meaning the total number of calories burned in a day, among people with widely varying levels of physical activity.\n\n\"Our study found that more physical activity is associated with higher calorie burn, regardless of body composition, and that this increase is not balanced out by the body reducing energy spent elsewhere,\" said Kevin Davy, professor in the Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise and the principal investigator of the study.\n\nMeasuring Calories Burned in Real Life\n\nParticipants drank special forms of oxygen and hydrogen and provided urine samples over a two-week period. Oxygen leaves the body as both water and carbon dioxide, while hydrogen exits only as water. By comparing how much of each isotope was lost, researchers could estimate how much carbon dioxide participants produced and, in turn, how much energy they used. Physical activity was tracked using a small waist-worn sensor that recorded movement in multiple directions.\n\nThe study included 75 participants between the ages of 19 and 63. Activity levels ranged from largely inactive lifestyles to ultra-endurance running.\n\nNo Evidence the Body Cancels Out Exercise\n\nThe results showed that as people moved more, their total energy use increased accordingly. The body did not appear to compensate by dialing down energy use elsewhere. Essential functions such as breathing, blood circulation, and temperature regulation continued to require the same amount of energy, even as physical activity rose.\n\nThis means the body does not clearly offset or \"cancel out\" the extra calories burned through movement.\n\n\"Energy balance was a key piece of the study,\" said Kristen Howard, senior research associate at Virginia Tech and the article's lead author. \"We looked at folks who were adequately fueled. It could be that apparent compensation under extreme conditions may reflect under-fueling.\"\n\nLess Sitting, More Moving\n\nThe researchers also observed a strong connection between higher activity levels and reduced time spent sitting. Simply put, people who move more tend to spend less time being inactive overall.\n\nTaken together, the findings suggest that the long-debated idea that increased movement leads to increased calorie burn may be more accurate than some experts have assumed. While the results support the additive energy model, the researchers note that more work is needed. \"We need more research to understand in who and under what conditions energy compensation might occur,\" said Davy.",

      "content": "Getting ready for a new baby can feel overwhelming. Excitement and worry often go hand in hand, along with the strong desire to protect someone you haven’t met yet.\n\nSadly, keeping babies safe from toxic chemicals is more challenging than ever. A 2025 study in Pediatric Research calls chemical pollution “one of today’s most significant threats to the developmental potential of children worldwide.” The study found that persistent organic chemicals can cause pregnancy complications and limit fetal growth. It also showed that exposure to flame retardants and organophosphate pesticides is strongly linked to negative effects on children’s brain development.\n\nA 2025 UC Davis study found that exposure to harmful chemicals is “widespread” among U.S. preschoolers. Using data from the National Institute of Health’s ECHO Cohort, which follows over 60,000 children, researchers found phthalates, parabens, bisphenols, pesticides, flame retardants, and other chemicals in children’s urine. Younger kids had higher levels than older ones, and children from racial and ethnic minority groups faced greater exposure to several types of chemicals.\n\nThe lessons of the first several generations of humans living with plastic suggest that new parents take a different approach to raising baby, one that minimizes chemical exposure, especially to plastics that became a staple in baby products beginning in the 1960s.\n\nWhy Infants Are Especially Vulnerable\n\nBabies have special risks from chemical exposure that adults do not. Chemicals can disrupt their development in the first few years and raise the risk of health problems later on.\n\nImmature blood-brain barrier: The first year of life offers toxins easier access to developing neural systems. According to Harvard’s Center on the Developing Child, the protective barrier that restricts chemicals from entering brain tissue “is absent in the fetus and only reaches maturity in the first year after birth.”\n\nThe first year of life offers toxins easier access to developing neural systems. According to Harvard’s Center on the Developing Child, the protective barrier that restricts chemicals from entering brain tissue “is absent in the fetus and only reaches maturity in the first year after birth.” Higher relative exposure: Infants breathe faster than adults and take in more air, water, and food relative to their body weight. The EPA notes that children “drink more water, eat more food, and breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults,” which increases their exposure to contaminants.\n\nInfants breathe faster than adults and take in more air, water, and food relative to their body weight. The EPA notes that children “drink more water, eat more food, and breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults,” which increases their exposure to contaminants. Limited detoxification capacity: Research published in 2025 confirms that “in the first two months of life, the metabolism and renal clearance of toxicants is lower compared to adulthood, leading to higher bioaccumulation of toxicants.”\n\nResearch published in 2025 confirms that “in the first two months of life, the metabolism and renal clearance of toxicants is lower compared to adulthood, leading to higher bioaccumulation of toxicants.” Oral exploration: Babies put everything in their mouths, such as toys, fingers, and household objects. This increases how much dust and contaminants like flame retardants and PFAS they swallow.\n\nPFAS (“Forever Chemicals”) and Birth Outcomes\n\nBiomonitoring surveys confirm that between 97% and 100% of Americans have detectable PFAS in their blood. But the impact on moms and their babies is substantially greater than on older children and adults. A December 2025 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that pregnant women exposed to PFAS-contaminated drinking water faced dramatically higher risks of adverse birth outcomes:\n\n191% higher infant mortality rate in the first year of life\n\n168% higher rate of extremely preterm births, before 28 weeks\n\n180% higher rate of extremely low birth weight, of under 2.2 pounds\n\nThe researchers estimated that PFAS contamination costs the U.S. about $7.8 billion each year because of its effects on infant health. This is much higher than the $3.8 billion annual cost of removing these chemicals from public water supplies.\n\nHeavy Metals in Baby Food\n\nProgress has been made in reducing heavy metal levels in infant foods. In January 2025, the FDA issued final guidance about levels for lead in processed baby foods, the first enforceable standards for heavy metals in most baby food categories:\n\n10 parts per billion (ppb) for fruits, vegetables, mixtures, yogurts, and single-ingredient meats\n\n20 ppb for root vegetables and dry infant cereals\n\nIf baby food has more than these levels, the FDA considers it “adulterated.” For instance, arsenic in infant rice cereal remains a concern, but FDA tests show that manufacturers have significantly lowered these levels since 2011 by choosing their sources more carefully.\n\nMicroplastics from Baby Bottles\n\nA 2020 study in Nature Food found that polypropylene baby bottles can release up to 16.2 million microplastic particles per liter when heated for formula preparation. Bottle-fed infants may be exposed to an average of 1.5 million particles per day. North American and European infants are exposed to over 2 million particles daily due to lower breastfeeding rates.\n\nA 2024 review published in the journal Life suggests that microplastic risks may be greater for infants “because they do not have sufficiently developed metabolizing enzymes, have less ability to remove microplastics, and have highly sensitive target organs.”\n\nScientists are still studying the long-term health effects of microplastics, but new research links them to several serious health problems. A 2024 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that heart disease patients with microplastics in their carotid arteries were twice as likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or die within three years. Lab studies also suggest microplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier and may play a role in conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Other research connects microplastic exposure to breathing problems, metabolic disorders, changes in gut bacteria, reproductive issues, and liver disease.\n\nFor infants and children, early exposure may increase lifetime risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Taking protective measures during the first year is especially important.\n\n#1 Know the Worst Offenders\n\nUnderstanding common chemical classes helps you make informed choices:\n\nFlame retardants (PBDEs and OPFRs). Found in polyurethane foam, car seats, crib mattresses, nursing pillows, and changing pads, these chemicals are associated with dverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. While older PBDEs have been phased out, replacement organophosphate flame retardants are now “universally detected in human samples”.\n\nFound in polyurethane foam, car seats, crib mattresses, nursing pillows, and changing pads, these chemicals are associated with dverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

While BPA awareness has grown, replacement chemicals like BPS, BPF, and BHPF have nearly identical structures and potential effects. Research shows that young children have higher BPA exposure than older age groups. Avoid plastics numbered 3, 6, or 7.\n\nWhile BPA awareness has grown, replacement chemicals like BPS, BPF, and BHPF have nearly identical structures and potential effects.

Released from paints, furniture, carpets, and cleaning products, studies confirm that baby crib mattresses can be a significant source of VOC exposure.\n\n#2 Create a Healthier Nursery Environment\n\nWhere your baby sleeps is especially important, as infants spend 12 to 17 hours a day sleeping.\n\nChoose certified organic mattresses. Be sure to choose a mattress made with organic cotton, wool, and latex certified by GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and GOLS (Global Organic Latex Standard). GREENGUARD Gold certification indicates low chemical emissions, and MADE SAFE certification verifies that a product does not contain any of more than 6,500 restricted substances.\n\nBe sure to choose a mattress made with organic cotton, wool, and latex certified by GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and GOLS (Global Organic Latex Standard).

Keep humidity between 35% and 50% to prevent mold growth. Choose hard flooring over carpet. Carpets harbor dust mites, flame retardants, and other contaminants. If you have carpet, use a HEPA-filter vacuum weekly.\n\n#3 Reduce Microplastic Exposure\n\nSince 1950, more than 11 billion tons of plastic have been produced. Plastic shards and particles are found almost everywhere on the planet. But you can take steps to keep them away from your baby during the critical early years of their development.\n\nLet plastic bottles cool down after sterilizing them. High heat causes more microplastics to be released. After boiling, rinse bottles two or three times with room-temperature sterile water before adding formula.\n\nHigh heat causes more microplastics to be released.

Breastfeed when possible. While PFAS and some other chemicals can be transferred through breast milk, breastfeeding eliminates exposure to microplastics from bottles and remains the recommended approach to healthy feeding.\n\n#4 Filter Drinking Water\n\nWater makes up about 60% of the human body, so it is important to give your baby a healthy start with clean, chemical-free H2O.\n\nTest your water. Check whether your water system has detected PFAS in EWG’s Tap Water Database, or contact your utility for annual water quality reports.\n\nCheck whether your water system has detected PFAS in EWG’s Tap Water Database, or contact your utility for annual water quality reports. Install a water filtration system. Activated carbon filters can remove long-chain PFAS known as PFOA and PFOS. Reverse osmosis systems provide even more comprehensive filtration. Look for NSF-certified filters to reduce your baby’s exposure to PFAS.\n\nActivated carbon filters can remove long-chain PFAS known as PFOA and PFOS.

The 2025 PNAS study shows that PFAS in drinking water can have serious effects during pregnancy. Filtering water is especially important for pregnant women and when preparing infant formula.\n\n#5 Choose Nontoxic Toys\n\nWhat will your child spend the most time with during their early years? Toys, books, and you. Ensure that the things you put within their reach are toxin-free or, at a minimum, made with safe materials.\n\nLook for natural materials. Wood, natural rubber, organic cotton, and silicone are safer choices than plastic for mouthed items.\n\nWood, natural rubber, organic cotton, and silicone are safer choices than plastic for mouthed items.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission has a searchable database where you can look up recalled items.\n\n#6 Limit Baby Care Products\n\nResearch published in the journal Pediatrics found that using baby lotions and powders is linked to higher levels of phthalates in babies’ urine. You can lower your baby’s exposure to chemicals by following these simple steps.\n\nGo fragrance-free. “Fragrance” on labels can hide dozens of undisclosed chemicals, including phthalates. Choose products explicitly labeled “fragrance-free” and “phthalate-free.”\n\n“Fragrance” on labels can hide dozens of undisclosed chemicals, including phthalates.

Simple, unscented products work well when moisturizer is needed. Consider DIY alternatives. Coconut oil, shea butter, and other single-ingredient products offer moisturizing benefits without complex chemical formulations. Check out five DIY baby skin care recipes to turn your baby care toward natural ingredients.\n\n#7 Diversify Baby’s Diet\n\nThe FDA suggests giving infants and toddlers a varied diet. This helps lower the chance of too much exposure to any one contaminant.\n\nDon’t rely solely on rice cereal. Rice absorbs arsenic from soil more readily than other grains. Rotate with oat, barley, and multigrain cereals.\n\nRice absorbs arsenic from soil more readily than other grains. Rotate with oat, barley, and multigrain cereals.

Wash fruits and vegetables well. The Environmental Working Group says to wash produce for at least 20 seconds to help remove pesticides. Washing does not remove chemicals that are inside the plant, but it helps lower surface residues.\n\n#8 Control Household Dust\n\nFlame retardants, PFAS, and other chemicals are not tightly bound to products. They can move into household dust, which babies often swallow by putting their hands or objects in their mouths.\n\nDamp-mop floors regularly. Wet mopping picks up dust instead of spreading it into the air.\n\nWet mopping picks up dust instead of spreading it into the air. Vacuum with a HEPA filter.

Take off shoes at the door. Shoes can bring in outdoor contaminants like lead dust and pesticides.\n\nDuring Pregnancy\n\nChemical exposure during pregnancy can affect fetal development because the placenta does not block all harmful substances.\n\nAvoid renovating or painting during pregnancy, and if necessary, ensure excellent ventilation and use low-VOC products\n\nInvestigate water quality and install filtration before conception, if possible\n\nA 2024 NIEHS study found that folic acid supplementation may help mitigate some effects of prenatal chemical exposure on children’s liver health\n\nCar Seat Safety\n\nLook for car seats labeled as flame-retardant-free.\n\nAir out new car seats outdoors for several days before installing\n\nUse seat covers made from organic cotton to create a barrier between baby and the treated fabric\n\nClothing and Textiles\n\nWash all new clothing before baby wears it to remove manufacturing residues\n\nChoose GOTS-certified organic cotton for items that contact skin frequently (onesies, sleepwear, bibs)\n\nAvoid water-resistant or stain-resistant fabrics, which often contain PFAS treatments\n\nUse fragrance-free, dye-free laundry detergent\n\nCleaning Products\n\nSkip aerosol sprays and harsh chemical cleaners, especially in nursery areas\n\nSimple soap and water, white vinegar, and baking soda handle most cleaning needs\n\nVentilate well during and after cleaning\n\nCheck EWG’s Guide to Healthy Cleaning for product ratings\n\nSmall Changes for a Healthier Baby\n\nWhen protecting your baby from environmental chemicals, small changes can make a big difference. You do not have to change everything at once. Focus on the places where your baby spends the most time and on exposures you can easily control.\n\nOur understanding of the impact of industrial society on human helath is still developing, and regulations are slowly improving. The FDA’s decision on lead levels is a step forward, as is the EPA’s 2024 rule setting PFAS limits in drinking water. But these government actions don’t take place in a vacuum. Parents can push for stronger standards and make informed choices at home.\n\nEditor’s note: This article, originally published on December 2, 2019, was substantially updated in December 2025.",
