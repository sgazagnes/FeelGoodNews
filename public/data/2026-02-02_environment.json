      "title": "750-year-old Indian poems reveal a landscape scientists got wrong",
      "summary": "Old Indian poems and folk songs are revealing a surprising truth about the land. Scientists found that descriptions of thorny trees and open grasslands in texts written as far back as the 1200s closely match today’s savannas in western India. This suggests these landscapes are ancient and natural—not ruined forests. The discovery could reshape how conservation and tree-planting efforts are planned.",
      "content": "In the oldest known writing in Marathi, a language spoken by millions in western and central India, a 13th-century religious leader named Cakradhara points to an acacia tree as a symbol of death and rebirth. While his words were meant to convey spiritual meaning, they have taken on new significance centuries later.\n\nResearchers now say that writings like these can help explain the long history of India's landscapes. Ancient stories, poems, and songs may hold clues to how vast savannas and grasslands formed and endured across the region.\n\nRethinking the History of Grasslands\n\nSavannas and grasslands cover nearly 10% of India and more than one third of Earth's land surface. For decades, many scientists and policymakers assumed these open areas were once forests that had been cleared or degraded by human activity. That belief has shaped conservation strategies, including large-scale tree planting.\n\nNew research suggests a different story. Evidence from historical literature indicates that tropical grasslands are not ruined forests at all, but long-standing ecosystems in their own right. This distinction matters when deciding where reforestation efforts should focus.\n\nUsing Stories as Scientific Evidence\n\nIn a study published in the British Ecological Society journal People and Nature, scientists examined references to plants in historical narratives set in western India. Their goal was to reconstruct what kinds of vegetation existed there in the past.\n\n\"The take-home for me is how little things have changed,\" said study author Ashish Nerlekar of Michigan State University. \"It's fascinating that something hundreds of years old could so closely match what is around today and contrast so much with what people romanticize the past landscape to be.\"\n\nThe idea emerged during casual conversations between researchers from different fields. Digvijay Patil, a PhD student in archeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune, noticed repeated mentions of unusual plants while studying Sanskrit and Marathi texts related to sacred sites. Nerlekar, a plant scientist, recognized many of those plants as species still common in today's savannas.\n\nMapping Plants From Folk Songs and Poems\n\nThe research team began reviewing folk songs, poems, and myths written or performed in Marathi, some dating back to the 13th century. Much of this material is not stored in modern databases, making it an untapped source of ecological information.\n\nMany of the works are set in Maharashtra, where roughly 37,485 square kilometers are now open grasslands. That area is about two thirds the size of Lake Michigan.\n\n\"These areas are frequently misunderstood,\" said Nerlekar, a postdoctoral fellow in MSU's Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior Program.\n\nChallenging the \"Wasteland\" Label\n\nIn both public perception and official policy, savannas in India and elsewhere have often been labeled \"wastelands.\" They are commonly viewed as damaged forests and targeted for tree planting projects aimed at capturing carbon dioxide and slowing climate change.\n\nThe historical evidence tells a different story. The researchers identified references to 44 wild plant species in ancient texts, nearly two thirds of which are typical of savanna ecosystems.\n\nOne example appears in the epic poem \"Adi Parva,\" dated to about the 16th century. The text describes cowherders drawn to the \"empty\" and \"thorny\" Nira River valley because of its rich grass. Another account describes a taraṭī tree, known to scientists as Capparis divaricata, growing from the grave of a 15th-century poet-saint at the pilgrimage site of Pandharpur.\n\nThe acacia tree mentioned by Cakradhara also appears repeatedly. The team found eight references to this thorny species, known as Vachellia leucophloea, which has feathery leaves, pale yellow bark, and white flowers.\n\n\"It's a pretty iconic tree in the region, and it was common at that time also,\" Nerlekar said.\n\nA Landscape With Deep Roots\n\nTogether, these historical accounts suggest that India's savannas have existed for at least 750 years. They were already established long before widespread deforestation during British rule.\n\nOther scientific evidence points to an even deeper history. Fossil pollen and remains of grass-eating animals such as hippos indicate that savanna plants dominated the region tens of thousands of years ago, rather than dense forests.\n\nWhy Savannas Matter Today\n\nPreserving savannas and grasslands is important for many reasons, Nerlekar said. In India alone, these ecosystems support more than 200 plant species found nowhere else on Earth. Many were only recently identified by scientists and face growing threats from farming and development.\n\n\"A lot of savanna biodiversity is also sacred, which means they have cultural value in addition to ecological value,\" Nerlekar said.\n\nSavannas also help store carbon by absorbing carbon dioxide that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere. Across Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America, they provide grazing land for hundreds of millions of cattle, sheep, and other livestock.\n\nAbout 20% of the world's population depends on savannas and grasslands for their livelihoods. Researchers warn that these benefits could be lost if climate solutions involve planting trees in places where forests never existed.\n\n\"These centuries-old stories provide us a rare glimpse into the past, and that the past was a savanna past, not a forested past,\" Nerlekar said.\n\nThis research was supported by grants from Michigan State University and IISER Pune.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – For a long time, many scientists and policymakers thought that the open grasslands and savannas in western India were once forests that people had damaged or cleared. This belief affected how they planned conservation and tree-planting projects.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers studied old poems, folk songs, and stories written in Marathi, a language spoken in western India, some dating back 750 years. These texts describe thorny trees and open grasslands that match today’s savanna plants. Scientists found 44 plant species mentioned in the writings, many still common now. This shows these landscapes have existed naturally for centuries, not formed because of forest loss.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery changes how we understand Indian savannas. Instead of seeing them as damaged forests that need tree planting, we now know they are natural ecosystems with their own plants and animals. Savannas support many unique species and hold cultural importance. Protecting them correctly helps preserve biodiversity and supports climate efforts by storing carbon.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists and conservation groups may rethink where to plant trees and how to protect land. Instead of planting trees everywhere, they will focus on saving natural savannas and grasslands. This could lead to better plans that respect the true history and needs of these ecosystems.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Ancient poems show that western India’s savannas are natural landscapes, guiding better ways to protect and manage these important ecosystems.",

      "title": "Visiting Oregon? You may soon have to pay a tax to protect its wildlife.",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nWhen Oregon’s short legislative session convenes in early February, conservation advocates will once again try to convince lawmakers to pass a major funding bill that could provide nearly $30 million annually to protect the state’s biodiversity.\n\nThe 1% for Wildlife bill, sponsored by state representatives Ken Helm, a Democrat from Beaverton, and Mark Owens, a Republican from Crane, would increase the state’s current hotel and lodging taxes by 1.25 percent, creating a new revenue stream for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to support long-neglected habitat conservation programs. Last session, the bill passed the House, but two Republicans blocked it in the Senate.\n\nOregon’s federally required State Wildlife Action Plan identifies species at risk of extinction or decline due to habitat loss, climate change, and other threats. In 2025, as the plan was being updated, dozens of species were added, including the Crater Lake newt, the California condor, and the North American porcupine, bringing the total to more than 300.\n\n“It’s a blueprint of the most imperiled species and habitats in the state,” said Sristi Kamal, deputy director of the Western Environmental Law Center, which supports the bill. “But a plan is only as good as the funding to implement it.”\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nThough Oregon’s Fish and Wildlife Department receives some state funding, most of its budget comes from state hunting and fishing licenses and federal taxes on guns and ammunition via the Pittman-Robertson Act of 1937. The majority of Oregon’s federal funds, about $20 million annually, are earmarked for big game species and sport fish. Other federal grants primarily support species already protected by the Endangered Species Act. That means that Fish and Wildlife, like most state wildlife agencies, has little money to prevent species from becoming endangered in the first place. Between 2023 and 2025, it spent just 2 percent of its budget on wildlife conservation programs.\n\nDense mats of Ludwigia spp. choke out native vegetation at Horseshoe Lake, Palensky Wildlife Area, Oregon. Lauri Brewster/Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife\n\nIncreasing hotel and lodging taxes would leverage the state’s robust ecotourism industry, which annually attracts tens of thousands of out-of-state and international visitors.\n\nIf the bill passes, Oregon’s statewide hotel tax rate would be 2.5 percent — the third-lowest rate in the U.S. and less than half of what Washington, Montana, and Idaho charge. The 1% for Wildlife bill could provide a new model for state-level conservation funding, said Mark Humpert, director of conservation initiatives at the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, which advocates for state agencies at the federal level.\n\n“Ninety-five to 99 percent of species that states are responsible for have no dedicated funding from the federal government. We sometimes joke that state agencies have to offer bake sales to fund this work,” Humpert said. Some sell specialty license plates; others use a small percentage of sales taxes on outdoor equipment. The “gold standard,” Humpert said, is Missouri, where a state constitutional amendment dedicates one-eighth of 1 percent of its sales tax to its Department of Conservation.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nAccording to a 2016 study by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and its partners, fully implementing every State Wildlife Action Plan in the country would cost around $1 billion annually. But for years, Congress has failed to pass the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, a bipartisan bill that would bolster states’ conservation funding. Now, as the Trump administration slashes federal conservation and climate funding, advocates say that the 1% for Wildlife bill could provide the stable funding needed to implement Oregon’s wildlife action plan. “The bill is a very innovative concept, and there are probably 49 other states that are watching closely to see if it’s successful,” Humpert said.\n\nIn northeast Oregon’s high-desert region, Jamie Dawson, the Greater Hells Canyon Council’s conservation director, hopes the bill can fund wildlife crossings on Highway 82. “This section of the Blue Mountains is an absolutely critical habitat connectivity corridor — of continental importance,” Dawson said. Deer, elk, and other species use it to migrate between the Rocky Mountains and the Cascades Range in western Oregon and Washington. But the route is a wildlife collision hotspot, with hundreds of animals killed by vehicles over the past few years.\n\nElsewhere, the funding could support studies of migratory bird habitats like eel grass estuaries and wetlands, said Joe Liebezeit, conservation director for the Bird Alliance of Oregon. In spring 2025, local birdwatchers and radar data indicated that half as many birds as usual migrated through the state, though the reasons for this are unclear.\n\nAs the state’s general fund waxes and wanes, so does the wildlife department’s budget, which is rewritten every two years. The lack of stable conservation funding prevents it from focusing on long-term solutions for species conservation, said Davia Palmeri, the agency’s federal policy director. “We do monitoring for these species when we can — when there’s a grant or short-term funding — to get pulses on species like reptiles or amphibians.”\n\nFor over a decade, advocates have fought to secure state funding for conservation. “At one point, there was a proposal to put a tax on birdseed,” said Danielle Moser, wildlife program manager at Oregon Wild. “There was the idea of a gear tax — things you buy at REI.” But none of these ideas would have raised enough, and ultimately, they fizzled.\n\nLast year, two Republican senators, Daniel Bonham and Cedric Hayden, killed the bill by refusing to allow the final committee vote that would bring it to the governor’s desk. Now, conservation advocates from across the political spectrum are determined to pass it.\n\n“You won’t always see all these logos on the same page,” says Amy Patrick, policy director at the Oregon Hunters Association, which is working with conservation groups like Oregon Wild to shape the bill. “The goal of this funding is to keep common species common, and that’s something sportsmen can get behind. There’s a real sense that this is an investment that will benefit all of our wildlife and habitats.”\n\nThe current 1.5 percent tourism tax funds the $45 million annual budget of Travel Oregon, which promotes the state’s tourism industry. Travel Portland, an independent nonprofit that works with Travel Oregon, opposes the bill, arguing that the additional tax would discourage large conferences and events. (Update: Travel Oregon did not respond to a request for comment before publication, but in a later statement, the agency said that it does not take positions on bills.)\n\nThe Oregon Restaurant and Lodging Association called the bill a “Pandora’s box” of future tax increases. “We don’t see an end in sight, with all the other state agencies that would love a new revenue source,” said Jason Brandt, the association’s president. Brandt and others note that the bill’s original text only provided a 1 percent tax increase for the wildlife agency, but amendments tacked on 0.25 percent for conservation efforts by other departments, including the Department of Agriculture’s invasive species management and anti-poaching efforts at the Department of Justice.\n\nThe association’s political action committee donated over $17,000 to Bonham during his time in state office. Bonham, who resigned from the Senate in October when he was nominated to a federal position, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nKamal and other advocates say the tourism industry’s opposition is ironic, given that revenue from the new tax would be reinvested in some of the state’s most popular attractions. Travel Oregon’s surveys show that scenic beauty is the top draw for 90 percent of out-of-state visitors.\n\n“A lot of people come to Portland for business, but then they go to our beaches, or the mountains,” said Kamal. “The tourism industry is standing on the back of these natural resources. If you don’t invest in it, the pressures on these resources will make that legacy crumble.”\n\nThis story is part of High Country News’ Conservation Beyond Boundaries project, which is supported by the BAND Foundation.\n\n",
