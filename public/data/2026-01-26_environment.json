      "title": "UK to join major wind farm project with nine European countries",

      "content": "UK to join major wind farm project with nine European countries\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor Share Save\n\nAFP via Getty Images The new project could link offshore wind farms in the North Sea to more than one country via 'interconnectors'\n\nThe UK is set to back a vast new fleet of offshore wind projects in the North Sea alongside eight other European countries including Norway, Germany and the Netherlands. The government says the deal will strengthen energy security by offering an escape from what it calls the \"fossil fuel rollercoaster\". For the first time, some of the new wind farms will be linked to multiple countries through undersea cables known as interconnectors, which supporters say should lower prices across the region. But it could prove controversial as wind farm operators would be able to shop around between countries to sell power to the highest bidder - potentially driving up electricity prices when supply is tight.\n\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband will sign a declaration on Monday at a meeting on the future of the North Sea in the German city of Hamburg, committing to complete the scheme by 2050. Jane Cooper, deputy CEO of industry body RenewableUK, said the deal would \"drive down costs for billpayers\" as well as increasing \"the energy security of the UK and the whole of the North Sea region significantly\". But Claire Countinho, shadow energy secretary, warned \"we cannot escape the fact that the rush to build wind farms at breakneck speed is pushing up everybody's energy bills.\"\n\nNational Grid A valve hall inside a converter station that will form part of 'interconnector' onshore infrastructure\n\nA network of undersea cables already connect the electricity grids of European countries - the UK has 10 such cables - but connecting wind farms directly to multiple countries will be a first. Most energy economists agree more connections between the UK and other European grids should reduce costs and improve the security of supply. The UK National Grid published a paper earlier this month suggesting such an arrangement could cut so-called constraint payments, made when wind farms are asked not to generate power because the electricity network is too congested. A separate report said UK consumers had enjoyed savings of £1.6bn from the nine existing undersea cables linking the UK with Europe since 2023. National Grid said the cables help smooth spikes in prices because, thanks to time zone differences, surplus energy generated off-peak elsewhere can be sold cheaply to the UK. But interconnectors have proved controversial in Norway where there have been concerns that selling power to foreign countries could reduce supplies for Norwegian customers and therefore increase the price they pay. To stop this happening, the government brought in new rules to restrict electricity exports when domestic supply could be at risk. Norway also refused permission for a new interconnector to Scotland.\n\nNato and the European Commission are also taking part in the summit, which is expected to include pledges to strengthen security for offshore energy infrastructure amid rising concerns over sabotage and unsafe maritime activity. The agreement underlines Europe's continued commitment to wind power, despite renewed criticism from US President Donald Trump, who again attacked what he called \"windmills\" during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The North Sea countries pledged to develop 300 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity three years ago. This new deal means 100GW of the total will be built jointly. It is expected to say 20GW of that should be under way by 2030. China currently leads the world in offshore wind, with 43GW of the world's 83GW of installed capacity, according to a report last year from industry body RenewableUK. The UK ranks second, with almost 16GW already in operation. The UK government has awarded contracts for a further 20GW, including 8.4GW agreed in a record-breaking bidding round earlier this month. The government was criticised by the Conservatives for \"locking in\" high offshore wind prices. Reform has also repeatedly attacked the cost of net zero, but the Lib Dems and Greens both support the expansion of renewables to tackle the threat of climate change and boost green jobs. SNP and Plaid Cymru also support the growth of offshore wind, but argue Scotland and Wales should have control of their energy resources. Additional reporting by Miho Tanaka.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** –\nNine European countries, including the UK, Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands, are working together to build new offshore wind farms in the North Sea. These wind farms will be connected using undersea cables called interconnectors, linking them to more than one country for the first time.\n\n**What happened** –\nOn Monday, UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will sign an agreement in Hamburg to join this project. The plan is to complete the network by 2050, with 20 gigawatts (GW) of wind power under construction by 2030. Interconnectors will allow countries to share electricity generated by these wind farms, helping balance supply and demand.\n\n**Impact** –\nThis new connection between countries could lower electricity prices because surplus wind power can be sold where it is needed most. It also strengthens energy security by reducing reliance on fossil fuels, which can have unstable prices. For example, since 2023 the UK has saved £1.6 billion thanks to existing undersea cables. However, some worry that operators might sell power to the highest bidder, which could raise prices during shortages.\n\n**What's next step** –\nCountries will start building the joint wind farms and interconnector cables, aiming to reach 100GW of shared offshore wind capacity by 2050. The project also includes plans to protect offshore energy sites from threats like sabotage. This cooperation may inspire further partnerships to expand clean energy across Europe.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** –\nThe UK and nine European nations are creating a shared North Sea wind farm network using undersea cables to boost clean energy, improve supply, and help lower costs.\n",

Ces parcs seront reliés par des câbles sous-marins appelés interconnecteurs, les connectant pour la première fois à plusieurs pays.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** –\nLundi, le secrétaire britannique à l'Énergie, Ed Miliband, signera un accord à Hambourg pour rejoindre ce projet. L'objectif est de terminer le réseau d'ici 2050, avec 20 gigawatts (GW) de puissance éolienne en construction d'ici 2030. Les interconnecteurs permettront le partage de l'électricité produite entre pays, pour mieux équilibrer l'offre et la demande.\n\n**Impact** –\nCette nouvelle connexion pourrait faire baisser les prix de l'électricité car l'énergie éolienne excédentaire pourra être vendue là où elle est la plus nécessaire. Elle renforce aussi la sécurité énergétique en réduisant la dépendance aux combustibles fossiles aux prix instables. Par exemple, depuis 2023, le Royaume-Uni a économisé 1,6 milliard de livres grâce aux câbles sous-marins existants. Cependant, certains craignent que les opérateurs vendent l'électricité au plus offrant, ce qui pourrait augmenter les prix en cas de pénurie.\n\n**Prochaine étape** –\nLes pays commenceront à construire ensemble les parcs éoliens et les câbles interconnecteurs, visant 100GW de capacité partagée d'ici 2050. Le projet prévoit aussi de protéger les installations énergétiques en mer contre les menaces comme le sabotage.

      "summary": "After analyzing 40 years of tree records across the Andes and Amazon, researchers found that climate change is reshaping tropical forests in uneven ways. Some regions are steadily losing tree species, especially where conditions are hotter and drier, while others are seeing gains. Rainfall patterns turned out to be just as important as rising temperatures.",
      "content": "A new study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution shows that tropical forests across the Amazon and Andes have experienced major changes in tree diversity in recent decades as global environmental conditions continue to shift.\n\nThe research was led by Dr. Belen Fadrique of the University of Liverpool and is based on 40 years of detailed tree records. These data were collected by hundreds of botanists and ecologists working in long-term forest plots, providing one of the most comprehensive assessments yet of how tree diversity is changing in some of the most biologically rich forests on Earth.\n\nOverall Stability Hides Regional Declines and Gains\n\nWhen researchers looked at tree diversity across South America as a whole, they found that total species richness has remained mostly stable. However, this apparent balance conceals strong regional differences.\n\nIn several large areas, tree diversity has declined over time, while other regions have seen an increase in the number of species. These contrasting patterns reveal that climate change is affecting tropical forests in uneven ways rather than producing uniform outcomes.\n\nHotter and Drier Forests Lose Species\n\nThe analysis showed that forests exposed to higher temperatures, drier conditions, and stronger seasonal changes were more likely to lose tree species. In contrast, forests with healthier ecosystems and naturally dynamic conditions often gained species over the same period.\n\nThe strongest losses were observed in the Central Andes, the Guyana Shield, and Central Eastern Amazon forests, where most long-term monitoring plots recorded declines. Meanwhile, the Northern Andes and Western Amazon stood out as regions where tree species numbers increased in most plots.\n\nWhile rising temperatures had a broad influence on tree diversity, the study found that rainfall levels and seasonal rainfall patterns played a critical role in shaping these regional trends.\n\nNorthern Andes Emerges as a Potential Climate Refuge\n\nOne of the most important findings is the identification of the Northern Andes as a possible \"refuge\" for tree species affected by climate change. As environmental conditions worsen in other areas, this region may provide shelter for species displaced from surrounding forests.\n\nThe research team analyzed data covering the South American tropics, a region that contains more than 20,000 tree species.\n\nTheir work spans ten countries and includes 406 long-term floristic plots that have been measured repeatedly since the 1970s and 1980s. These rare and consistent records allowed scientists to track changes in tree species richness over time and identify the key environmental factors driving those changes for the first time at this scale.\n\nHow Plant Species Respond to a Warming Climate\n\nPlant species have limited ways to cope with climate change. They can shift their geographic ranges as conditions change, or they can adapt to new environments where they already grow. When species are unable to move or adjust, their populations may decline, increasing the risk of extinction.\n\nDr. Fadrique is a Dorothy Hodgkin Royal Society and University of Liverpool Research Fellow with the Department of Geography & Planning. She is the study's lead author and carried out the research while she was a Marie Curie Fellow at the University of Leeds.\n\nShe said, \"Our work assessing species responses to climate change points to profound changes in forest composition, and species richness at multiple scales.\"\n\nFlavia Costa, Professor at INPA (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia) in Brazil, added, \"This study underscores the uneven impacts of climate change on tree diversity across different tropical forests, highlighting the need for specific monitoring and conservation efforts in each region.\"\n\nProfessor Oliver Phillips of the University of Leeds, who leads the pan-Amazon RAINFOR network, emphasized the added threat of deforestation. He said, \"Our findings stress the vital links between preserving forests, protecting biodiversity, and fighting climate change. It is especially critical to protect remaining forests where the Amazon meets the Andes. Only if they stay standing can they offer a long-term home to species in adjacent lowlands.\"\n\nWhat the Team Plans to Study Next\n\nThe researchers plan to continue investigating how climate change is reshaping tropical tree diversity.\n\nDr. Fadrique said, \"Future studies will focus on complex compositional questions, including the taxonomic and functional identities of species being lost or recruited, and whether this points to a large-scale process of homogenization within the Andes-Amazon region.\"\n\nThe study was the result of an international collaboration involving more than 160 researchers from 20 countries. Many contributions came from South American universities and research partners. The work was supported by major research networks, including RAINFOR, Red de Bosques Andinos, the Madidi Project, and the PPBio network.",

My parents are farmers. I witnessed a lot of harvests, but when climate change started happening, we could not understand what was happening. Since our source of income was farming, when the harvest was bad, it directly affected our quality of life, and it meant that we could not go to school.\n\nI always wanted to offer solutions to my parents and other people from farming families. That is what inspired me to start my company and get people who are like-minded to build this solution to support smallholder farmers.\n\nGreenovations Africa, an initiative supported by the UN which supports women entrepreneurs like myself, was a very important part of the process, because they believed in companies that are small and offered them training and seed capital to help them grow.\n\nGiving up is not an option\n\nIn Africa, communities are quite patriarchal. So, trying to get into this male-dominated field is a thing. It is hard. It has its own challenges, because people would rather work with a man. They feel that men understand what you do better than you do. In many places, they do not believe in female leadership; Even women offering solutions is not a thing they would take up.\n\nWhat really helped me on this journey was persistence and having training and demonstrations to show what we do and that we know what we are doing. You cannot give up. Collaborate with the people you meet and eventually it will work out.\n\nIt is also important to keep your eyes on why you started; knowing that my parents are no longer struggling and thinking about the millions of children whose parents are farmers, and the futures of those children that would be jeopardized if their parents don't have stable incomes.\n\nSometimes you look at how far you have come and think, giving up is not an option. So many people depend on you. That is what keeps me focused.\n\nThe reward\n\nMy highest point is when I see lives changed directly.\n\nWhen you empower farmers, their lives change.\n\nWhen you see a direct increase in crop yields or when people are no longer struggling, it makes you want to work even harder.\n\nWhen you see that the farmer, who did not even have the money to buy seeds, is in control of the prices they sell their harvest on, that is very encouraging for me.\n\nThe call to others\n\nTo other women and girls who want to innovate in agriculture or climate action, I would just say go for it.\n\nYou will learn along the way, and there are a lot of people who will support you financially or offer technical support, advice, and training. There is no right time to start, and you will never be prepared enough - you just have do it…don’t be scared!”",
