      "title": "Hypersonic breakthrough could enable planes that fly 10 times the speed of sound",
      "summary": "Hypersonic flight could one day make long-haul travel as quick as a short movie. Researchers are testing how turbulence behaves at extreme speeds, a critical hurdle for designing these aircraft. Their laser-based krypton experiments suggest turbulence at Mach 6 behaves more like slower airflow than expected. The results could simplify hypersonic vehicle design and accelerate progress toward ultra-fast travel.",
      "content": "If it ever becomes achievable, hypersonic flight could dramatically reshape international travel. What currently requires an entire day could become a short trip lasting no more than a feature length movie. A route such as Sydney to Los Angeles, which now takes about 15 hours, might be reduced to only one hour.\n\n\"It really shrinks the planet,\" says Professor Nicholaus Parziale, whose work centers on turning hypersonic travel from aspiration into reality. Parziale recently received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in recognition of his research into fluid mechanics at extreme speeds. \"It will make travel faster, easier and more enjoyable.\"\n\nThe Challenges of Flying at Mach 10\n\nCovering half the world in just one hour may seem impossible, yet the technology is not as far away as it appears. Some military aircraft already reach speeds of Mach 2 or Mach 3, which means two or three times the speed of sound. Mach 1 equals about 760 miles per hour. To travel from Los Angeles to Sydney in sixty minutes, an aircraft would need to reach Mach 10. The major obstacles are the extraordinary turbulence and heat produced during flight at these extreme speeds.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between how air behaves around an aircraft at lower speeds and how it behaves at higher speeds. Engineers describe these conditions as incompressible flow and compressible flow. In incompressible flow, which occurs at lower speeds (below about Mach 0.3 or 225 miles per hour), the density of the air stays nearly the same. This consistency simplifies aeronautical design. Once an aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound, the airflow becomes compressible instead. \"That's because a gas can 'squish,'\" Parziale explains, meaning it can compress.\n\nWhy Airflow Behavior Matters for Hypersonic Design\n\nWhen air compresses, its density changes in response to variations in both pressure and temperature. These shifts influence how an aircraft interacts with the air around it. \"Compressibility affects how the airflow goes around the body and that can change things like lift, drag, and thrust required to take off or stay airborne.\" All of these factors play a major role in aircraft design.\n\nEngineers already understand airflow fairly well for aircraft that fly below or near the speed of sound, a range called \"low Mach\" numbers. Creating hypersonic aircraft requires a much deeper understanding of how air behaves at Mach 5, Mach 6, or even Mach 10. Much of that behavior is still uncertain, except for guidance provided by Morkovin's hypothesis.\n\nMorkovin's Hypothesis and the Mystery of Hypersonic Turbulence\n\nDeveloped by Mark Morkovin in the mid 20th century, the hypothesis proposes that when air moves around Mach 5 or Mach 6, the fundamental nature of turbulence remains surprisingly similar to turbulence at lower speeds. Although high-speed airflow involves larger shifts in temperature and density, Morkovin suggested that the general pattern of turbulent motion stays mostly consistent. \"Basically, the Morkovin's hypothesis means that the way the turbulent air moves at low and high speeds isn't that different,\" Parziale says. \"If the hypothesis is correct, it means that we don't need a whole new way to understand turbulence at these higher speeds. We can use the same concepts we use for the slower flows.\" This also suggests that future hypersonic aircraft may not require a completely different design philosophy.\n\nDespite its importance, the hypothesis has lacked solid experimental validation. That gap led to Parziale's recent research, described in his study Hypersonic Turbulent Quantities in Support of Morkovin's Hypothesis, published in Nature Communications on November 12, 2025.\n\nA Laser and Krypton Experiment Eleven Years in the Making\n\nIn the study, Parziale's team introduced krypton gas into a wind tunnel and used lasers to ionize it. This process briefly created a straight, glowing line formed by the krypton atoms. High-resolution cameras then captured how this illuminated line bent, twisted, and distorted as it moved through the airflow, similar to how a leaf drifts and spins within small swirling currents in a river.\"As that line moves with the gas, you can see crinkles and structure in the flow, and from that, we can learn a lot about turbulence,\" Parziale says. He notes that developing the experimental setup required 11 years of effort. \"And what we found was that at Mach 6, the turbulence behavior is pretty close to the incompressible flow.\"\n\nParziale's group received early support from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Research Program (YIP) in 2016 and from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) YIP in 2020, with the latest work also funded by ONR.\n\nWhat the Findings Mean for Future Flight and Space Access\n\nWhile Morkovin's hypothesis is not yet completely proven, the new results move scientists closer to understanding how to design aircraft that can withstand hypersonic speeds. The findings indicate that engineers may not need to reinvent the fundamental approach to aircraft design for these extreme conditions, which simplifies the challenge significantly.\n\n\"Today, we must use computers to design an airplane, and the computational resources to design a plane that will fly at Mach 6, simulating all the tiny, fine, little details would be impossible,\" Parziale explains. \"The Morkovin's hypothesis allows us to make simplifying assumptions so that the computational demands to design hypersonic vehicles can become more doable.\"\n\nParziale adds that the same principles could transform future access to space. \"If we can build planes that fly at hypersonic speed, we can also fly them into space, rather than launching rockets, which would make transportation to and from low Earth orbit easier,\" he says. \"It will be a game-changer for transportation not only on earth, but also in low orbit.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists want to create planes that fly at hypersonic speeds, which means traveling more than five times the speed of sound. Flying this fast could cut long trips, like Sydney to Los Angeles, from 15 hours to just one hour. But flying so fast is hard because the air around the plane behaves in tricky ways, creating strong turbulence and heat.\n\n**What happened** – Professor Nicholaus Parziale and his team studied how air moves around planes flying at Mach 6 (six times the speed of sound). Using a special experiment with lasers and krypton gas in a wind tunnel, they watched how turbulence behaves at these extreme speeds. Their results showed that turbulence at Mach 6 is more like the airflow seen at slower speeds than scientists expected.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it means engineers might not need to completely change how they design planes for hypersonic speeds. Instead, they can use similar ideas already used for slower aircraft. This simplifies the design process, making it easier and faster to develop hypersonic planes. It could also help create vehicles that can fly into space more easily, changing how we travel both on Earth and beyond.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will use this new understanding to improve computer models that design hypersonic aircraft. These better models will help build planes that can safely fly at extreme speeds.

      "title": "Breakthrough shows light can move atoms in 2D semiconductors",
      "summary": "Laser light can physically distort Janus TMD materials, revealing how their asymmetrical structure amplifies light-driven forces. These effects could power breakthroughs in photonic chips, sensors, and tunable light technologies.",
      "content": "Researchers at Rice University have found that certain atom-thin semiconductors, known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), can physically shift their atomic lattice when exposed to light. This newly observed response offers a controllable way to tune the behavior and properties of these ultrathin materials.\n\nThe phenomenon appears in a subtype of TMDs called Janus materials, named for the Roman god associated with transitions. Their light sensitivity could support future technologies that rely on optical signals instead of electrical currents, including faster and cooler computer chips, highly responsive sensors and flexible optoelectronic systems.\n\n\"In nonlinear optics, light can be reshaped to create new colors, faster pulses or optical switches that turn signals on and off,\" said Kunyan Zhang, a Rice doctoral alumna and first author of the study. \"Two-dimensional materials, which are only a few atoms thick, make it possible to build these optical tools on a very small scale.\"\n\nWhat Makes Janus Materials Different\n\nTMDs are built from stacked layers of a transition metal such as molybdenum and two layers of a chalcogen element like sulfur or selenium. Their blend of conductivity, strong light absorption and mechanical flexibility has made them key candidates for next-generation electronic and optical devices.\n\nWithin this group, Janus materials stand apart because their top and bottom atomic layers are composed of different chemical elements, giving them an asymmetric structure. This imbalance produces a built-in electrical polarity and increases their sensitivity to light and external forces.\n\n\"Our work explores how the structure of Janus materials affects their optical behavior and how light itself can generate a force in the materials,\" Zhang said.\n\nDetecting Atomic Motion With Laser Light\n\nTo investigate this behavior, the team used laser beams of various colors on a two-layer Janus TMD material composed of molybdenum sulfur selenide stacked on molybdenum disulfide. They examined how it alters light through second harmonic generation (SHG), a process in which the material emits light at twice the frequency of the incoming beam. When the incoming laser matched the material's natural resonances, the usual SHG pattern became distorted, revealing that the atoms were shifting.\n\n\"We discovered that shining light on Janus molybdenum sulfur selenide and molybdenum disulfide creates tiny, directional forces inside the material, which show up as changes in its SHG pattern,\" Zhang said. \"Normally, the SHG signal forms a six-pointed 'flower' shape that mirrors the crystal's symmetry. But when light pushes on the atoms, this symmetry breaks -- the petals of the pattern shrink unevenly.\"\n\nOptostriction and Layer Coupling\n\nThe researchers traced the SHG distortion to optostriction, a process in which the electromagnetic field of light applies a mechanical force on atoms. In Janus materials, the strong coupling between layers magnifies this effect, allowing even extremely small forces to produce measurable strain.\n\n\"Janus materials are ideal for this because their uneven composition creates an enhanced coupling between layers, which makes them more sensitive to light's tiny forces -- forces so small that it is difficult to measure directly, but we can detect them through changes in the SHG signal pattern,\" Zhang said.\n\nPotential for Future Optical Technologies\n\nThis high sensitivity suggests that Janus materials could become valuable components in a wide range of optical technologies. Devices that guide or control light using this mechanism may lead to faster, more energy-efficient photonic chips, since light-based circuits produce less heat than traditional electronics. Similar properties could be used to build finely tuned sensors that detect extremely small vibrations or pressure shifts, or to develop adjustable light sources for advanced displays and imaging systems.\n\n\"Such active control could help design next-generation photonic chips, ultrasensitive detectors or quantum light sources -- technologies that use light to carry and process information instead of relying on electricity,\" said Shengxi Huang, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and materials science and nanoengineering at Rice and a corresponding author of the study. Huang is also affiliated with the Smalley-Curl Institute, the Rice Advanced Materials Institute and the Ken Kennedy Institute.\n\nSmall Structural Imbalances With Big Impact\n\nBy demonstrating how the internal asymmetry of Janus TMDs creates new ways to influence the flow of light, the study shows that tiny structural differences can unlock significant technological opportunities.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Science Foundation (2246564, 1943895), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA9550-22-1-0408), the Welch Foundation (C-2144), the U.S. Department of Energy (DE‐SC0020042, DE-AC02-05CH11231), the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA2386-24-1-4049) and the Taiwan Ministry of Education.

Now, a team in China has developed a system called AI-Newton that, after being fed experimental data, can autonomously ‘discover’ key physics principles, such as Newton’s second law describing the effect of force and mass on acceleration.\n\nThe model mimics the human scientific process by incrementally building a knowledge base of concepts and laws, says Yan-Qing Ma, a physicist at Peking University in Beijing who helped to develop the system. Being able to identify useful concepts means that the system can potentially discover scientific insights without human pre-programming, Ma adds.\n\nKeyon Vafa, a computer scientist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, explains that AI-Newton uses an approach called symbolic regression, in which the model hunts for the best mathematical equation to represent physical phenomena. This technique is a promising method for scientific discovery, he adds, because the system is programmed in a way that encourages it to deduce concepts.\n\nThe team at Peking University used a simulator to generate data from 46 physics experiments1 involving the free motion of balls and springs, collisions between objects and the behaviour of systems exhibiting vibrations, oscillations and pendulum-like motion. The simulator also deliberately introduced statistical errors to mimic real-world data.\n\nFor example, AI-Newton was given data on the position of a ball at a given time and asked to come up with a mathematical equation that explains the relationship between the two variables of time and position. It was able to provide an equation for velocity. It stored this knowledge for the next set of tasks, in which it successfully derived the mass of the ball using Newton’s second law. The results have not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nPlanetary trajectories\n\nScientists have previously used AI models to predict planetary orbits. In 2019, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich developed ‘AI Copernicus’, a neural network that used Earth-based observations to derive formulae for planetary trajectories. In that case, humans were needed to interpret the equations and understand how they relate to the movement of the planets around the Sun.\n\nVafa and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, tried a similar experiment with several foundation models, a type of AI model trained on vast data sets, including large language models such as GPT, Claude and Llama.\n\nThey trained the models to predict the location of planets across solar systems and then asked them to predict the forces that govern planetary trajectories. In a preprint2, the researchers showed that when the models were trained on orbital trajectories, they could not use the knowledge to do any task other than predicting planetary trajectories. When trying to turn that orbital trajectory data into a law about how forces behave, the foundation AI models derived a nonsensical law of gravitation.",

With its open-source code, HDTN paves the way for collaboration, innovation, and adoption across the rapidly expanding commercial space industry, offering near real-time communication capabilities.\n\nLooking ahead, HDTN could form the foundation of a solar system-wide internet, supporting data exchange between Earth, spacecraft, and even future missions involving human travel to the Moon and Mars.\n\nVulcanAlloy\n\nIn a project led by the University of Pittsburgh, researchers at NASA Glenn, including Nick Bruno, Grant Feichter, Vladimir Keylin, Alex Leary, and Ron Noebe, partnered with CorePower Magnetics to develop VulcanAlloy — a breakthrough soft magnetic nanocrystalline material.\n\nNASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland tested high-temperature inductors using VulcanAlloy technology in the NASA Glenn Extreme Environments Rig, which simulates the conditions on Venus’ surface, on May 13, 2025. Credit: NASA\n\nVulcanAlloy, developed under NASA’s High Operating Temperature Technology Program using processing capability established by the Advanced Air Transport Technology project, operates above 500°C, far beyond the limits of conventional soft magnetic materials. Its nano-engineered structure maintains efficiency at high temperatures and frequencies.\n\nWith adjustable magnetic properties, it can replace multiple materials in components like inductors, transformers, motors, and sensors while reducing the need for bulky cooling systems — ideal for extreme environments.\n\nRaytheon has tested VulcanAlloy cores, highlighting their potential in electrified aircraft, defense, and aerospace systems.\n\nThis innovation also promises major impact in electric vehicles, data centers, microgrids, and energy systems, where smaller, lighter, and more efficient components are key to advancing next-generation power electronics.\n\nThe R&D 100 Awards, a worldwide science and innovation competition, received entries from organizations around the world. Now in its 63rd year, this year’s judging panel included industry professionals from across the globe who evaluated breakthrough innovations in technology and science.",
