      "content": "Puppy farm ban promised by animal welfare strategy\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Malcolm Prior , rural affairs producer and Duncan Kennedy , correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images The government has vowed to end puppy farming as part of a wide-ranging animal welfare strategy\n\nAn end to puppy farming and a possible ban on the use of electric shock dog collars are promised as part of a new animal welfare strategy being launched by the government on Monday. The strategy - which packages together new laws with legislative reforms and proposals - will also progress Labour's manifesto pledge to ban trail hunting in the countryside. The RSPCA has welcomed the plans to outlaw puppy farming but the Countryside Alliance has condemned the ban on trail hunting as \"another attack on the countryside\". Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds told the BBC there would be consultation on the trail-hunting ban, which was \"sometimes used as a smokescreen\" for illegal fox hunting.\n\nGetty Images The Countryside Alliance said a ban on trail hunting was \"completely unnecessary\"\n\nPuppy farming is the term used when breeders prioritise profit over animal health and welfare, often keeping large numbers of dogs in small pens and using them to produce multiple litters a year. Current dog breeding practices will be reformed to tackle puppy farming as part of what the government calls \"the biggest animal welfare reforms in a generation\". However, the whole strategy will not be delivered until the end of 2030. David Bowles, head of public affairs at the RSPCA, said the animal welfare charity was \"delighted\" at the strategy and added that the plans to ban puppy farming \"could be a real game-changer\". \"Puppy farming is one of the most insidious problems that the RSPCA faces. \"The government will need to write the legislation on that in this coming year and the RSPCA will work with them to make sure that there are no loopholes,\" he said. The government is also looking to ban the use of snare traps in the countryside and on Sunday confirmed it is to carry out a consultation on the proposed ban on trail hunting in the New Year. Trail hunting involves using a rag with a natural scent on to lay a trail ahead of a hunt, which is then followed by the hounds but live animal scents could be picked up by the pack instead. The secretary of state told the BBC that while Labour had previously banned fox hunting in 2004 \"we have seen that people are trying to get around that ban by using trail hunting in some cases\". \"Obviously that's also a problem of enforcement, it's not just the legislation, but we are determined to go further, which is why banning trail hunting is in the animal welfare strategy,\" she said. \"We know sometimes it is used as a smokescreen for fox hunting.\"\n\n'Divisive issue'",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Puppy farming is when dogs are kept in poor conditions just to have many puppies, often harming their health. The government has been under pressure to improve animal welfare laws to stop such cruelty.\n\n**What happened** – The government announced a new animal welfare strategy that includes banning puppy farms and possibly electric shock dog collars. The plan also aims to ban trail hunting, where dogs follow a scent trail instead of live animals, which some say can hide illegal fox hunting. These changes are part of what the government calls the biggest animal welfare reforms in a generation and will be introduced gradually until 2030.\n\n**Impact** – This strategy is important because it targets common animal abuses like puppy farming and harmful training tools. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) praised the plan, saying it could greatly improve how dogs are treated. It also shows the government’s commitment to better protect animals and change long-standing practices.\n\n**What's next step** – The government will work on new laws over the next year and consult the public about banning trail hunting. Animal welfare groups will help ensure the new rules are strong and clear, closing any loopholes that might allow bad practices to continue.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The government’s new animal welfare strategy promises major changes to end puppy farming and reduce cruelty to dogs by 2030.\n",

      "title": "Science says we’ve been nurturing “gifted” kids all wrong",
      "summary": "A major international review has upended long-held ideas about how top performers are made. By analyzing nearly 35,000 elite achievers across science, music, chess, and sports, researchers found that early stars rarely become adult superstars. Most world-class performers developed slowly and explored multiple fields before specializing. The message is clear: talent grows through variety, not narrow focus.",
      "content": "Exceptional performers play a major role in driving innovation and tackling some of the world's most urgent challenges. Because of this, societies have a strong stake in understanding how top-level talent develops. A new review published in the journal Science argues that many long standing approaches to gifted education and talent development rest on flawed assumptions. For the first time, an international and interdisciplinary research team has brought together evidence on how world-class performers emerge in science, classical music, chess, and sports.\n\nFor decades, research on giftedness and expertise has followed a familiar model. Outstanding achievement was thought to depend on strong early performance, such as excelling in school subjects, sports, or concerts, combined with specific abilities like intelligence, physical coordination, or musical talent. These traits were believed to need years of intense, discipline-focused training to produce elite results. As a result, many talent programs concentrate on identifying the top young performers early and pushing them to specialize quickly.\n\nAccording to new findings led by Arne Güllich, professor of sports science at RPTU University Kaiserslautern-Landau, this approach may not be the most effective way to nurture future high achievers.\n\nWhy Earlier Research Missed the Full Picture\n\nUntil recently, most studies of giftedness focused on young or sub-elite performers. These groups included school and college students, youth athletes, young chess players, and musicians training at conservatories. However, evidence drawn from adult world-class athletes has begun to challenge conclusions based on these earlier samples.\n\n\"Traditional research into giftedness and expertise did not sufficiently consider the question of how world-class performers at peak performance age developed in their early years,\" Arne Güllich explains. The goal of the new Review was to address this gap by examining how elite performers actually progressed over time.\n\nTo do this, Güllich worked with an international research team that included Michael Barth, assistant professor of sports economics at the University of Innsbruck, D. Zach Hambrick, professor of psychology at Michigan State University, and Brooke N. Macnamara, professor of psychology at Purdue University. Their findings are now published in Science.\n\nPooling Evidence Across Fields\n\nThe researchers reexamined large datasets from many previous studies, analyzing the developmental histories of 34,839 top-level performers from around the world. The group included Nobel Prize winners in the sciences, Olympic medalists, elite chess players, and leading classical music composers. This effort made it possible, for the first time, to compare how world-class performers develop across very different disciplines.\n\nEarly Stars Are Rarely Future Legends\n\nOne of the most striking conclusions is that elite performers follow a developmental path that differs from long-held assumptions. \"And a common pattern emerges across the different disciplines,\" Güllich notes.\n\nFirst, individuals who stand out as the best at a young age are usually not the same people who become the best later in life. Second, those who eventually reached the highest levels tended to improve gradually during their early years and were not top performers within their age group. Third, future world-class achievers typically did not focus on a single discipline early on. Instead, they explored a range of activities, such as different academic subjects, musical genres, sports, or professions (e.g., different subjects of study, genres of music, sports, or professions).\n\nHow Variety Builds Stronger Performers\n\nThe researchers propose three ideas that may help explain these patterns. \"We propose three explanatory hypotheses for discussion,\" says Güllich.\n\nThe search-and-match hypothesis suggests that exposure to multiple disciplines increases the likelihood of eventually finding the best personal fit. The enhanced-learning-capital hypothesis proposes that learning in diverse areas strengthens overall learning capacity, making it easier to continue improving later at the highest level within a chosen field. The limited-risks hypothesis argues that engaging in multiple disciplines reduces the chance of setbacks such as burnout, unhealthy work-rest imbalances, loss of motivation, or physical injury in psychomotor disciplines (sports, music).\n\nArne Güllich summarizes the combined effect of these factors: \"Those who find an optimal discipline for themselves, develop enhanced potential for long-term learning, and have reduced risks of career-hampering factors, have improved chances of developing world-class performance.\"\n\nEncouraging Breadth Instead of Early Specialization\n\nBased on these findings, Güllich offers clear guidance on how young talent should be supported. The evidence suggests avoiding early specialization in a single field. Instead, young people should be encouraged and given opportunities to explore several areas of interest and receive support in two or three disciplines.\n\nThese areas do not need to be closely related. Combinations like language and mathematics, or geography and philosophy, can be equally valuable. Albert Einstein provides a famous example -- one of the most important physicists, who was also deeply engaged with music and played the violin from an early age.\n\nImplications for Policy and Practice\n\nThe authors argue that these insights should inform changes in how talent development programs are designed. Policymakers and program leaders can move toward approaches grounded in evidence rather than tradition.\n\nAs Güllich concludes, \"This may enhance opportunities for the development of world-class performers -- in science, sports, music, and other fields.\"",

      "content": "Singing at school shouldn't just be for Christmas, teachers say\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Kate McGough Education reporter Share Save\n\nDan Nelson / BBC\n\nMany children find themselves singing at school in the run up to Christmas - at a nativity play or carol concert, often with parents watching proudly on. But new data suggests singing is a much less common occurrence throughout the rest of the school year, especially after pupils leave primary school. Now, an association of music teachers says every school should have a choir, to help pupils embrace music after a years-long decline in its popularity as a GCSE subject. The government says it is investing in high quality music teaching and that a \"renewed curriculum\" will encourage more people to study it.\n\nIn a recent survey, Teacher Tapp asked just under 10,000 teachers in England how often their whole school sang together in assembly. Over half of state secondary school teachers (57%) said their pupils never sang together in assembly, while just 13% of private secondary school teachers and only 4% of primary teachers said the same. Teachers were separately asked whether their schools had a choir. Just over a third (36%) of teachers at state secondaries reported having no choir at their school, compared to just 8% of private school secondary teachers. Having access to multiple school choirs was much more common at private schools, with three quarters (77%) of private secondary teachers saying their school had more than one choir, compared to 27% of state secondary teachers. Jackie Bowen, head teacher at The East Manchester Academy, says secondary school pupils can feel \"embarrassed - or that maybe it's not cool to sing like it was in primary school\". But she says singing and music are priorities at the school.\n\nDan Nelson / BBC Jackie Bowen says music is part of the fabric of school life for her pupils\n\n\"We know the intrinsic value of music, but also what it does for students' development, mental health, its impact on academic achievements,\" she says. \"So we've run lots of initiatives to try and break down barriers to music.\" The school offers a music hub at the school once a week, offering pupils time with specialist teachers from the Royal Northern College of Music. At lesson changeover, students hear classical music instead of the traditional bell. The school has also established its first gospel choir. Year 11 student Mercy, who's part of the choir, says she always wanted to continue singing at secondary school. \"In primary they say you have to sing, but when you come to secondary it's a choice, so most people don't do it,\" she says. \"I feel like we should all release our voices to the world. Whether you're good or not, just sing.\"\n\nKate McGough / BBC Mercy is part of her school's gospel choir and says she enjoys singing\n\nThere has been a 25% drop in pupils studying GCSE music at schools in England over the last fifteen years, despite an uptick in the most recent stats. That is partly down to the introduction of a progress measure for schools called the English Baccalaureate in 2010, which assessed schools based on how many pupils took English, maths, sciences, geography or history and a language - and how well they performed. The government recently announced that it would be changing the school curriculum in England to make it easier for more schools to offer arts subjects like music. There has been some improvement in recruiting new music teachers this year, but the levels still fall 35% short of government's target for trainee music teachers in the most recent stats. James Manwaring, president of the Music Teachers Association - which represents music teachers across both state and private schools - says every school should have a choir. \"All you need is a room and you need someone to lead it and you need students,\" says James, who is also the director of music at Windsor Learning Partnership - a multi-academy trust of six state schools. \"It's a shame to think some state schools aren't capitalising on that.\" He says changes to the school curriculum in England are \"very exciting\" for boosting music in schools, but says more funding and resources will be needed - \"as well as retaining the wonderful music teachers we have out there\".\n\nDan Nelson / BBC Music teacher Rob Hatton set up the gospel choir for students at The East Manchester Academy",
