      "content": "'We want to spread the word about women at war'\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Jeremy Ball Social affairs correspondent, BBC East Midlands Share Save\n\nBex Bennett Dr Bex Bennett is the co-founder of Sisters in Service\n\nA former soldier who came under mortar fire in Iraq says women who performed dangerous front-line roles need more recognition and support. Dr Bex Bennett, from Derbyshire, co-founded community interest company Sisters in Service, which has recruited 160 members across the UK since it began in May last year. The group helps female military veterans, who now work in healthcare, to support each other through meetings and activities. Dr Bennett, now an NHS forensic psychiatrist in Nottinghamshire, says women face additional challenges because so few people understand their military experience.\n\nDr Bennett trained at Sandhurst with the Duke of Sussex and spent several years as a British Army officer with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. A separate deployment in southern Afghanistan involved travelling to remote bases and interacting with local communities. She believes many people still have a \"very outdated idea\" that only men deploy to the front line in modern conflicts. \"Often women go out alongside their male counterparts and do female searching and engage with female civilians,\" Dr Bennett says.\n\nSupplied Dr Bennett and her comrades were inspected by Queen Elizabeth II at her commissioning parade in April 2006\n\nDr Bennett jokes about close shaves when mortars landed within metres of where she was sleeping in Iraq. \"I managed to avoid anything particularly catastrophic... although my laundry did get blown up one time,\" she says. \"When anyone has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, it will always leave some scars, it can sometimes be really difficult to talk about. \"When I left the military, I did feel quite isolated, I felt quite alone. I don't think anyone really understood my journey.\"\n\nBex Bennett Dr Bennett was deployed to southern Afghanistan in 2010\n\nDr Bennett believes female veterans often avoid traditional spaces, such as local Royal British Legion clubs, because of people's misconceptions about the military. \"Women can find it quite daunting,\" she says. \"Sometimes people presume that they haven't served, or they are the wife of someone who has served, and that can be off-putting.\" A spokesperson for the Royal British Legion says its clubs are open to everyone. \"As the country's largest military charity, we're proud to be at the heart of a national network that supports our whole Armed Forces community,\" they added.\n\nGemma Saunders, Dr Bennett and Mel Dyke meeting for coffee and a chat\n\nBut Dr Bennett says Sisters in Service provides \"cathartic\" support and connection that women can struggle to find after leaving the Armed Forces. \"It's about meeting people that have done similar things, trodden similar paths, and being able to discuss that, and laugh and joke about things that have been happening,\" Dr Bennett says. The women meet for meals or coffee, and dog walks in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. They also run online meetings for Sisters in Service members who live further afield, and they are looking at organising fitness activities and residential retreats.\n\nMrs Dyke shows a display of her cap badges and other Army memorabilia\n\nMel Dyke, who lives in Staffordshire, says the network is a \"vital community\" for women who leave the military. \"I found my transition quite difficult because I left when I had my eldest daughter,\" she says. \"One day I was in a supportive Army environment, then the next I was on maternity leave and became a civilian.\"\n\nMel Dyke Mrs Dyke was an Army engineer on this training exercise in Canada in 2006\n\nMrs Dyke laughs as she describes her deployment to Iraq as a clerk with the Royal Engineers. \"You often hear the term 'pen-pusher' as clerks out there, but particularly in Iraq I was used for female searches so I would go out on search patrols,\" she says. \"Going out in a vehicle as 'top cover', so standing on a vehicle with my rifle, providing cover for the driver.\"\n\nMel Dyke Mrs Dyke married her husband Chris five years after they met on active service in 2006\n\nMrs Dyke says the most difficult time came after she transferred to the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps, and treated battle casualties at the former national military rehabilitation centre Headley Court, in Surrey. \"I was having to look after friends as patients,\" she says. \"It was really personal because my husband was still out on operations in Afghanistan, but members of his regiment were coming back to Headley Court.\" One of those patients suffered a traumatic brain injury in an explosion that killed his comrade. They were both close friends of Mrs Dyke's husband, Chris. \"It was really difficult trying to live life as normal knowing what's going on in Afghanistan... it was emotionally draining, and I [was] also pregnant,\" Mrs Dyke adds.\n\nMiss Saunders founded Sisters in Service with Dr Bennett in May 2024\n\nGemma Saunders, a psychotherapist who also worked at Headley Court, co-founded Sisters in Service with Dr Bennett. Miss Saunders says women who leave the service may have \"scars\" that compound the challenges they face after moving into demanding healthcare roles. \"They are trained to not show any weakness,\" she says. \"They have to be as good as the men, their counterparts, if not better. \"When they leave service, that doesn't leave them, so sometimes it's much harder for them to reach out and access support. \"Women will carry on and keep going, to carry that mental load more than men. They can come across as a hard shell to crack. \"It's trying to break those barriers that it is OK to ask for help.\"\n\nSupplied Dr Bennett received an honorary degree for her work with female veterans\n\nDr Bennett was awarded an honorary master's degree by the University of Derby this summer, for supporting female veterans and for her mental health work. She recently spent six months working with HMP Nottingham inmates, which included male veterans with mental health conditions. But Dr Bennett says Sisters in Service needs to \"spread the word\" about women's front-line role in recent conflicts. \"You are seen, and your experiences matter. There is strength in community, and you are not alone,\" she adds.\n\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many women who served in the military, especially in front-line roles, feel overlooked and face difficulties after leaving the service. They often struggle to find support because people don’t always understand their experiences.\n\n**What happened** – Dr Bex Bennett and Gemma Saunders started Sisters in Service in May 2023. This group brings together women veterans across the UK to support each other through meetings, activities, and online events. It now has 160 members who share similar military backgrounds and current careers in healthcare.\n\n**Impact** – Sisters in Service helps women veterans feel less isolated by connecting them with others who understand their unique challenges. For example, some women find traditional veteran clubs intimidating or assume women didn’t serve in combat roles. The group offers a safe space to share stories, laugh, and support mental health after difficult deployments in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n**What's next step** – The group plans to expand activities by adding fitness events and retreats. They also want to raise more awareness about the important roles women played in recent conflicts and encourage more female veterans to join and seek support.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Sisters in Service is building a strong community that helps female veterans overcome isolation and find understanding after their military service.",
