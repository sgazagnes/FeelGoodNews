      "title": "Scientists found a way to cool quantum computers using noise",
      "summary": "Quantum computers need extreme cold to work, but the very systems that keep them cold also create noise that can destroy fragile quantum information. Scientists in Sweden have now flipped that problem on its head by building a tiny quantum refrigerator that actually uses noise to drive cooling instead of fighting it. By carefully steering heat at unimaginably small scales, the device can act as a refrigerator, heat engine, or energy amplifier inside quantum circuits.",
      "content": "Quantum computers only work when they are kept extremely cold. The problem is that today's cooling systems also create noise, which can interfere with the fragile quantum information they are supposed to protect. Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have now introduced a new type of minimal quantum \"refrigerator\" that turns this challenge into an advantage. Instead of fighting noise, the device partially relies on it to operate. The result is highly precise control over heat and energy flow, which could help make large scale quantum technology possible.\n\nQuantum technology is widely expected to reshape major areas of society. Potential applications include drug discovery, artificial intelligence, logistics optimization, and secure communications. Despite this promise, serious technical barriers still stand in the way of real world use. One of the most difficult challenges is maintaining and controlling the delicate quantum states that make these systems work.\n\nWhy Quantum Computers Must Be Near Absolute Zero\n\nQuantum computers built with superconducting circuits must be cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero (around -- 273 °C). At these temperatures, materials become superconducting, allowing electrons to move without resistance. Only under these extreme conditions can stable quantum states form inside qubits, the basic units of quantum information.\n\nThese quantum states are extremely sensitive. Small changes in temperature, electromagnetic interference, or background noise can quickly erase stored information. This sensitivity makes quantum systems difficult to operate and even harder to expand.\n\nAs researchers attempt to scale up quantum computers to solve practical problems, heat and noise become harder to control. Larger and more complex systems create more opportunities for unwanted energy to spread and disrupt fragile quantum states.\n\n\"Many quantum devices are ultimately limited by how energy is transported and dissipated. Understanding these pathways and being able to measure them allows us to design quantum devices in which heat flows are predictable, controllable and even useful,\" says Simon Sundelin, doctoral student of quantum technology at Chalmers University of Technology and the study's lead author.\n\nUsing Noise as a Cooling Tool\n\nIn a study published in Nature Communications, the Chalmers team describes a fundamentally different kind of quantum refrigerator. Instead of trying to eliminate noise, the system uses it as the driving force behind cooling.\n\n\"Physicists have long speculated about a phenomenon called Brownian refrigeration; the idea that random thermal fluctuations could be harnessed to produce a cooling effect. Our work represents the closest realisation of this concept to date,\" says Simone Gasparinetti, associate professor at Chalmers and senior author of the study.\n\nAt the core of the refrigerator is a superconducting artificial molecule created in Chalmers' nanofabrication laboratory. It behaves much like a natural molecule, but instead of atoms, it is built from tiny superconducting electrical circuits.\n\nThe artificial molecule is connected to multiple microwave channels. By adding carefully controlled microwave noise in the form of random signal fluctuations within a narrow frequency range, the researchers can guide how heat and energy move through the system with remarkable precision.\n\n\"The two microwave channels serve as hot and cold reservoirs, but the key point is that they are only effectively connected when we inject controlled noise through a third port. This injected noise enables and drives heat transport between the reservoirs via the artificial molecule. We were able to measure extremely small heat currents, down to powers in the order of attowatts, or 10-18 watt. If such a small heat flow were used to warm a drop of water, it would take the age of the universe to see its temperature rise one degree Celsius,\" explains Sundelin.\n\nNew Paths Toward Scalable Quantum Technology\n\nBy carefully adjusting reservoir temperatures and tracking minuscule heat flows, the quantum refrigerator can operate in multiple ways. Depending on conditions, it can function as a refrigerator, act as a heat engine, or amplify thermal transport.\n\nThis level of control is especially important in larger quantum systems, where heat is produced locally during qubit operation and measurement. Managing that heat directly inside quantum circuits could improve stability and performance in ways conventional cooling systems cannot.\n\n\"We see this as an important step towards controlling heat directly inside quantum circuits, at a scale that conventional cooling systems can't reach. Being able to remove or redirect heat at this tiny scale opens the door to more reliable and robust quantum technologies,\" says Aamir Ali, a researcher in quantum technology at Chalmers and co-author of the study.\n\nMore Information\n\nThe study Quantum refrigeration powered by noise in a superconducting circuit was published in the scientific journal Nature Communications. The authors are Simon Sundelin, Mohammed Ali Aamir, Vyom Manish Kulkarni, Claudia Castillo-Moreno, and Simone Gasparinetti from the Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience at Chalmers University of Technology.\n\nThe quantum refrigerator was fabricated at the Nanofabrication Laboratory, Myfab, at Chalmers University of Technology.\n\nFunding for the research was provided by the Swedish Research Council, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through the Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology (WACQT), the European Research Council, and the European Union.",

      "content": "Chemical synthesis is the process of creating complex chemical compounds from simpler precursors.Credit: Andrew Lambert Photography/SPL\n\nSearching for blockbuster drugs and wonder materials is an arduous task for chemists. To make their promising compounds, they must trawl through millions of known chemical reactions, with hundreds of thousands more added annually, and then test whether it is possible to synthesize them.\n\nNow, researchers have created an artificial-intelligence system that vastly simplifies and accelerates the process of chemical synthesis. The system, which is called MOSAIC and is described in a study published in Nature on 19 January1, recommended conditions that researchers were able to use to generate 35 compounds with the potential to become products like pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals or cosmetics without needing to do any further trawling or tweaking.\n\n“The synthesis of small molecules is the slow step in drug discovery and a number of other important areas,” says study co-author Timothy Newhouse, a chemist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nMOSAIC could remove this bottleneck, adds Newhouse, so could lead to more and better products. It is “capable of drafting complete laboratory instructions — detailed enough for chemists to follow — to help create molecules that have not previously existed”.\n\nAI-assisted chemistry\n\nPredicting the conditions of chemical reactions has been a key focus of AI use in chemistry. One of the most prominent tools is IBM’s RXN for Chemistry, which is based on a large language model (LLM).\n\nIt uses a system called simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES). This translates chemical 3D structures into letters, numbers and punctuation, which are better suited to a system that recognizes language. By contrast, LLMs such as ChemCrow are trained for chemistry tasks using natural-language data2.\n\nAI chatbot shows surprising talent for predicting chemical properties and reactions\n\nThe SMILES approach makes it easier to process chemical information such as starting materials and solvents. “Our goal was to build a general model that could read chemistry the way chemists write it [by] listening to the language of experimental procedures and quickly turning that collective voice into a practical suggestion,” says Newhouse. Newhouse adds that integrating the step-by-step instructions that MOSAIC produces into automated systems would be a “natural next step”.\n\nThe researchers used an AI system they had developed previously3 to cluster a database of around one million reactions extracted from patents into 2,285 subsets. Using the subsets, the team trained Meta’s partially open-source Llama LLM to create 2,498 separate expert models, each specialized in one combination of chemical transformation starting from one type of molecule. This approach can run on computers locally because it uses fewer parameters than do the major LLMs.\n\nMartin Seifrid, a materials scientist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, says that MOSAIC is notable in that it avoids “throwing the largest possible model at a problem, instead choosing to focus on a carefully designed system of much smaller ‘expert’ models”. “Each specialized model is more accurate within its domain,” Seifrid says.\n\nBottleneck opened",

Now researchers uploading their work to the site are facing a new requirement: from 11 February, all submissions must be either written in English or accompanied by a full English translation.\n\nUntil now, authors have had to submit only an abstract in English. Staff at arXiv say that the English rule will make life easier for its moderators and keep its readership broad. “We can’t be fair in judging papers if they are not in English,” says Ralph Wijers, the chair of the arXiv editorial advisory council and an astronomer at the University of Amsterdam, whose native language is Dutch. The site, based at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, does not undertake peer review, but a team of some 300 volunteer moderators verifies that submissions are “appropriate and topical”.\n\nScientists hide messages in papers to game AI peer review\n\nArXiv hosts nearly 3 million preprints across eight subject areas, although the vast majority of the manuscripts are in computer science, physics and mathematics. Just 1% of submissions are in a language other than English. Nonetheless, the revised language policy has prompted some vocal complaints, including arguments that the burden of the mandate might deter people from making content such as PhD theses and preprints of textbook chapters public. Authors of such texts might think it is not worth the effort to translate them or to find an alternative venue for making them accessible\n\n“I personally see it as a loss for our community,” says mathematician Angelo Lucia at the Polytechnic of Milan in Italy.\n\nSeveral French mathematicians posted on the arXiv announcement saying they might take their manuscripts to the French preprint server HAL (Hyper Articles en Ligne), instead. HAL hosts works in several languages including English, French and Spanish, without requiring translations.\n\nMachine translation\n\nThe arXiv policy specifies that automated translations, such as those done by artificial-intelligence chatbots, are acceptable, so long as they are faithful to the original work.\n\nEditors at arXiv have some reservations about these systems’ capabilities, however. “Our advice is: feel free to use an AI or an LLM [large language model] to translate your text, but please check it,” says Wijers. “Our own experience is that AI translation is good but not good enough.”\n\nThis caution echoes that expressed by respondents to a Nature survey in 2025 of more than 5,000 researchers from around the world (respondents included both volunteers and randomly selected authors of recent papers). Although more than 90% of those surveyed felt it was acceptable to use AI to translate a paper into another language (and 8% had done so), more than half said this would be appropriate only if the translation was checked by a native speaker.\n\nDelving deep\n\nLLMs are widely considered to be excellent at generating conversational text, but limited attention has been given to their prowess at translating scientific papers.\n\nJames Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University in California, and Hannah Kleidermacher, a doctoral student in electrical engineering also at Stanford, investigated one LLM’s ability to translate academic text from English into other languages. They asked GPT-4o — an LLM released by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, in 2024 — to create a 50-question multiple-choice quiz for each of six scientific papers in English across various topics, with an answer key. This produced an automated benchmark with which to evaluate the LLM’s performance. The authors then instructed the LLM to translate the six papers into 28 other languages, and take the quiz on the translated versions.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – arXiv is a popular website where scientists share their research papers before they are officially published. It hosts millions of papers in subjects like physics, math, and computer science. Until now, authors only needed to write their paper summaries in English.\n\n**What happened** – Starting February 11, 2026, arXiv will require all submitted papers to be either fully in English or include a complete English translation. This new rule aims to make it easier for moderators to check papers and for readers worldwide to understand the research. The site allows the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to translate papers, but asks authors to carefully review these translations.\n\n**Impact** – This change could encourage many researchers to use AI translators, like large language models, to convert their work into English. While some scientists worry this might make sharing certain documents harder, especially if translations are difficult or costly, the policy could help more people access research from around the world. AI tools can speed up translation but still need human checks to ensure accuracy.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers may increasingly rely on AI to translate their papers, and developers might improve these AI tools to handle scientific language better. Meanwhile, some authors might choose other platforms that accept multiple languages without translation. arXiv’s experience could influence how other research sites handle language rules in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – arXiv’s new English submission rule is pushing scientists to use AI translators, shaping how research is shared and understood globally.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – arXiv est un site populaire où les scientifiques partagent leurs articles avant publication officielle. Il contient des millions d’articles en physique, mathématiques et informatique. Jusqu’à présent, seuls les résumés devaient être en anglais.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – À partir du 11 février 2026, arXiv demandera que tous les articles soumis soient entièrement en anglais ou accompagnés d’une traduction complète en anglais. Cette règle vise à faciliter la vérification des articles par les modérateurs et à rendre la recherche accessible aux lecteurs du monde entier. Le site autorise l’usage d’outils d’intelligence artificielle (IA) pour la traduction, mais les auteurs doivent vérifier ces traductions.\n\n**Impact** – Ce changement pourrait encourager de nombreux chercheurs à utiliser des traducteurs IA, comme les grands modèles de langage, pour traduire leurs travaux en anglais. Certains craignent que cela complique la diffusion de certains documents, surtout si la traduction est difficile ou coûteuse, mais la règle pourrait aider plus de personnes à accéder à la recherche mondiale. Les outils IA accélèrent la traduction mais nécessitent encore une relecture humaine.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs pourraient de plus en plus s’appuyer sur l’IA pour traduire leurs articles, et les développeurs pourraient améliorer ces outils pour mieux gérer le langage scientifique. Certains auteurs pourraient aussi choisir d’autres plateformes acceptant plusieurs langues sans traduction. L’expérience d’arXiv pourrait influencer les règles linguistiques d’autres sites de recherche.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – La nouvelle règle d’arXiv pour les soumissions en anglais pousse les scientifiques à utiliser des traducteurs IA, transformant la diffusion de la recherche dans le monde.\n",
