      "title": "Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is spraying water across the solar system",
      "summary": "For millions of years, a frozen wanderer drifted between the stars before slipping into our solar system as 3I/ATLAS—only the third known interstellar comet ever spotted. When scientists turned NASA’s Swift Observatory toward it, they caught the first-ever hint of water from such an object, detected through a faint ultraviolet glow of hydroxyl gas. Even more surprising, the comet was blasting out water at a rate of about 40 kilograms per second while still far from the Sun—much farther than where most comets “switch on.”",
      "content": "For countless ages, a small chunk of ice and dust traveled alone through interstellar space, like a sealed bottle drifting across a vast cosmic sea.\n\nThis summer, that traveler entered our solar system and received the name 3I/ATLAS, becoming only the third confirmed interstellar comet ever observed. When researchers at Auburn University aimed NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory at the object, they uncovered something extraordinary: the first detection of hydroxyl (OH) gas coming from it, a clear chemical sign of water. Swift was able to detect a faint ultraviolet glow that ground based telescopes cannot see because it operates above Earth's atmosphere, where this type of light is not blocked before reaching the surface.\n\nFirst Detection of Water on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS\n\nIdentifying water through its ultraviolet byproduct, hydroxyl, marks an important step in understanding how interstellar comets behave and change over time. In comets that formed within our own solar system, water serves as the primary measure of activity. Scientists use it to determine how sunlight triggers the release of other gases and to compare the mix of frozen materials inside a comet's nucleus. Detecting the same water signature in 3I/ATLAS means astronomers can now evaluate it using the same standards applied to familiar solar system comets. That comparison opens the door to studying how planetary systems across the galaxy may differ or resemble our own.\n\nUnexpected Water Activity Far From the Sun\n\nWhat makes 3I/ATLAS especially intriguing is the distance at which this water activity was observed. Swift detected hydroxyl when the comet was nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth is, well beyond the region where surface ice would normally turn directly into vapor. Even at that distance, the comet was losing water at a rate of about 40 kilograms per second, comparable to water blasting from a fully opened fire hose. Most comets native to our solar system remain relatively inactive that far out.\n\nThe strong ultraviolet signal suggests that additional processes may be involved. One possibility is that sunlight is warming tiny icy particles that have broken away from the nucleus. As those grains heat up, they could release vapor and supply the surrounding cloud of gas. Only a small number of distant comets have shown this kind of extended water source, and it points to layered ices that may preserve information about how and where the object originally formed.\n\nClues to Planet Formation Beyond Our Solar System\n\nEach interstellar comet discovered so far has revealed something different about chemistry in other planetary systems. Together, these visitors show that the ingredients that build comets, especially volatile ices, can vary widely from one star system to another. Those differences provide insight into how temperature, radiation, and chemical makeup shape the materials that eventually form planets and possibly create conditions suitable for life.\n\nHow NASA's Swift Observatory Made the Discovery\n\nDetecting that faint ultraviolet signal was also a technical achievement. NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory carries a relatively small 30 centimeter telescope, yet from its position in orbit it can observe ultraviolet wavelengths that are mostly absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. Without interference from air and sky brightness, Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope can reach a sensitivity comparable to a 4 meter class ground telescope at those wavelengths. Its ability to respond quickly allowed the Auburn team to observe 3I/ATLAS within weeks of its discovery, before it became too faint or moved too close to the Sun for safe observation from space.\n\n\"When we detect water -- or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH -- from an interstellar comet, we're reading a note from another planetary system,\" said Dennis Bodewits, professor of physics at Auburn. \"It tells us that the ingredients for life's chemistry are not unique to our own.\"\n\n\"Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,\" added Zexi Xing, postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study. \"'Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn't expect it. Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.\"\n\n3I/ATLAS has since dimmed and is currently out of view, but it is expected to become observable again after mid November. That return will give scientists another opportunity to monitor how its activity changes as it moves closer to the Sun. The detection of hydroxyl, detailed in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, offers the first solid proof that this interstellar comet is releasing water far from the Sun. It also highlights how even a modest space based telescope, operating above Earth's atmosphere, can capture faint ultraviolet signals that connect this rare visitor to the broader family of comets and to the distant planetary systems where such objects are born.",

      "title": "Astronomers shocked by how these giant exoplanets formed",
      "summary": "A distant star system with four super-sized gas giants has revealed a surprise. Thanks to JWST’s powerful vision, astronomers detected sulfur in their atmospheres — a chemical clue that they formed like Jupiter, by slowly building solid cores. That’s unexpected because these planets are far bigger and orbit much farther from their star than models once allowed.",
      "content": "Gas giants are enormous planets made primarily of hydrogen and helium. They may contain dense central cores, but unlike Earth, they do not have solid surfaces you could stand on. In our solar system, Jupiter and Saturn are classic examples. Beyond our neighborhood, astronomers have identified many gas giant exoplanets, some far larger than Jupiter. The most massive of these worlds begin to resemble brown dwarfs, substellar objects sometimes called \"failed stars\" because they do not fuse hydrogen.\n\nThis overlap raises a major question in astronomy. How exactly do these massive planets form? One possibility is core accretion, the same process believed to have created Jupiter and Saturn. In this scenario, a solid core slowly builds up inside a disk of dust and ice, gathering rocky and icy material until it becomes massive enough to pull in surrounding gas. Another possibility is gravitational instability, where a swirling cloud of gas around a young star collapses quickly under its own gravity, forming a large object more like a brown dwarf.\n\nA research team led by the University of California San Diego set out to investigate this mystery using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). By studying the HR 8799 star system, they uncovered evidence that offers a surprising answer. Their findings were published in Nature Astronomy.\n\nThe HR 8799 System and Its Super Jupiters\n\nHR 8799 lies about 133 light years away in the constellation Pegasus. It hosts four massive planets, each between five and ten times the mass of Jupiter. These worlds orbit at distances ranging from 15 to 70 astronomical units, meaning even the closest planet is 15 times farther from its star than Earth is from the sun. The planet masses range from 5−10 MJup, so even the smallest of them outweighs Jupiter by a factor of five.\n\nIn some ways, HR 8799 resembles a scaled-up version of our solar system, which also features four outer giant planets stretching from Jupiter to Neptune. However, the sheer size of the HR 8799 planets and their wide orbits puzzled scientists. Earlier models based on our solar system suggested that planets forming through core accretion would not have enough time to grow so massive before the young star dispersed the surrounding disk of gas.\n\nJWST Spectroscopy Reveals Sulfur Clues\n\nTo dig deeper, astronomers used spectroscopy, a technique that analyzes light to reveal the chemical makeup and physical properties of distant planets. Before JWST, researchers relied on ground-based telescopes to measure molecules such as water and carbon monoxide in exoplanet atmospheres. Over time, scientists realized that carbon and oxygen-based molecules are not ideal for tracing how planets form because their origins are difficult to pinpoint.\n\nInstead, the team focused on more stable materials known as refractory elements. These elements, including sulfur, exist in solid form within the protoplanetary disk where planets take shape. Detecting sulfur in a gas giant atmosphere points strongly toward formation through core accretion.\n\n\"With its unprecedented sensitivity, JWST is enabling the most detailed study of the atmospheres of these planets, giving us clues to their formation pathways. With the detection of sulfur, we are able to infer that the HR 8799 planets likely formed in a similar way to Jupiter despite being five to ten times more massive, which was unexpected,\" stated Jean-Baptiste Ruffio, a research scientist at UC San Diego and first co-author of the paper.\n\nHR 8799 is relatively young at around 30 million years old (for reference, our solar system is about 4.6 billion years old). Younger planets still retain heat from their formation, making them brighter and easier to analyze with spectroscopy.\n\nJWST's high resolution spectrograph allows scientists to examine exoplanet light without interference from molecules in Earth's atmosphere. For the first time, astronomers detected detailed signatures of several rare molecules in the atmospheres of the system's three inner gas giants that had previously gone unseen.\n\nDetecting Hydrogen Sulfide on Distant Worlds\n\nExtracting this information was challenging. The planets are roughly 10,000 times fainter than their host star, and JWST was not originally optimized for such extreme contrasts. Ruffio developed new data analysis techniques to isolate the planets' faint signals. Jerry Xuan, a 51 Pegasi b Fellow at UCLA, built sophisticated atmospheric models to compare with the telescope's spectra and determine whether sulfur was present.\n\n\"The quality of the JWST data is truly revolutionary and existing atmospheric model grids were simply not adequate. To fully capture what the data were telling us, I iteratively refined the chemistry and physics in the models,\" he said. \"In the end, we detected several molecules in these planets -- some for the first time, including hydrogen sulfide.\"\n\nClear signs of sulfur were found on the third planet, HR 8799 c, and the researchers believe it likely exists on the other two inner planets as well. The team also discovered that these planets contain higher amounts of heavy elements such as carbon and oxygen compared to their star, additional evidence that they formed as planets rather than as brown dwarf-like objects.\n\nRethinking Planet Formation Models\n\n\"There are many models of planet formation to consider. I think this shows that older core accretion models are outdated,\" stated UC San Diego Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Quinn Konopacky, another co-author of the paper. \"And of the newer models, we are looking at ones where gas giants can form solid cores really far away from their star.\"\n\nSo far, HR 8799 remains the only directly imaged system known to contain four massive gas giants. However, other systems have been found with one or two even larger companions whose origins remain uncertain.\n\n\"I think the question is, how big can a planet be?\" Ruffio stated. \"Can a planet be 15, 20, 30 times the mass of Jupiter and still have formed like a planet? Where is the transition between planet formation and brown dwarf formation?\"\n\nResearchers continue to explore these questions, studying one star system at a time.\n\nPartial list of authors: Jean-Baptiste Ruffio, Eve J. Lee and Quinn Konopacky (all UC San Diego); Jerry W. Xuan (California Institute of Technology and UCLA); Dimitri Mawet, Aurora Kesseli, Charles Beichman, Geoffrey Bryden and Thomas P.

It is designed to support the integration, testing, and checkouts of the rocket and spacecraft, in addition to serving as the structural platform, or as Berdis calls it, “the shoulders, at liftoff.” Standing more than 400 feet tall, the mobile launcher houses the umbilicals that provide power, communications, coolant, fuel, and stabilization prior to launch, as well as access for the Artemis II crew to safely board Orion.\n\nWhen Berdis first arrived on center, the sight of massive ground systems left an unforgettable impression. To him, these weren’t just structures, they were skyscrapers for space exploration.\n\nJesse Berdis, Artemis II mobile launcher 1 deputy project manager, poses for a photo near the emergency egress system at Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday, Feb. 6, 2026.
