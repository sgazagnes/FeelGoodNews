      "title": "Scientists grow mini human livers that predict toxic drug reactions",
      "summary": "A new human liver organoid microarray developed by Cincinnati Children’s and Roche recreates immune-driven liver injury in the lab. Built from patient-derived stem cells and immune cells, it accurately models how genetics influence drug reactions. The system replicated flucloxacillin-related toxicity seen only in people with a specific genetic variant, marking a major step toward predictive, patient-tailored drug safety testing.",
      "content": "Researchers at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, working in partnership with Roche, have created a next-generation human liver organoid microarray platform designed to predict which medications might trigger harmful immune responses in certain individuals.\n\nThe findings, published online on Sept. 26, 2025, in Advanced Science, describe a fully human, miniaturized liver system developed from stem cells and a patient's own immune cells. This advanced model provides a new way to study why some people suffer severe immune-related liver injuries from drugs that are otherwise considered safe. Co-first author Fadoua El Abdellaoui Soussi, PhD, and corresponding author Magdalena Kasendra, PhD, both from the Center for Stem Cell and Organoid Medicine (CuSTOM) at Cincinnati Children's, led the research.\n\n\"Our goal was to create a human system that captures how the liver and immune system interact in patients,\" El Abdellaoui Soussi says. \"By integrating patient-specific genetics and immune responses, we can finally begin to explain why certain drugs cause liver injury in only a small subset of individuals.\"\n\nA model that replicates immune-related liver injury\n\nCertain drugs that pass traditional safety testing can still trigger idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (iDILI), a rare but serious immune reaction that can cause severe illness or force a drug to be withdrawn. Standard laboratory and animal models have long struggled to reproduce these complex immune responses that vary from person to person.\n\nThe new platform closes this gap by combining liver organoids made from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with each donor's own CD8⁺ T cells, which are immune cells that target infected or damaged tissue. The result is a fully human, immune-competent system that reflects both the genetic and immune diversity found in real patients.\n\nAs proof of concept, the researchers recreated the liver damage caused by the antibiotic flucloxacillin, which occurs only in individuals who carry the HLA-B*57:01 risk gene. Their model accurately reproduced the biological signs of immune-related liver injury, including T cell activation, cytokine release, and liver cell damage, closely mirroring what happens in susceptible people.\n\n\"Our goal has always been to bring human biology into the lab in a way that's scalable, reproducible, and meaningful for patients,\" says Kasendra, who serves as director of research and development at CuSTOM. \"By linking foundational stem cell science with applied toxicology, this model moves organoid research another step closer to transforming how drugs are developed and tested.\"\n\nBuilding on a foundation of organoid innovation\n\nThis new platform expands on previous work by co-author Takanori Takebe, MD, PhD, whose lab developed methods for reliably generating human liver organoids from iPSCs. By refining these techniques into a matrix-free microarray system and pairing them with patient-specific immune cells, the CuSTOM Accelerator team at Cincinnati Children's turned a scientific breakthrough into a scalable precision toxicology tool.\n\nThe collaboration with Roche played a key role in the project's success, combining the hospital's scientific expertise with Roche's experience in translational toxicology.\n\n\"This partnership shows the power of combining academic innovation with industry experience,\" says Adrian Roth, PhD, principal scientific director of Personalized Healthcare Safety at Roche. \"Together we're building predictive human models that can improve patient safety and accelerate the development of new medicines.\"\n\nA growing ecosystem for organoid medicine\n\nCincinnati Children's has been a global leader in organoid medicine since 2010, when its scientists created the first functional human intestinal organoids.\n\nUnder Kasendra's leadership, the CuSTOM Accelerator partners with biopharma and technology companies to translate these scientific advances into real-world solutions for drug safety, precision medicine, and regenerative therapy.\n\nWhat's next\n\nThe CuSTOM Accelerator team continues working to automate organoid assays and enable high-throughput screening across large, genetically diverse donor populations. This next phase will allow researchers to capture the full spectrum of human variability -- an essential step toward developing therapies that are more effective, inclusive, and personalized.\n\nLearn more about CuSTOM's ongoing collaboration with Molecular Devices and Danaher: Collaboration to Develop Liver Organoids for Drug Toxicity Screening -- Research Horizons\n\n\"This work reflects the vision of CuSTOM -- to turn human organoid science into practical tools that improve health,\" Kasendra says, \"This is just the beginning -- by bridging biology, engineering, and clinical insight, we're getting closer to predicting how real patients will respond to new treatments before they ever reach the clinic.\"\n\nAbout the study\n\nCincinnati Children's and University of Cincinnati co-authors included co-first author Michael Brusilovsky, PhD, (now with Sanofi), Emma Buck, MS, (now at Imanis Life Sciences), W. Clark Bacon, MS, Sina Dadgar, PhD, Riccardo Barrile, PhD, and Michael Helmrath, MD. Collaborators also included experts from Genentech, Inc., and Molecular Devices LLC.\n\nFunding sources for this research include Roche, Danaher, and the Farmer Family Foundation.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Some medicines can cause serious liver damage in a few people because of their unique immune responses. Traditional lab tests and animal studies often cannot predict these rare reactions, making it hard to know which drugs are safe for everyone.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, working with Roche, created a tiny human liver system called an organoid. This mini liver is made from patient stem cells and their own immune cells. It can mimic how a person’s liver and immune system work together. Using this system, they successfully recreated the liver damage caused by the antibiotic flucloxacillin in people who have a specific gene, showing the model can predict who might get sick from certain drugs.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it offers a new way to test drug safety using real human biology instead of animals or simple lab tests. It helps explain why some people react badly to drugs while others don’t. This method can make drug testing more precise and personalized, potentially preventing harmful side effects before drugs are given to patients.\n\n**What’s next step** – The team plans to improve this technology to test many drugs quickly using samples from lots of different people. This will help capture the wide variety of human genetics and immune responses. Their goal is to create better, safer medicines tailored to each person’s biology.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have built tiny human livers in the lab that can predict dangerous immune reactions to drugs based on a person’s genes, improving drug safety testing.\n\n",

EMR access is both retrospective and prospective, allowing longitudinal studies. Genetic profiling is done with population-optimized SNP arrays for those of Han Chinese ancestry that enable genome-wide association 3,4, phenome-wide association 5,6, and polygenic risk score 7,8 studies to evaluate common disease risk and pharmacogenetic response. Participants also agree to be recontacted for future research and receive personalized genetic risk profiles with health management recommendations. TPMI has established the TPMI Data Access Platform (TDAP), a central database and analysis platform that both safeguards the security of the data and facilitates academic research. As a large non-European ancestry cohort that merges genetic profiles with EMR and enables longitudinal follow-up, TPMI provides a unique resource to validate genetic risk prediction models, conduct clinical trials of risk-based health management, and inform health policies.

      "content": "Phylogenetic tree construction\n\nAll available A(H5) HA nucleotide sequences and accompanying metadata were downloaded from the GISAID Data Science Initiative60 and the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC)61 databases on 5 May 2023. The HA sequences of three antigens present in-house (A/Vietnam/3218/2004, A/duck/Hong-Kong/1091/2011 and A/eurasian-wigeon/Netherlands/EMC-3/2014), which were not yet available through the above mentioned databases at the time, were added to the dataset manually and deposited to GISAID in hindsight. The dataset was then preprocessed using Pépinière (a Python (v.3.10.14) jupyter notebook available at GitHub (https://github.com/epiv-lab/pepiniere) and Zenodo62). This included deduplication of sequences present in both datasets based on identical accession numbers, identification and extraction of the open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to the longest ORF, and removal of sequences (1) without metadata or (2) shorter than 90% of the mean ORF length. Identical sequences were then grouped, and only the earliest (by isolation date) representative was retained. After preprocessing, sequences were aligned using MAFFT (v.7.515)63, and the alignment was trimmed to the start and stop codons of the majority of sequences. Trimmed sequences were again filtered to remove identical sequences (retaining the earliest). The resulting dataset contained 14,896 sequences (Supplementary Table 1) and was realigned using MAFFT v.7.515 and maximum-likelihood trees were generated using IQ-Tree2 (v.2.1.4_beta)64 with the GTR + F + R10 model (chosen by ModelFinder65, implemented in IQ-Tree2) and 10,000 UFboot bootstrap approximations66. Trees were midpoint-rooted, annotated, and visualized using iTOL67. The display item was generated using ggtree (v.1.4.11)68 in R (v.4.4.3). Genetic clades were predicted using LABEL69 with the H5v2023 pre-release 1 (2023-05-05) module, courtesy of S. Shepard, and this prediction was used to annotate the tree.\n\nCells\n\nCells were maintained as described previously24. 293T cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1× non-essential amino acids (Lonza), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 2 mM l-glutamine (Lonza), 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin (Lonza) and 0.5 mg ml−1 geneticin (Invitrogen). Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC) were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (EMEM) (Lonza), supplemented with 10% FCS, 1× non-essential amino acids (Lonza), 1.5 mg ml−1 sodium bicarbonate (Lonza), 10 mM HEPES (Lonza), 2 mM l-glutamine (Lonza), 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin (Lonza). Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , and passaged twice weekly. Cells were not authenticated. All cell banks were tested negative for mycoplasma.\n\nGeneration of plasmids\n\nTo generate plasmids for recombinant virus production, viral RNA was isolated from in-house available virus isolate stocks using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was then used to generate viral copy DNA (cDNA) using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions; from the cDNA, individual HA or NA gene segments were amplified using segment-specific PCR (polymerase chain reaction) primers70 and the PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Individual viral gene segments were cloned into a previously described modified pHW2000 plasmid71 by restriction-site-based cloning or seamless cloning using the GeneArt Seamless Cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). If the respective virus isolate was not present in-house, synthetic genes containing HA sequences with a monobasic cleavage site were synthesized by BaseClear or Integrated DNA Technologies. When applicable, specific mutations were introduced in the HA genes and /or the HA multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) was removed by site-directed mutagenesis using the PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Agilent) and specific primers. Throughout the Article, A(H5) numbering is used to refer to specific amino acid positions72. To produce reverse genetics plasmids for A(H5N6) A/Sichuan/26221/2014 (Sichuan, accession number: EPI_ISL_163493), all eight gene segments were amplified from cDNA by PCR using specific primers70 and cloned into our bidirectional reverse genetics plasmid. To produce reverse genetics plasmids for A(H5N1) A/duck/Giza/15292S/2015 (Giza, accession number: EPI_ISL_257168), viral RNA was extracted, and all eight gene segments were amplified from cDNA by PCR using specific primers70 and cloned into our bidirectional reverse genetics plasmid. Non-coding regions, which are not part of the abovementioned sequences, were sequenced after RNA circularization as described previously73. The non-coding regions used are listed in Supplementary Table 11.\n\nBenefit sharing of synthetic constructs and viruses\n\nBefore the start of this work, we discussed and publicly announced our plans to generate synthetic HA constructs and produce recombinant A(H5) viruses and A(H5)-specific ferret sera through the GISAID website (https://gisaid.org/collaborations/collaboration-on-h5-antigenic-cartography/). Specifically, we made the commitment that the synthetic HA constructs, reverse genetics viruses and ferret sera will be shared with the laboratories that contributed the genome sequence data to GISAID60. We committed to publish the antigenic maps with open access to the public. We also indicated that reagents may be provided to other researchers, including National Influenza Centers and global reference laboratories, after assurance that the originating laboratory, where the clinical specimen or virus isolate was first obtained, and the submitting laboratory, where sequence data have been generated and submitted through the GISAID Data Science Initiative, are fully recognized, to ensure fair attribution of contributions to the results benefitting from the data. We are indebted to GISAID and all scientists contributing to the GISAID Data Science Initiative, without whom this work would not have been possible. We thank the governments and scientists of Austria, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Germany, Ghana, Indonesia, India, Iraq, Japan, Nepal, Nigeria, Mongolia, Russia, Scotland, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, United States and Vietnam for their contributions that made this research possible.\n\nBiosafety\n\nAll experiments were reviewed by the Erasmus MC Institution Review Entity (IRE), in accordance with the US Government September 2014 Dual-Use of Research of Concern (DURC) policy. The Erasmus MC IRE concluded that the studies described here were not falling under any of the seven DURC categories. Recombinant viruses that contained the HA (without MBCS) and/or NA of interest in the background of the attenuated vaccine strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR/8) or the high-yield version thereof (PR/8 HY, 76) (Supplementary Table 2) were handled under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions in agreement with national regulations. HPAIV wild-type isolates used in HI assays (Supplementary Table 2) were handled under BSL3 conditions. For the ferret challenge experiments, H5N6 Sichuan and H5N1 Giza recombinant viruses, which contained all eight wild-type gene segments of a single virus, were produced. These experiments were performed in the enhanced animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3+) facility of the Erasmus University Medical Center as described previously74.\n\nRecombinant virus production\n\nRecombinant influenza viruses were generated by reverse genetics using eight bidirectional plasmids as described previously24,71. One day before transfection, about 3 × 106 293T cells were seeded in gelatin-coated 10 cm culture dishes. Calcium-phosphate-mediated transfection was used to deliver a total of 40 μg of plasmid DNA per dish. About 16 h after transfection, the cells were washed once with PBS and fresh medium containing 2% FCS with 200–350 μg ml−1 N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Virus stocks were generated by inoculating either MDCK cells or 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs with dilutions of the supernatant collected from the 293T cells 3 days after transfection or virus isolates. Virus stock production in MDCK cells was performed using EMEM medium containing the same supplements as described above, but without FCS and with the addition of 20–35 μg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin, referred to as infection medium. MDCK supernatants or embryonated egg allantoic fluids were collected 2–3 d.p.i. and centrifuged at 2,100g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. The presence of virus was confirmed by haemagglutination assays using 1% turkey red blood cells (TRBCs, from in-house turkeys) in PBS. Sequences from all plasmids and from the non-PR/8 and PR/8 HY genes, that is, HA and NA of interest, of all virus stocks were confirmed with Sanger sequencing using the BigDye Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) and the 3500xL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).\n\nVirus titrations\n\nVirus titrations were performed in MDCK cells as described previously74. In brief, flat-bottom 96-well plates containing confluent MDCK cells were inoculated with tenfold serial dilutions of the samples and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C under 5% CO 2 . Cells were washed once with PBS and 200 μl of infection medium was added to each well. After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , the presence of virus in the supernatants was determined using HA assays to determine the TCID 50 . Virus titrations of the virus stocks were performed in ten replicates, and those of respiratory swabs and tissue homogenates from the vaccination-challenge experiments in four replicates. Virus titres were read out blindly.\n\nVaccine production\n\nVaccines were produced with recombinant viruses containing a mutated or wild-type HA, without MBCS, in the PR/8 HY background. For the initial screen of CVAs, whole-inactivated vaccines were generated with the corresponding matched NA. For the vaccination-challenge experiment, split-inactivated vaccines were used. To isolate the effect of varying the HA antigen in these studies, the NA present in the split-inactivated vaccines was mismatched with that of the challenge virus. Specifically, the vaccines in the H5N1 Giza challenge contained the N6 NA of H5N6 Sichuan , and the vaccines in the H5N6 Sichuan challenge contained the N1 NA of H5N1 Giza .\n\nWhole-inactivated and split-inactivated vaccines were generated as described previously52. Eleven-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with the virus of interest. Allantoic fluid was collected 2 d.p.i. and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,100g to remove cellular debris. Subsequent centrifugation steps were performed at 124,000g (SW 32 Ti, Beckman Coulter) at 4 °C, unless indicated otherwise. The allantoic fluid was concentrated on a 60% sucrose cushion by centrifuging for 2 h. Subsequently, resuspended sucrose cushions from multiple tubes were pooled and loaded onto 60/50/40/30/20% sucrose gradients, and centrifuged overnight at the lowest deceleration setting. The virus band, located on top of the 30% sucrose layer, was collected, diluted in PBS and subsequently pelleted by centrifugation for 2 h to remove the sucrose. The pellet was dissolved in either PBS (whole-inactivated vaccines) or PBS with 2% N-decanoyl-N-methylglucamine (Mega10, Sigma-Aldrich) (split-inactivated vaccines) to solubilize the viral membrane proteins. Incubation with PBS with 2% Mega10 was performed for 1 h at 37 °C. For both whole- and split-inactivated vaccines, the dissolved pellets were transferred to dialysis chambers (Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassettes, 10 K MWCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently submerged in PBS containing 0.01% formalin for 3 days. Subsequently, the dialysis chambers were immerged in PBS for a day, during which the PBS was refreshed twice. The resulting vaccines were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Vaccine inactivation was confirmed by two serial blind passages on MDCK cells and/or in embryonated chicken eggs.\n\nTotal protein content was determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid total protein analysis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the whole-inactivated vaccines, the absolute and relative HA content was estimated from SDS–PAGE protein gels using a BSA standard and stained with Instant Blue (Expedeon). The absolute HA content of the split-inactivated vaccines was estimated from SDS–PAGE using a BSA standard and stained with Instant Blue (Expedeon). The relative HA content of split-inactivated vaccines was determined with mass spectrometry, using a protocol based on a previous study75 with modifications as described previously52. Diluted vaccines (10 μl of 125 μg ml−1 of total protein) were mixed 1:1 with 0.2% RapiGest (Waters) and denatured for 5 min at 100 °C. After cooling to room temperature, 5 μl of sequence-grade modified trypsin solution (0.4 μg μl−1; Promega) was added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Digests were allowed to cool, and 55 μl of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid was added. The samples were subsequently analysed by a nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC) Ultimate 3000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nData from initial screens were used to select three peptides for stable isotope (SI) labelling (LVLATGLR, VNSIIDK and TLDFHDSNVK), based on intensity, length, sequence and sequence conservation within the A(H5) HA subtype. Digested vaccines were spiked with SI-labelled peptides with heavy lysine or arginine (Pepscan) at a final concentration of 50 fmol μl−1, and measured on the nano-LC system (Ultimate 3000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) combined with an Orbitrap Fusion Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each peptide, the ratio between the SI-labelled peptide and the endogenous peptide was calculated, and was subsequently used to determine the concentrations of the endogenous peptide in the vaccines. The HA concentration based on the three individual peptides was averaged for each vaccine, and subsequently used to determine the relative HA content of the vaccines.\n\nFerret experiments\n\nFerret (Mustela putorius furo) experiments were performed in strict compliance with the Dutch legislation on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (2014, European Union directive 2010/63/EU implemented). Experiments were performed at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands under a project license accredited by the Dutch competent authority (license number AVD101002015340). Study protocols were approved by the Erasmus Medical Center Animal Welfare Body (permit numbers 15-340-01, -04, -06, -22, -23 and -24). Ferrets were seronegative for Aleutian disease, seasonal influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B viruses. For all ferret experiments, animals were randomly allocated to the different groups. Ferret experiments were not performed blindly because regulations required knowledge of the animal treatment for biosafety reasons.\n\nSerum production\n\nFerret sera were generated as described previously24,25 in class III isolators under BLS3 conditions using recombinant viruses unless indicated otherwise (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Recombinant viruses were produced carrying the HA (without MBCS) and the closest matching NA present in-house, in the background of PR/8 or PR/8 HY. In brief, male ferrets (at least six months old) were inoculated intranasally by applying dropwise 250 μl of virus stock per nostril. Unless indicated otherwise (Supplementary Table 2), a boost was administered after 14 days, by subcutaneously injecting a total of 250 μl concentrated virus combined with 250 μl TiterMax Gold adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) at two different spots in the back.\n\nThe concentrated virus used for the subcutaneous boost was prepared by inoculating five 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs per virus. The allantoic fluid was collected 2 d.p.i. and cleared from debris by centrifuging for 10 min at 2,100g. About 36 ml of the cleared allantoic fluid was concentrated by centrifuging for 2 h at 124,000g (SW 32 Ti, Beckman Coulter), and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 700 μl PBS. Ferrets were terminally bled through cardiac puncture 14 days after the subcutaneous boost, or 14 days after the intranasal inoculation if no boost injection was performed. Before virus inoculation, subcutaneous boost injection and the terminal bleed, ferrets were anaesthetized with ketamine and medetomidine (10 and 0.05 mg per kg body weight, respectively), the latter which was antagonized with atipamezole (0.25 mg per kg body weight).\n\nThe blood samples were collected in VACUETTE CAT Serum Separator Clot Activator tubes (Greiner Bio-One), incubated at least for 15 min to allow clotting, and centrifuged for 15 min at 2,000g to obtain the serum.\n\nVaccination–challenge studies\n\nVaccination experiments were performed similarly as described previously52. Six- to 12-month-old female ferrets were used for vaccination studies (n = 2 for vaccination-only experiments and n = 6 for vaccination–challenge experiments). Ferrets were vaccinated twice intramuscularly on day 0 (prime) and day 28 (boost) with 250 μl of whole or split-inactivated vaccine estimated to contain about 7.5 μg HA, adjuvanted with 250 μl AddaVax (InvivoGen), which was equally divided between the two hind legs. For the mock-vaccinated groups, animals were vaccinated with 250 μl of PBS adjuvanted with 250 μl AddaVax. Before each vaccination, a blood sample was obtained through the cranial vena cava and serum was obtained as described above (pre- and pre-boost sera). The pre-sera were tested in HI assays as described below against seasonal influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B viruses (using vaccine strains of the respective year), as well as PR/8 recombinant viruses carrying A(H5) HAs from the respective vaccines and challenge virus, if applicable. Pre-sera were negative in HI assays against the tested viruses. The pre-boost sera of the ferrets from the challenge experiments were titrated in HI assays against PR/8 recombinant viruses with three vaccine antigens employed in the respective study.\n\nFor vaccination-only experiments, ferrets were euthanized 28 days after the boost vaccination through a cardiac puncture, and post-boost sera were obtained from the whole blood as described above.\n\nFor vaccination–challenge experiments, DST micro-T temperature loggers (Star-Oddi) were surgically implanted into the abdominal cavity of the ferrets 14 days after the prime vaccination. Serum samples were collected from whole blood sampled through the cranial vena cava 1 week before inoculation (post-boost sera) (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Vaccinated ferrets were then transferred to class III isolators for acclimatization a week before inoculation with the challenge virus. Ferrets were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally with wild-type recombinant viruses containing all eight segments of the respective challenge virus. The inoculation doses were 105.5 and 103.4 TCID 50 per animal for the H5N1 Giza and H5N6 Sichuan virus, respectively, divided over 3 ml intratracheally and 250 μl in each nostril. These doses were determined before the challenge in a pilot experiment using three ferrets per tested dose. The doses were selected to induce a reproducible and consistent infection of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Subsequently, daily nose and throat swabs were collected under light ketamine anaesthesia, and body weight and activity level score were monitored daily as described previously74,76. Body temperature was recorded every 10 min by the implanted temperature loggers. Then, at 4 d.p.i., ferrets were euthanized through cardiac puncture, after which tissues (selected based on virus detection in the pilot studies) were collected for virological and pathological analysis as described previously74. For virological analysis, the right nasal turbinates, trachea, right bronchus, right lung lobes, tracheobronchial lymph node and liver (for both challenges), right cerebrum and right cerebellum (for the H5N1 Giza challenge only), and the spleen (for the H5N6 Sichuan challenge only) were collected. For pathological examination, the left nasal turbinates, trachea, left bronchus and left lung lobes were collected.\n\nDuring blood collection, vaccination, virus inoculation and cardiac puncture, ferrets were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and medetomidine, and antagonized with atipamezole, as described above.\n\nHistopathology and IHC\n\nAfter necropsy, tissues were stored in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (lungs after careful inflation with formalin) for at least 2 weeks, after which the tissues were embedded in paraffin. Slides (4 μm) were made, and subsequent slides were either stained with haematoxylin and eosin or used for IHC as described previously77. In brief, after deparaffinization, antigen retrieval and blocking of endogenous proteases, slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either a primary antibody against influenza A virus nucleoprotein (Hb65, American Type Culture Collection, H16-L10-4R5) or a mouse IgG2a isotype control (R&D, MAB003), diluted in PBS with 0.1% BSA (1:400 and 1:200, respectively). After three washes with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20, the slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a goat anti-mouse IgG2a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Bio-Rad, Star133A), diluted 1:100 in PBS with 0.1% BSA. HRP was revealed using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole and a haematoxylin counterstain was performed. A lung section from an animal experimentally infected with 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) virus was used as positive control in each staining experiment.\n\nThe pathological changes and the presence of viral antigen in respiratory tissues were blindly scored in a semi-quantitative manner by a veterinary pathologist. Semi-quantitative assessment of influenza virus-associated inflammation in the lungs (four slides with longitudinal section and cross-section of cranial and caudal lobes per animal) was performed in a blinded manner on every slide as reported earlier78. The extent of alveolitis and alveolar damage was scored as follows: 0, 0%; 1, 1–25%; 2, 25–50%; 3, >50%. The severity of alveolitis, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, bronchial adenitis, tracheitis and rhinitis were scored as follows: 0, no inflammatory cells; 1, few inflammatory cells; 2, moderate numbers of inflammatory cells; 3, many inflammatory cells. The presence of alveolar oedema, alveolar haemorrhage and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia were scored as follows: 0, no; 1, yes. Finally, the extent of peribronchial, peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltrates were scored as follows: 0, none; 1, one to two cells thick; 2, three to ten cells thick; 3, more than ten cells thick. Semi-quantitative assessment of influenza virus antigen expression in the lungs was performed as reported earlier79. For the alveoli, 25 arbitrarily chosen fields of lung parenchyma of the 4 lung sections per animal were blindly examined by light microscopy, using a ×20 objective, for the presence of influenza virus nucleoprotein. The cumulative scores for each animal were presented as a percentage corresponding to the number of positive fields. The percentage of positive epithelium in the bronchi and bronchioles was estimated on all four lung slides and averaged per animal. The percentage of positively staining epithelium in the nose and trachea was estimated for one slide.\n\nSerological assays\n\nHI assays were performed with recombinant viruses in PR/8 or PR/8 HY background and virus isolates (Supplementary Table 2) as described previously24 using in-house TRBCs. Sera were treated overnight at 37 °C with five volumes of a Vibrio cholerae filtrate (generated in-house) containing receptor-destroying enzyme, to prevent aspecific inhibition. After inactivation for 1 h at 56 °C, sera were adsorbed using an equal volume of 10% TRBCs for 1 h at 4 °C to prevent aspecific agglutination. Twofold serial dilutions of sera in PBS were prepared in round-bottom 96-wells plates starting at 1:20 in a volume of 50 μl. To each well, 25 μl of virus, diluted in PBS to 4 hemagglutinating units, was added. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, 25 μl of 1% TRBCs was added to each well. Plates were subsequently incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before reading the HI titre. The HI titre was determined as the reciprocal value of the highest serum dilution which completely inhibited TRBC agglutination. HI titres were read out blindly. For the calculation of GMTs, threshold titres of <10 were converted to 5 unless stated otherwise.\n\nVirus neutralization assays were performed in MDCK cells as described previously24,32. First, sera were incubated for 30 min at 56 °C to inactivate complement. Twofold serial dilutions of sera in PBS, starting at 1:10, were combined with 100 TCID 50 of virus, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the virus–serum mixtures were added to flat-bottom 96-wells plates containing confluent MDCK cells previously washed once with PBS. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 , cells were washed once with PBS, and 200 μl infection medium per well was added. The plates were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO 2 , and the presence or absence of virus in the supernatants was determined after 3 days using HA assays with TRBCs. The virus neutralization titre was determined as the reciprocal value of the highest serum dilution for which no virus in the supernatants was detected. Virus neutralization titres were read out blindly. Virus neutralization assays were performed in duplicate, and the arithmetic means of log 2 titres were calculated.\n\nAntigenic cartography and antibody profiles\n\nAntigenic maps were constructed from HI data using a multidimensional scaling algorithm as described previously16 using the R package Racmacs (v.1.2.3)80. First, HI titres are converted to a distance matrix (HI table distances) by (1) dividing each HI titre by 10 and applying a log 2 transformation (hereafter, log 2 -transformed HI titres); and (2) subtracting each log 2 -transformed titre to the highest one for each serum. Secondly, multidimensional scaling algorithms are used to find the best set of map coordinates to represent the distances from the distance matrix most closely. For each optimization, antigens and sera, hereafter named points, are randomly placed in n-dimensional space, and coordinates are optimized from these starting conditions using the L-Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm, minimizing the sum of the squared differences between HI table distances and the map distances (Euclidian distance between points in the n-dimensional space). In an antigenic map, every direction represents antigenic distance, and one antigenic unit corresponds to a twofold change in HI titre.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, antigenic maps were computed using the ‘make.acmap’ function, with 1,000 optimization runs in three dimensions, and the minimum column basis set to zero. The antigenic map was validated using several tests, which are described in Supplementary Notes 2 and 3. Total map stress was extracted using the mapStress function and individual antigen stresses were extracted using the agStress function. HI table distances and pairwise antigen–serum Euclidian distances in the antigenic map were extracted using the tableDistances and mapDistances functions, respectively. When threshold HI titres (that is, <10) are converted to table distances in the process of making an antigenic map, the resulting values are not an exact distance but a ‘greater-than’ value, that is, thresholded distance. To include these points in the visualization in scatter plots of HI distances versus map distances (Extended Data Fig. 3a), and corresponding regression coefficient (R2) calculations (Extended Data Figs. 1c and 3a), these values were converted to the thresholded distance increased by 1 on the log 2 scale, for example, a threshold distance of >7 on the log 2 scale is converted to an 8. To compute distances between points in the map, antigen and serum coordinates were extracted using the agCoords and srCoords functions, respectively. The dist function (base R) was subsequently used to compute pairwise Euclidean distances between points in the map. The map centre was determined by computing the mean x, y and z of the antigen coordinates. Pairwise genetic hamming distances, that is, the number of amino acid differences between two antigens, were computed using the ‘stringDist’ function (method = ‘hamming’) from the Biostrings package (v.2.74.1)81.\n\nTo average and visualize the immune response of multiple ferrets belonging to the same experimental group (referred to as a mean serum), the GMTs of multiple vaccination sera against each individual antigen were computed to generate antibody profiles. Individual threshold titres were first converted to the closest possible numerical titre (for example, <10 to a 5) and, subsequently, GMTs were calculated. For the visualization of the reactivity of post-vaccination sera using the A(H5) antigenic map, antigenic maps were optimized with datasets containing the antigenic map HI data and HI data of a single post-vaccination serum or mean data of multiple post-vaccination sera as described above. The resulting maps including individual or mean post-vaccination sera data shared similar conformations, also corresponding to that of the antigenic map (the mean median Procrustes distance between each map with post-vaccination data and the antigenic map was 0.15 AU). Thus, to generate displays in which the positions of post-vaccination sera were visualized without changing the position of the antigens or sera in the antigenic map, maps, containing either individual or merged HI data, were superimposed onto the antigenic map using the mergeMaps function with the frozen-merge method. These maps were then used to visualize and analyse the reactivity of the post-vaccination sera to antigens in the antigenic map using custom R code (https://github.com/epiv-lab/H5-antigenic-evolution and Zenodo82). For analysis of mutant antigens, antigenic maps were computed with datasets containing HI data of a single mutant antigen in addition to the antigenic map dataset. The resulting optimized maps were used to calculate the distances described in the text. For visualization in Supplementary Data 5b, superimposed maps were generated as described above for the visualization of post-vaccination sera. The displays in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 8–10 were generated by superimposing an optimized map containing an individual single or mean post-vaccination serum, as described above, on the map from Supplementary Data 5b. Supplementary Video 1 was generated using the antigenic map displayed in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Data 2 using custom R code (https://github.com/epiv-lab/H5-antigenic-evolution and Zenodo82). In brief, individual frames were generated by taking screenshots of rotating r3js (v.0.0.2)83 antigenic map displays using R package webshot2 (v.0.1.2)84, which were subsequently assembled into a video using ffmpeg.\n\nResialylated TRBC assay\n\nResialylated TRBC assays were performed as described previously74. The pellet of 1.25 ml of 1% TRBCs was resuspended in 62.5 μl PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μl of 1 mU μl−1 V. cholerae neuraminidase (Roche) and 10 μl 0.1 M CaCl 2 to remove all sialic acids from the TRBCs. After two washes with PBS, the TRBCs were combined with 3.75 μl of 30 mM CMP-sialic acid (Merck), and either 5 μl of α2,3-sialyltransferase (recombinant human ST3GAL6, Fc Chimera, R&D systems) or 5 μl α2,6-sialyltransferase (Recombinant Human ST6GAL1 (amino acids 44–406) Protein, R&D Systems), and PBS up to 75 μl. Alternatively, 1 μg of in-house generated Pasteurella multocida sialyltransferase 1 (Pmst1) M144D (α2,3-sialyltransferase)85 or Pmst1 M144L P34H (α2,6-sialyltransferase)86 was used. TRBCs were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with the commercial enzymes or for 4 h with the in-house generated enzymes. After resialylation, TRBCs were washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA to a final concentration of 0.5% TRBCs. Besides α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic-acid-specific TRBCs, untreated and VNCA-treated TRBCs were taken along as controls when assessing the binding preference of viruses in HA assays. Moreover, in each independent assay, a minimum of three control viruses was used: one with α2,3-linked sialic acid specificity, one with α2,6-linked sialic acid specificity, and one with dual binding specificity.\n\nData visualization and statistics\n\nData were visualized with Racmacs (v.1.2.3)80, r3js (v.0.0.2)83 and/or ggplot2 (v.3.5.1)87 in R v.4.4.3 (used throughout). The interactive figure files in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Data 2–10) were generated with flexdashboard (v.0.6.2)88 in R. Statistical analyses were performed using the base R functions for the Kruskal–Wallis test and linear regressions. For the comparison of multiple experimental groups, the Kruskal–Wallis test was first performed. If positive, pairwise two-sided Dunn’s tests with Bonferroni correction were then performed (R packages FSA (v.0.10.0)89 and dunn.test (v.1.3.6))90 to assess the significance of differences between two experimental groups.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Influenza A(H5) viruses can change a lot, making it hard to create vaccines that protect against many different versions. Scientists want vaccines that work well even as the virus changes.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers created a detailed map showing how different A(H5) flu virus proteins vary. Using this map, they designed a vaccine based on a central version of the virus’s key protein, haemagglutinin (HA).

The team also shared their vaccine materials and data openly with other scientists worldwide.\n\n**Impact** – This vaccine design covers a wide range of virus types, which is important because flu viruses often change and cause new outbreaks. Having a vaccine that works broadly could help protect people better during flu pandemics caused by A(H5) viruses. The open sharing of materials means other researchers can build on this work quickly.\n\n**What's next step** – The vaccine needs to be tested further in more animals and eventually in humans to confirm its safety and effectiveness.

      "title": "This European treatment for joint pain just passed a major scientific test",
      "summary": "Korean researchers found that low-dose radiation therapy eased knee pain and improved movement in people with mild to moderate osteoarthritis. The treatment, far weaker than cancer radiation, showed real benefits beyond placebo. With no side effects and strong trial results, the approach could provide a middle ground between painkillers and joint surgery.",
      "content": "A new randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial suggests that a single round of low-dose radiation therapy could offer a safe and effective alternative for people suffering from painful knee osteoarthritis.\n\nParticipants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis experienced notable pain reduction and improved mobility within four months of receiving the treatment. The radiation exposure was only a tiny fraction of what is used in cancer therapy. Because the study included a control group that underwent a simulated treatment, researchers were able to clearly separate genuine treatment effects from placebo responses, which are common in osteoarthritis trials. Early results from this Korean study were presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting.\n\n\"People with painful knee osteoarthritis often face a difficult choice between the risks of side effects from pain medications and the risks of joint replacement surgery,\" said Byoung Hyuck Kim, MD, PhD, principal investigator on the trial and an assistant professor of radiation oncology at Seoul National University College of Medicine, Boramae Medical Center. \"There's a clinical need for moderate interventions between weak pain medications and aggressive surgery, and we think radiation may be a suitable option for those patients especially when drugs and injections are poorly tolerated.\"\n\nOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 32.5 million adults in the United States. It develops as the cartilage that cushions bone ends wears away over time. The condition often targets the knees and hips, limiting mobility and diminishing quality of life. Typical treatment begins with lifestyle adjustments and pain-relief medications, with surgery considered when symptoms become severe.\n\nLow-dose radiation therapy has long been used in European countries such as Germany and Spain to treat joint pain, where it is widely accepted. However, Dr. Kim noted that before this study, rigorous placebo-controlled evidence was scarce, and awareness of the treatment remained low among clinicians in other parts of the world.\n\n\"There is a misconception that medicinal, or therapeutic, radiation is always delivered in high doses,\" he said. \"But for osteoarthritis, the doses are only a small fraction of what we use for cancer, and the treatment targets joints that are positioned away from vital organs, which lowers the likelihood of side effects.\" In this study, he explained, the radiation dose was less than 5% of what is typically used in cancer therapy, and no radiation-related side effects were observed.\n\nThe multicenter study included 114 participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, recruited from three academic hospitals in Korea. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a very low dose (0.3 Gy), a low dose (3 Gy), or a control group that received simulated (sham) radiation. In the placebo group, patients went through the same setup as those receiving treatment, but no radiation was actually delivered. Each participant underwent six treatment sessions without knowing which group they were assigned to.\n\nTo ensure the results reflected the true effects of radiation, the researchers restricted the use of additional pain relievers, allowing only acetaminophen as needed during the four-month follow-up period. The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated using internationally recognized standards, identifying a participant as a \"responder\" if they achieved meaningful improvement in at least two of three measures: pain, physical function, and overall assessment of their condition. Participants also completed separate questionnaires addressing pain, stiffness, and mobility. No treatment-related side effects were reported.\n\nAfter four months, 70% of patients in the 3 Gy group met responder criteria, compared to 42% in the placebo group (p=0.014). Outcomes in the 0.3 Gy group were not significantly different from the control group (58.3% improved, p=0.157), indicating the 3 Gy regimen drove relief beyond placebo effects.\n\nMeaningful improvements in the composite score of pain, stiffness and physical function were reported more often in the 3 Gy group (56.8%) than in the placebo group (30.6%, p=0.024). For other secondary outcomes, including the amount of pain medication needed, there were no significant differences.\n\nDr. Kim said this trial differed from previous research in two critical ways. \"The sham-controlled design helped rule out placebo effects, and we limited stronger analgesics, which made differences between groups more clearly attributable to the radiation itself,\" he said.\n\n\"In previous studies, drugs such as NSAIDs or opioids were also used during the intervention or follow-up period. But using these pain relievers could mask the effects of radiation therapy,\" he said. Because analgesic use was limited to acetaminophen only during the four months of follow-up in this trial, \"that means the differences between treatment groups are more clearly attributable to the low-dose radiation therapy itself.\"\n\nResponses in the placebo arms were substantial -- about 40% met the criteria for treatment response without true radiation -- but are consistent with rates reported in prior osteoarthritis trials of injections or medications and in at least one similar European study, Dr. Kim said. \"It was surprising, and it underscores how important placebo-controlled designs are in osteoarthritis research. We need to examine this more closely in future studies.\"\n\nRadiation therapy may be best suited for patients with underlying inflammation and preserved joint structure, he explained. \"For severe osteoarthritis, where the joint is physically destroyed and cartilage is already gone, radiation will not regenerate tissue,\" Dr. Kim said. \"But for people with mild to moderate disease, this approach could delay the need for joint replacement.\"\n\nHe emphasized that low-dose radiation should be considered as part of shared decision-making alongside standard measures such as weight loss, physiotherapy, and medications. \"In clinical practice, responses could be even stronger when radiation is properly combined with other treatments, and patient satisfaction may be higher than with current options alone.\"\n\nThe research team is completing 12-month follow-up to assess durability of benefits and to correlate symptom relief with imaging-based measures of joint structure. Planned studies also include larger, pragmatic trials to evaluate outcomes in specific subgroups and health-economic analyses comparing low-dose radiation with injections and medication regimens.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Osteoarthritis is a common joint disease that causes pain and stiffness, especially in the knees. Many people manage it with painkillers or surgery, but these options have risks and limits. In Europe, low-dose radiation therapy has been used to treat joint pain, but strong scientific proof has been lacking.\n\n**What happened** – Korean researchers conducted a careful clinical trial with 114 people who had mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. They gave some patients very low doses of radiation, others a slightly higher dose, and a third group received fake treatment to compare results. The patients did not know which group they were in. After four months, those who got the higher dose of radiation (3 Gy) showed much less pain and better movement compared to the fake treatment group. No side effects were found.\n\n**Impact** – This study is important because it clearly shows that low-dose radiation can reduce knee pain without the side effects of strong pain medicines or surgery. The trial used a control group to rule out placebo effects, making the results more trustworthy. Since osteoarthritis affects millions worldwide, this treatment could help many people find relief with fewer risks.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will continue to follow the patients for a full year to see if the benefits last. They also plan bigger studies to test the treatment in different groups and compare its cost and effectiveness to other options like injections and drugs. This will help doctors decide when and how best to use low-dose radiation.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new study confirms that low-dose radiation therapy can safely reduce pain and improve movement in people with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, offering a promising treatment between painkillers and surgery.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’arthrose est une maladie courante qui cause douleur et raideur, surtout au niveau des genoux. Beaucoup de personnes utilisent des antidouleurs ou la chirurgie, mais ces options comportent des risques. En Europe, la radiothérapie à faible dose est utilisée pour traiter la douleur articulaire, mais les preuves scientifiques solides manquaient.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs coréens ont mené un essai clinique rigoureux avec 114 patients souffrant d’arthrose légère à modérée du genou. Certains ont reçu une très faible dose de radiation, d’autres une dose un peu plus élevée, et un troisième groupe un traitement factice. Les patients ignoraient leur groupe. Après quatre mois, ceux traités avec la dose plus élevée (3 Gy) ont ressenti beaucoup moins de douleur et une meilleure mobilité que le groupe placebo. Aucun effet secondaire n’a été observé.\n\n**Impact** – Cette étude est importante car elle montre clairement que la radiothérapie à faible dose peut réduire la douleur au genou sans les effets secondaires des médicaments forts ou de la chirurgie. Le groupe placebo a permis d’écarter l’effet placebo, rendant les résultats plus fiables. Comme l’arthrose touche des millions de personnes, ce traitement pourrait aider beaucoup à soulager leur douleur avec moins de risques.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs vont suivre les patients pendant un an pour vérifier si les bienfaits durent. Ils prévoient aussi des études plus larges pour tester le traitement sur différents groupes et comparer son coût et son efficacité avec d’autres options comme les injections ou les médicaments. Cela aidera les médecins à mieux utiliser cette thérapie.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Une nouvelle étude confirme que la radiothérapie à faible dose peut réduire en toute sécurité la douleur et améliorer la mobilité chez les personnes souffrant d’arthrose légère à modérée du genou, offrant un traitement prometteur entre antidouleurs et chirurgie.",
