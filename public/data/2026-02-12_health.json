      "title": "Changing when you eat dramatically reduced Crohn’s disease symptoms",
      "summary": "A new clinical trial suggests that changing when you eat could make a meaningful difference for people living with Crohn’s disease. Researchers found that time-restricted feeding, a form of intermittent fasting that limits meals to an 8-hour daily window, reduced disease activity by 40% and cut abdominal discomfort in half over 12 weeks. Participants also lost weight and showed healthier inflammation and immune markers, even though they did not reduce calories or change what they ate.",
      "content": "A randomized controlled trial funded by the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation found that time-restricted feeding, a type of intermittent fasting, significantly lowered disease activity and systemic inflammation in adults with Crohn's disease who also had overweight or obesity. Led by researchers at the University of Calgary, the study is the first to demonstrate that limiting meals to an 8-hour daily window can reduce Crohn's disease activity by 40% and cut abdominal discomfort by 50% within 12 weeks compared to a typical eating pattern.\n\nParticipants who followed the intermittent fasting schedule lost an average of about 5.5 pounds during the study, while those in the control group gained roughly 3.7 pounds. Blood tests also revealed meaningful improvements in markers linked to inflammation and immune function, including reduced levels of leptin and PAI-1. These changes occurred without any instructions to cut calories.\n\nThe findings were published in Gastroenterology. People with IBD are advised to consult their healthcare provider before adjusting their eating schedule to determine whether intermittent fasting is appropriate for them.\n\nHow Time-Restricted Feeding Works\n\nTime-restricted feeding (TRF) means consuming all meals within a defined 8-hour period each day and fasting for the remaining 16 hours. The 12-week study included 35 adults with Crohn's disease and living with obesity or overweight. Twenty participants were assigned to follow TRF, while 15 continued their regular diet. Researchers evaluated disease activity, inflammation, and body composition at both the beginning and the end of the trial.\n\n\"This study shows that while weight loss is an important outcome in people with overweight and Crohn's disease, time-restricted feeding offers additional benefits beyond just the scale,\" said Maitreyi Raman, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary, the study's senior author. \"We saw meaningful improvements in disease symptoms, reduced abdominal discomfort, favorable shifts in metabolism and inflammation, and promising changes in gut bacteria -- all suggesting that intermittent fasting may help patients maintain lasting remission from Crohn's disease.\"\n\nSupport From the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation\n\nThe research received funding through the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation's Litwin IBD Pioneers program. \"Time-restricted feeding is showing real promise as a new way to help people with Crohn's disease manage not only their symptoms but also their overall health,\" said Andres Lorenzo Hurtado, PhD, Senior Vice President of Translational Research & IBD Ventures at the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation. \"This research suggests that changing when we eat -- not just what we eat -- can improve metabolism, help the immune system work better, and support long-term remission from Crohn's disease. We are excited to support studies like this that put patients at the center of new solutions and encourage more research to make these benefits last for everyone living with IBD.\"\n\n\"People with Crohn's disease often look for practical tools to support their health alongside medication,\" said Natasha Haskey, PhD, RD, Research Associate at the University of British Columbia and lead investigator in the study. \"Our research suggests time-restricted eating may be a sustainable option grounded in biology, offering patients more ways to manage their own wellness.\"\n\nReduced Visceral Fat and Gut Inflammation\n\nBeyond easing symptoms, participants in the intermittent fasting group experienced a significant reduction in harmful visceral fat and key inflammatory signals in the bloodstream. Because both groups consumed similar foods in comparable amounts, the improvements were not simply the result of better diet quality or lower calorie intake. Instead, the findings indicate that meal timing itself may play an important role in digestive and immune health.\n\nAlthough the results are encouraging, researchers stress that larger studies are necessary to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of time-restricted feeding for a broader population of people living with IBD.\n\nThis research was funded by Crohn's Colitis Foundation, Litwin IBD Pioneers Grant (ID: 879104) and Imagine Network (University of Calgary).",

      "title": "Just 5 weeks of brain training may protect against dementia for 20 years",
      "summary": "A simple brain-training program that sharpens how quickly older adults process visual information may have a surprisingly powerful long-term payoff. In a major 20-year study of adults 65 and older, those who completed five to six weeks of adaptive “speed of processing” training — along with a few booster sessions — were significantly less likely to develop dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, even two decades later. Participants who received the boosted speed training had a 25% lower dementia risk compared to those who received no training, making it the only intervention in the trial to show such a lasting protective effect.",
      "content": "Older adults who took part in a short program designed to sharpen how quickly they process visual information were less likely to develop dementia years later. The training, known as speed of processing training, teaches people to rapidly spot visual details on a computer screen and manage increasingly complex tasks in less time. Participants who completed five to six weeks of sessions, along with follow up booster sessions one to three years later, showed a reduced risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, up to 20 years later. The findings were published February 9 in Alzheimer's & Dementia: Translational Research and Clinical Interventions.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is the first randomized clinical trial to track dementia outcomes over two decades in older adults who underwent cognitive training. The participants were part of the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study. Beginning in 1998-99, researchers enrolled 2,802 adults and randomly assigned them to one of three cognitive training groups or to a control group that received no training.\n\nThe three interventions focused on memory, reasoning, or speed of processing. Those in the training groups completed up to 10 sessions lasting 60-75 minutes over five to six weeks. About half were also randomly selected to receive as many as four additional booster sessions at 11 and 35 months after the initial program.\n\n20 Year Follow Up Results\n\nTwo decades later, researchers analyzed long term outcomes. Among participants who completed speed training and booster sessions, 105 out of 264 (40%) were diagnosed with dementia. In comparison, 239 out of 491 (49%) people in the control group developed dementia. That represents a 25% lower incidence in the speed training group with boosters. Importantly, speed training was the only intervention that showed a statistically significant difference compared to the control group.\n\nTo assess dementia diagnoses, investigators reviewed Medicare records from 2,021 participants (72% of the original study) between 1999 and 2019. The follow up group closely reflected the original study population. About three fourths were women, 70% were white, and the average age at the start was 74. Over the 20 year period, roughly three fourths of participants died (at an average age of 84).\n\nWhy Dementia Prevention Matters\n\nDementia involves a decline in thinking and memory severe enough to interfere with daily life and independent living. It is estimated to affect 42% of adults older than age 55 at some point in their lives and costs the United States more than $600 billion annually. Alzheimer's disease accounts for approximately 60%-80% of cases, while vascular dementia represents about 5%-10%. Other forms include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, or mixed types.\n\n\"Seeing that boosted speed training was linked to lower dementia risk two decades later is remarkable because it suggests that a fairly modest nonpharmacological intervention can have long-term effects,\" says Marilyn Albert, Ph.D., the corresponding study author and director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine. \"Even small delays in the onset of dementia may have a large impact on public health and help reduce rising health care costs.\"\n\nAlbert noted that further research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms behind these results and why memory and reasoning training did not produce the same long term associations.\n\nHow Speed Training May Protect the Brain\n\nThe new findings build on earlier ACTIVE trial results. Previous analyses showed that cognitive training improved everyday thinking skills for up to five years. After 10 years, all three training types were associated with better daily functioning. Participants who completed speed training had a 29% lower dementia incidence at the 10 year mark compared to the control group. Each booster session was tied to additional reductions in risk.\n\nResearchers believe speed training may have been especially effective because it was adaptive. The program adjusted the level of difficulty based on each person's performance that day. Individuals who performed well progressed to more challenging tasks, while those who needed more time worked at a slower pace. In contrast, the memory and reasoning programs taught the same strategies to everyone.\n\nSpeed training also relies on implicit learning, which functions more like building a skill or habit. Memory and reasoning training depend on explicit learning, which involves consciously learning facts and techniques. Scientists know that implicit and explicit learning engage different brain systems, and this distinction may help explain why only speed training was associated with lower dementia risk in this analysis.\n\n\"Our findings provide support for the development and refinement of cognitive training interventions for older adults, particularly those that target visual processing and divided attention abilities,\" says site principal investigator George Rebok, Ph.D., a lifespan developmental psychologist who creates community programs for healthy aging and is a professor emeritus of mental health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"It is possible that adding this cognitive training to lifestyle change interventions may delay dementia onset, but that remains to be studied.\"\n\nThe authors suggest that speed training could potentially complement other healthy aging strategies that support brain connections, although more research is required to confirm this. Other behaviors linked to lower cognitive decline risk include maintaining heart health by monitoring blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, and body weight, along with regular physical activity.\n\nAdditional study authors include Norma B. Coe, Chuxuan Sun and Elizabeth Taggert (University of Pennsylvania), Katherine E. M. Miller and Alden L. Gross (the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health), Richard N. Jones (Brown University), Cynthia Felix (University of Pittsburgh), Michael Marsiske (University of Florida), Karlene K. Ball (University of Alabama at Birmingham) and Sherry L. Willis (University of Washington).\n\nThis study was supported by NIH grants from the National Institute on Aging (R01AG056486). The original ACTIVE trial was funded through NIH grants awarded to six field sites and the coordinating center, including Hebrew Senior-Life, Boston (NR04507), the Indiana University School of Medicine (NR04508), The Johns Hopkins University (AG014260), the New England Research Institutes (AG014282), the Pennsylvania State University (AG14263), the University of Alabama at Birmingham (AG14289) and Wayne State University/University of Florida (AG014276).",

      "content": "A gene therapy that patients breathe in has been found to shrink lung tumours by inserting immune-boosting genes into surrounding cells\n\nThe gene therapy is administered as a mist that is inhaled Nico De Pasquale Photography/Getty Images\n\nA first-of-its-kind inhalable gene therapy for lung cancer that genetically modifies people’s lung cells has been fast-tracked towards potential approval after promising clinical trial results.\n\n“Very encouragingly, the hypothesis was proven – that there was actually shrinkage of the tumours in the lungs,” Wen Wee Ma at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio told a recent meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.\n\nThe treatment is novel because it uses a virus to carry immune-boosting genes into lung cells, which makes them better at fighting tumours on their own. Gene therapy usually involves replacing faulty copies of crucial genes.\n\nAnother unusual aspect is that it is breathed in rather than swallowed or injected. “It’s such a different way of giving anti-cancer treatment,” said Ma. The advantage of this mode of delivery is that it gets the therapy directly into the lungs. One reason why lung cancer is the deadliest form of the disease is that treatments given orally or intravenously struggle to make it to the lungs.\n\nThe new therapy contains a herpes virus that has been modified to make it harmless and unable to spread to other people. The virus is tasked with dragging two genes, one encoding the protein interleukin-2 and the other encoding interleukin-12, into lung cells. These are naturally produced in the body and help to suppress tumour growth. However, tumours often fight back and deplete them, so the gene therapy is designed to restore their production.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nSince 2024, Ma and his colleagues have been testing the gene therapy in people with advanced lung cancer who have exhausted all other treatment options. To administer it, a liquid containing the gene therapy is nebulised, meaning it is converted into a fine mist that people directly inhale into their lungs from a device.\n\nAt the oncology meeting, Ma announced that the gene therapy had reduced the size of lung tumours in three out of 11 people, and stopped them from growing any bigger in another five people. Some patients experienced side effects like chills or vomiting, but no severe safety concerns were identified.\n\nBased on these positive results, the gene therapy received “regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation” from the US Food and Drug Administration this week. This means the agency will seek to expedite its approval so patients can access it as soon as possible.\n\nOne drawback of the gene therapy is that it only targets tumours that are confined to the lungs, not when they have spread to other parts of the body. To address this, Ma and his colleagues are now testing it in combination with immunotherapies and chemotherapies, in trials that will involve about 250 patients.\n\nKrystal Biotech, the company that developed the gene therapy, previously created the first-approved gene therapy that is rubbed into the skin. This uses the same modified herpes virus to carry collagen genes into the skin of people with a rare blistering skin condition called recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, thereby helping to repair their skin.\n\nThe company is also working on inhalable gene therapies for cystic fibrosis and a genetic lung condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",

Se reportaron algunos efectos secundarios leves, sin problemas serios de seguridad.\n\n**Impacto** – Es la primera vez que una terapia génica se administra por inhalación, lo que lleva el tratamiento directamente a los pulmones. Esto ayuda a resolver un gran problema en el tratamiento del cáncer de pulmón. La Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de EE.UU. (FDA) le dio a esta terapia un estatus de aprobación rápida, lo que significa que podría llegar a los pacientes más pronto. Esto podría cambiar cómo se trata el cáncer de pulmón en el futuro.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores probarán esta terapia génica junto con otros tratamientos como inmunoterapia y quimioterapia. Planean incluir alrededor de 250 pacientes en estos nuevos ensayos. Actualmente, la terapia solo funciona cuando el cáncer está limitado a los pulmones, por lo que combinarla con otros tratamientos podría ayudar a pacientes con enfermedad más avanzada.\n\n**Frase clave** – Una nueva terapia génica inhalable que ayuda a los pulmones a combatir el cáncer ha mostrado éxito temprano y avanza rápidamente hacia la aprobación de la FDA.",

      "title": "This bedroom temperature could help older adults sleep with less stress",
      "summary": "A cooler bedroom might be better for older sleepers than previously thought. Researchers found that keeping nighttime temperatures at 75°F reduced stress responses and helped the heart work more efficiently during sleep. Hot nights usually force the heart to work harder, interfering with recovery. As climate change drives warmer nights, this small adjustment could make a big difference.",
      "content": "New research from Griffith University suggests that keeping a bedroom at 24°C (75°F) overnight can lower stress responses during sleep in older adults. The findings point to bedroom temperature as an important and often overlooked factor in nighttime recovery.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. Fergus O'Connor from Griffith's School of Allied Health, Sport and Social Work. His research focused on how higher nighttime bedroom temperatures influence heart rate and stress levels in older people.\n\n\"For individuals aged 65 years and over, maintaining overnight bedroom temperatures at 24°C reduced the likelihood of experiencing heightened stress responses during sleep,\" Dr. O'Connor said.\n\nWhy Heat Increases Stress on the Body\n\nDr. O'Connor explained that heat places extra demands on the cardiovascular system.\n\n\"When the human body is exposed to heat, its normal physiological response is to increase the heart rate. The heart is working harder to try and circulate blood to the skin surface for cooling.\n\n\"However, when the heart works harder and for longer, it creates stress and limits our capacity to recover from the previous day's heat exposure.\"\n\nTracking Sleep in Real-World Conditions\n\nParticipants in the study wore fitness activity trackers on their non-dominant wrist to record heart-related data during sleep. At the same time, temperature sensors installed in their bedrooms continuously measured overnight conditions throughout the Australian summer-long data collection period.\n\nThe results provided the first real-world evidence showing how higher bedroom temperatures directly affect heart rate and stress responses during sleep.\n\nHot Nights, Climate Change, and Health Risks\n\nAccording to Dr. O'Connor, the findings are especially relevant as nighttime temperatures continue to rise. \"Climate change is increasing the frequency of hot nights, which may independently contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by impairing sleep and autonomic recovery,\" he said.\n\nHe also noted an important gap in existing guidance. \"While there are guidelines for maximum daytime indoor temperature, 26°C, there are no equivalent recommendations for nighttime conditions.\"\n\nThe research paper, 'Effect of nighttime bedroom temperature on heart rate variability in older adults: an observational study', has been published in BMC Medicine.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – As the world warms and nights get hotter, older adults often struggle to sleep well. Heat can make the heart work harder and increase stress during sleep, affecting recovery and health.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Griffith University studied people aged 65 and older. They found that keeping bedrooms at 24°C (75°F) overnight helped reduce stress responses and made the heart work more efficiently during sleep. Participants wore fitness trackers to measure heart rate while temperature sensors tracked bedroom heat over the Australian summer.\n\n**Impact** – This study shows, for the first time in real-life conditions, that cooler bedroom temperatures can lower stress on the heart during sleep for older adults. Since climate change is causing more hot nights, this simple change could protect heart health and improve sleep quality.\n\n**What's next step** – The research highlights the need for official nighttime temperature guidelines to help people sleep better. Future studies may explore how to best keep bedrooms cool and test these findings in different climates.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Keeping bedrooms at 75°F can reduce heart stress and improve sleep for older adults, especially as nights grow warmer due to climate change.",
