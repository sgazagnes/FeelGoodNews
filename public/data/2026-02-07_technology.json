      "title": "Scientists create smart synthetic skin that can hide images and change shape",
      "summary": "Inspired by the shape-shifting skin of octopuses, Penn State researchers developed a smart hydrogel that can change appearance, texture, and shape on command. The material is programmed using a special printing technique that embeds digital instructions directly into the skin. Images and information can remain invisible until triggered by heat, liquids, or stretching.",
      "content": "Synthetic materials are widely used across science, engineering, and industry, but most are designed to perform only a narrow range of tasks. A research team at Penn State set out to change that. Led by Hongtao Sun, assistant professor of industrial and manufacturing engineering (IME), the group developed a new fabrication technique that can produce multifunctional \"smart synthetic skin.\" These adaptable materials can be programmed to perform a wide variety of tasks, including hiding or revealing information, enabling adaptive camouflage, and supporting soft robotic systems.\n\nUsing this new approach, the researchers created a programmable smart skin made from hydrogel, a soft, water-rich material. Unlike conventional synthetic materials with fixed behaviors, this smart skin can be tuned to respond in multiple ways. Its appearance, mechanical behavior, surface texture, and ability to change shape can all be adjusted when the material is exposed to external triggers such as heat, solvents, or physical stress.\n\nThe findings were published in Nature Communications, where the study was also selected for Editors' Highlights.\n\nInspired by Octopus Skin and Living Systems\n\nSun, the project's principal investigator, said the concept was inspired by cephalopods such as octopuses, which can rapidly alter the look and texture of their skin. These animals use such changes to blend into their surroundings or communicate with one another.\n\n\"Cephalopods use a complex system of muscles and nerves to exhibit dynamic control over the appearance and texture of their skin,\" Sun said. \"Inspired by these soft organisms, we developed a 4D-printing system to capture that idea in a synthetic, soft material.\"\n\nSun also holds affiliations in biomedical engineering, material science and engineering, and the Materials Research Institute at Penn State. He described the process as 4D printing because the printed objects are not static. Instead, they can actively change in response to environmental conditions.\n\nPrinting Digital Instructions Into Material\n\nTo achieve this adaptability, the team used a method called halftone-encoded printing. This technique converts image or texture data into binary ones and zeros and embeds that information directly into the material. The approach is similar to how dot patterns are used in newspapers or photographs to create images.\n\nBy encoding these digital patterns within the hydrogel, the researchers can program how the smart skin reacts to different stimuli. The printed patterns determine how various regions of the material respond. Some areas may swell, shrink, or soften more than others when exposed to temperature changes, liquids, or mechanical forces. By carefully designing these patterns, the team can control the material's overall behavior.\n\n\"In simple terms, we're printing instructions into the material,\" Sun explained. \"Those instructions tell the skin how to react when something changes around it.\"\n\nHiding and Revealing Images on Demand\n\nOne of the most eye-catching demonstrations involved the material's ability to conceal and reveal visual information. Haoqing Yang, a doctoral candidate in IME and the paper's first author, said this capability highlights the potential of the smart skin.\n\nTo demonstrate the effect, the team encoded an image of the Mona Lisa into the hydrogel film. When the material was washed with ethanol, it appeared transparent and showed no visible image. The hidden image became clear only after the film was placed in ice water or gradually heated.\n\nYang noted that the Mona Lisa was used only as an example. The printing technique allows virtually any image to be encoded into the hydrogel.\n\n\"This behavior could be used for camouflage, where a surface blends into its environment, or for information encryption, where messages are hidden and only revealed under specific conditions,\" Yang said.\n\nThe researchers also showed that concealed patterns could be detected by gently stretching the material and analyzing how it deforms using digital image correlation analysis. This means information can be revealed not only visually, but also through mechanical interaction, adding an extra level of security.\n\nShape Shifting Without Multiple Layers\n\nThe smart skin also demonstrated remarkable flexibility. According to Sun, the material can easily shift from a flat sheet into complex, bio-inspired shapes with detailed surface textures. Unlike many other shape-changing materials, this transformation does not require multiple layers or different substances.\n\nInstead, the changes in shape and texture are controlled entirely by the digitally printed halftone patterns within a single sheet. This allows the material to replicate effects similar to those seen in cephalopod skin.\n\nBuilding on this capability, the team showed that multiple functions can be programmed to work together. By carefully designing the halftone patterns, they encoded the Mona Lisa image into flat films that later transformed into three-dimensional forms. As the sheets curved into dome-like shapes, the hidden image slowly appeared, showing that changes in shape and visual appearance can be coordinated within one material.\n\n\"Similar to how cephalopods coordinate body shape and skin patterning, the synthetic smart skin can simultaneously control what it looks like and how it deforms, all within a single, soft material,\" Sun said.\n\nExpanding the Potential of 4D-Printed Hydrogels\n\nSun said the new work builds on earlier research by the team on 4D-printed smart hydrogels, which was also published in Nature Communications. That earlier study focused on combining mechanical properties with programmable transitions from flat to three-dimensional forms. In the current research, the team expanded the approach by using halftone-encoded 4D printing to integrate even more functions into a single hydrogel film.\n\nLooking ahead, the researchers aim to create a scalable and versatile platform that allows precise digital encoding of multiple functions within one adaptive material.\n\n\"This interdisciplinary research at the intersection of advanced manufacturing, intelligent materials and mechanics opens new opportunities with broad implications for stimulus-responsive systems, biomimetic engineering, advanced encryption technologies, biomedical devices and more,\" Sun said.\n\nThe study also included Penn State co-authors Haotian Li and Juchen Zhang, both doctoral candidates in IME, and Tengxiao Liu, a lecturer in biomedical engineering. H. Jerry Qi, professor of mechanical engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, also collaborated on the project.",

      "title": "A clever quantum trick brings practical quantum computers closer",
      "summary": "Quantum computers struggle because their qubits are incredibly easy to disrupt, especially during calculations. A new experiment shows how to perform quantum operations while continuously fixing errors, rather than pausing protection to compute. The team used a method called lattice surgery to split a protected qubit into two entangled ones without losing control. This breakthrough moves quantum machines closer to scaling up into something truly powerful.",
      "content": "Quantum computers have the potential to transform fields ranging from materials science to cryptography, but today they remain extremely difficult to build and operate. One of the biggest challenges comes from decoherence, a process that introduces errors into quantum systems. These errors usually take the form of bit flips or phase flips. A bit flip occurs when a qubit unexpectedly switches between '0' and '1'. A phase flip happens when the phase of a quantum superposition suddenly reverses, changing from positive to negative.\n\nBecause these changes can happen at random, even a single error can disrupt a calculation. Preventing that disruption is one of the central problems facing quantum engineers.\n\nProtecting Information With Logical Qubits\n\nTo reduce these errors, researchers combine many physical qubits into a single logical qubit and apply continuous error correction. This strategy helps preserve quantum information over time, making storage relatively stable. But storing information is only part of the task. To run a quantum algorithm, qubits must be actively manipulated using quantum gates, which are the basic operations that power quantum computation.\n\nApplying those operations without introducing new errors has proven far more difficult than simply keeping qubits stable at rest.\n\nA New Way to Compute While Fixing Errors\n\nA team led by D-PHYS Professor Andreas Wallraff has now demonstrated a method that tackles this problem directly. Working with researchers from the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) and theorists led by Professor Markus Müller at RWTH Aachen University and Forschungszentrum Jülich, the group showed how to perform quantum operations between superconducting logical qubits while correcting errors at the same time. Their findings were recently published in Nature Physics.\n\nThe work marks an important advance toward fault tolerant quantum computing, where calculations can proceed without being derailed by constant errors.\n\nWhy Quantum Error Correction Is Different\n\nError correction in classical computers relies on copying information. Multiple identical bits can be stored, checked later, and compared. If one flips, a majority vote reveals the correct value. That approach does not work in quantum systems.\n\n\"With qubits, things are a lot more complicated,\" says Dr. Ilya Besedin, a postdoctoral researcher in Wallraff's group and co-leading author of the study alongside PhD student Michael Kerschbaum. Quantum information cannot be copied or cloned. Instead, it must be distributed across entangled qubits. On top of that, quantum systems suffer from phase flip errors, which have no equivalent in classical computing and require their own correction methods.\n\nError Correction With Surface Codes\n\nOne widely used solution involves surface codes. In this approach, the information of a single qubit is spread across several physical data qubits. Error detection relies on repeated measurements of stabilizers, which work alongside the data qubits to form the logical qubit.\n\nThese stabilizers are monitored using additional qubits connected to the data qubits. Measuring them reveals whether a bit flip or phase flip has occurred between checks. Z-type stabilizers detect changes in bit value, while X-type stabilizers detect phase changes. Importantly, the data qubits themselves are never directly measured, allowing them to safely store the corrected quantum state.\n\nThe Challenge of Performing Logical Operations\n\nThe process becomes more complex when researchers want to apply a logical operation such as a controlled-NOT gate between two logical qubits. Errors can occur during the operation itself, and those errors must also be corrected.\n\n\"Performing a logical operation in this fault-tolerant way would be relatively easy if we could move our qubits around and connect them arbitrarily to each other,\" says Kerschbaum. In superconducting quantum processors, however, qubits are fixed in place. Only neighboring qubits can interact, which limits how operations can be carried out.\n\nSplitting the Square With Lattice Surgery\n\nTo work within those constraints, the team turned to a method known as lattice surgery. In their experiment, the researchers began with a single logical qubit encoded across seventeen physical qubits. The data qubits and stabilizers were arranged in a roughly square pattern. Over several cycles, stabilizers were measured every 1.66 microseconds to correct both bit flips and phase flips.\n\nAt a key moment, three data qubits running through the center of the square were measured. This step effectively divided the surface code into two separate halves. At the same time, measurements of the X-type stabilizers were paused.\n\n\"The end result of this operation was that we had two logical qubits entangled with each other,\" explains Besedin. During the splitting process, bit flip errors continued to be corrected. Afterward, bit flip error correction resumed independently on each half. While this operation does not yet produce a controlled-NOT gate on its own, it can be combined with additional splitting and merging steps to create one.\n\nA First for Superconducting Qubits\n\n\"One could say that the lattice surgery operation is the operation, and all the others can be constructed from it,\" says Besedin.\n\nHe adds, \"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time lattice surgery has been performed on superconducting qubits,\" he adds, \"and we still have some way to go. For instance, 41 physical qubits would be required to make the splitting operation on one logical qubit stable against phase flips too. Nonetheless, this demonstration of lattice surgery on superconducting qubits marks an important step towards the ambitious goal of building useful quantum computers with thousands of qubits.",

      "title": "A superfluid freezes and breaks the rules of physics",
      "summary": "Physicists have watched a quantum fluid do something once thought almost impossible: stop moving. In experiments with ultra-thin graphene, researchers observed a superfluid—normally defined by its endless, frictionless flow—freeze into a strange new state that looks solid yet still belongs to the quantum world. This long-sought phase, known as a supersolid, blends crystal-like order with superfluid behavior and has puzzled scientists for decades.",
      "content": "When everyday matter is cooled, it follows a familiar path. A gas becomes a liquid, and with further cooling, that liquid turns into a solid. Quantum matter does not always follow these rules. More than a century ago, scientists discovered that helium behaves in an unexpected way at extremely low temperatures. Instead of freezing, it transforms from a normal gas into a superfluid, a rare state of matter that flows without any resistance and displays strange behaviors, including creeping up the sides of containers.\n\nPhysicists have long wondered what would happen if a superfluid were cooled even further. Despite decades of effort, that question remained unanswered for nearly 50 years.\n\nA Superfluid That Comes to a Halt\n\nIn new research published in Nature, a team led by physicists Cory Dean of Columbia University and Jia Li of the University of Texas at Austin reports a striking result. They observed a superfluid, which typically remains in constant motion, suddenly stop moving. \"For the first time, we've seen a superfluid undergo a phase transition to become what appears to be a supersolid,\" said Dean. The change is comparable to water freezing into ice, but taking place in the quantum realm.\n\nWhat Is a Supersolid?\n\nA classical solid is defined by atoms locked into a rigid, repeating crystal structure. A supersolid is the quantum version of this idea. It is predicted to have an ordered, solid-like arrangement while also retaining properties normally associated with liquids, including frictionless flow. This combination makes supersolids one of the most unusual states of matter proposed by physics.\n\nUntil now, however, no experiment had clearly shown a superfluid naturally transforming into a supersolid. This includes helium and all other known forms of matter. Some laboratory demonstrations have mimicked supersolids using highly controlled setups created by atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physicists. These experiments rely on lasers and optical components to form a periodic trap that forces particles into a repeating pattern, similar to how Jello takes shape inside an ice cube tray.\n\nTurning to Graphene for Answers\n\nA supersolid that forms on its own, without artificial confinement, has remained one of the most debated mysteries in condensed matter physics. Dean's team took a different approach by working with graphene, a naturally occurring material made of a single layer of carbon atoms. The group included Li, who conducted the work while he was a postdoc at Columbia, and Yihang Zeng (now an assistant professor at Purdue University), a former PhD student in the group.\n\nGraphene can support particles known as excitons. These quasiparticles appear when two atom-thin graphene sheets are stacked together and tuned so that one layer contains extra electrons while the other contains extra holes (which are left behind when electrons leave the layer in response to light). Because electrons carry a negative charge and holes act as positive charges, the two can bind together to form excitons. Under a strong magnetic field, these excitons can behave collectively as a superfluid.\n\nA Surprising Phase Change in a 2D Material\n\nTwo-dimensional materials like graphene are powerful tools for studying quantum behavior because their properties can be carefully adjusted. Researchers can control factors such as temperature, electromagnetic fields, and even the spacing between layers. As Dean's team tuned these parameters, they noticed an unexpected pattern linking exciton density and temperature.\n\nWhen excitons were densely packed, they flowed freely as a superfluid. As the density dropped, the flow stopped entirely, and the system became an insulator. Raising the temperature restored the superfluid behavior. This sequence ran counter to long-standing assumptions about how superfluidity works.\n\n\"Superfluidity is generally regarded as the low-temperature ground state,\" said Li. \"Observing an insulating phase that melts into a superfluid is unprecedented. This strongly suggests that the low-temperature phase is a highly unusual exciton solid.\"\n\nIs It Truly a Supersolid?\n\nWhether this state fully qualifies as a supersolid remains an open question. \"We are left to speculate some, as our ability to interrogate insulators stops a little,\" explained Dean -- their expertise is in transport measurements, and insulators don't transport a current. \"For now, we're exploring the boundaries around this insulating state, while building new tools to measure it directly.\"\n\nWhat Comes Next for Supersolids\n\nThe team is now investigating other layered materials that could host similar quantum phases. In bilayer graphene, the excitonic superfluid and likely supersolid only appear under strong magnetic fields. Other materials are harder to fabricate in the required configurations, but they may allow excitons to remain stable at higher temperatures and without the need for a magnetic field.\n\nBeing able to control superfluids in two-dimensional materials could have far-reaching implications. Compared to helium, for example, excitons are thousands of times lighter, so they could form exotic quantum states at much higher temperatures. While supersolids are still not fully understood, these findings provide strong evidence that 2D materials will play a central role in uncovering how this strange quantum phase works.",

Trouver cela dans le graphène est important car cela montre que les matériaux en 2D peuvent créer de nouveaux états quantiques qui remettent en question les idées actuelles de la physique.\n\n**Prochaines étapes**  \nLes scientifiques veulent explorer d’autres matériaux en couches pour voir s’ils peuvent aussi former des supersolides, peut-être à des températures plus élevées ou sans champs magnétiques forts. Ils développent de nouveaux outils pour étudier plus directement cet état isolant de supersolide et espèrent que cette recherche aidera à comprendre ces phases quantiques étranges.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase**  \nDes physiciens ont observé un superfluide dans le graphène se figer en un supersolide, révélant un état quantique rare qui mélange ordre solide et écoulement sans friction.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto**  \nLos superfluidos son líquidos especiales que fluyen sin fricción, incluso subiendo por las paredes del recipiente. Normalmente, cuando una sustancia se enfría, el líquido se convierte en sólido. Pero los superfluidos no siguen esta regla. Durante décadas, los científicos se preguntaron si un superfluido podría dejar de moverse y volverse sólido manteniendo sus propiedades cuánticas.\n\n**Qué pasó**  \nInvestigadores de la Universidad de Columbia y la Universidad de Texas estudiaron capas ultrafinas de grafeno, un material hecho de átomos de carbono de un solo átomo de grosor. Descubrieron que un superfluido formado por partículas llamadas excitones de repente dejó de moverse y formó un nuevo estado llamado supersólido. Este estado parece sólido pero sigue comportándose como un superfluido. El hallazgo fue publicado en la revista Nature.\n\n**Impacto**  \nEsta es la primera observación clara de un superfluido que se convierte naturalmente en un supersólido, sin usar trampas artificiales o láseres. Los supersólidos solo se habían predicho antes y eran muy difíciles de probar en materiales reales. Encontrar esto en grafeno es importante porque muestra que los materiales 2D pueden crear nuevos estados cuánticos que desafían las ideas actuales de la física.\n\n**Próximo paso**  \nLos científicos quieren explorar otros materiales en capas para ver si también pueden formar supersólidos, tal vez a temperaturas más altas o sin campos magnéticos fuertes. Están desarrollando nuevas herramientas para estudiar directamente el estado aislante del supersólido y esperan que esta investigación ayude a entender estas extrañas fases cuánticas.\n\n**Una frase clave**  \nFísicos observaron un superfluido en grafeno congelarse en un supersólido, revelando un raro estado cuántico que mezcla orden sólido con flujo sin fricción.",
