      "summary": "Researchers at Stanford found a way to cure or prevent Type 1 diabetes in mice using a combined blood stem cell and islet cell transplant. The procedure creates a hybrid immune system that stops autoimmune attacks and eliminates the need for immune-suppressing drugs. The method uses tools already common in clinical practice, putting human trials within reach. Scientists think the same strategy could transform treatments for autoimmune conditions and organ transplantation.",
      "content": "Stanford Medicine scientists report that giving mice both blood-forming stem cells and pancreatic islet cells from an immunologically mismatched donor either completely prevented or fully reversed Type 1 diabetes. In this disease, the body's own immune defenses mistakenly attack and destroy the insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas.\n\nNone of the animals developed graft-versus-host disease, a condition in which the immune system arising from the donated blood stem cells attacks healthy tissue in the recipient, and the destruction of islet cells by the animals' original immune system came to a stop. After receiving the transplants, the mice no longer needed immune suppressive drugs or insulin at any point during the six-month study.\n\n\"The possibility of translating these findings into humans is very exciting,\" said Seung K. Kim, MD, PhD, the KM Mulberry Professor and a professor of developmental biology, gerontology, endocrinology and metabolism. \"The key steps in our study -- which result in animals with a hybrid immune system containing cells from both the donor and the recipient -- are already being used in the clinic for other conditions. We believe this approach will be transformative for people with Type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune diseases, as well as for those who need solid organ transplants.\"\n\nKim, who directs the Stanford Diabetes Research Center and the Northern California Breakthrough T1D Center of Excellence, is the senior author of the study, which published online Nov. 18 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Graduate and medical student Preksha Bhagchandani is the lead author of the research.\n\nBuilding on earlier stem cell and islet work\n\nThe new results extend a 2022 study by Kim and his collaborators. In that earlier work, the researchers first triggered diabetes in mice by using toxins to destroy the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. They then used a gentle pre-transplant preparation involving immune-targeting antibodies and low-dose radiation, followed by a transplant of blood stem cells and islet cells from an unrelated donor, to restore blood sugar control.\n\nIn the latest study, the team set out to solve a more difficult challenge: preventing or curing diabetes driven by autoimmunity, where the immune system spontaneously targets and kills the body's own islet cells. In people, this form of the disease is known as Type 1 diabetes. Unlike the induced-diabetes model, where the main goal was to stop the recipient's immune system from rejecting donor islet cells, the new model involved transplanted islets that faced two problems at once. They were recognized as foreign tissue and were also targeted by an immune system already primed to attack islet cells from any source.\n\n\"Just like in human Type 1 diabetes, the diabetes that occurs in these mice results from an immune system that spontaneously attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in pancreatic islets,\" Kim said. \"We need to not only replace the islets that have been lost but also reset the recipient's immune system to prevent ongoing islet cell destruction. Creating a hybrid immune system accomplishes both goals.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the same biological traits that cause autoimmune diabetes in these mice also make them harder to prepare safely for a blood stem cell transplant.\n\nSimple drug tweak enables full diabetes protection\n\nThe team found a relatively straightforward way around this problem. Bhagchandani and Stephan Ramos, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow and co-author of the study, added a medication commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases to the pre-transplant regimen that had been identified in 2022. With this adjusted protocol, followed by blood stem cell transplantation, the mice developed a hybrid immune system made up of cells from both donor and recipient and did not go on to develop Type 1 diabetes in 19 out of 19 cases. In a separate group of animals with long-standing Type 1 diabetes, nine out of nine were cured after receiving the combined blood stem cell and islet cell transplant.\n\nBecause the antibodies, drugs and low-dose radiation used in the mice are already part of standard clinical practice for blood stem cell transplantation, the researchers see moving this strategy toward trials in people with Type 1 diabetes as a realistic next step.\n\nFrom kidney tolerance to hybrid immunity for diabetes\n\nThis new work builds on research led by the late Samuel Strober, MD, PhD, a professor of immunology and rheumatology, and his colleagues, including study co-author and professor of medicine Judith Shizuru, MD, PhD. Strober, Shizuru and other Stanford investigators had shown that a bone marrow transplant from a partially immunologically matched human donor could create a hybrid immune system in the recipient and allow long-term acceptance of a kidney transplant from the same donor. In some patients, they found that kidney function from the transplanted organ remained stable for decades without the need for ongoing drugs to prevent rejection.\n\nBlood stem cell transplants are already used to treat cancers of the blood and immune system, including leukemia and lymphoma. However, in cancer care these procedures typically require high doses of chemotherapy and radiation to eliminate the original blood and immune system, which often causes serious side effects. Shizuru and colleagues have designed a safer, less intense way to prepare people with non-cancerous conditions such as Type 1 diabetes for donor blood stem cell transplantation, reducing bone marrow activity just enough to let donor blood stem cells settle in and grow.\n\n\"Based on many years of basic research by us and others, we know that blood stem cell transplants could also be beneficial for a wide range of autoimmune diseases,\" Shizuru said. \"The challenge has been to devise a more benign pre-treatment process, diminishing risk to the point that patients suffering from an autoimmune deficiency that may not be immediately life-threatening would feel comfortable undergoing the treatment.\"\n\n\"Now we know that the donated blood stem cells re-educate the recipient animal's immune system to not only accept the donated islets, but also not attack its healthy tissues, including islets,\" Kim said. \"In turn, the donated blood stem cells and the immune system they produce learn to not attack the recipient's tissues, and graft-versus-host disease can be avoided.\"\n\nFuture hurdles for Type 1 diabetes treatment\n\nAlthough the mouse results are encouraging, significant obstacles remain before this strategy could be widely used to treat Type 1 diabetes. Pancreatic islets can currently be obtained only from deceased donors, and the blood stem cells need to come from the same individual as the islets. It is also uncertain whether the number of islet cells typically recovered from a single donor would always be sufficient to reverse established Type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe scientists are exploring ways to overcome these limitations. Possible solutions include producing large amounts of islet cells in the laboratory from pluripotent human stem cells or developing methods that help transplanted donor islets survive longer and function more efficiently after transplantation.\n\nBeyond diabetes, Kim, Shizuru and their collaborators believe that the gentle pre-conditioning strategy they have developed could open the door to stem cell transplants for other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus and for non-cancerous blood disorders like sickle cell anemia (for which current blood stem cell transplant methods remain harsh), as well as for transplants involving mismatched solid organs.\n\n\"The ability to reset the immune system safely to permit durable organ replacement could rapidly lead to great medical advances,\" Kim said.\n\nThe study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grants T32 GM736543, R01 DK107507, R01 DK108817, U01 DK123743, P30 DK116074 and LAUNCH 1TL1DK139565-0), the Breakthrough T1D Northern California Center of Excellence, Stanford Bio-X, the Reid Family, the H.L.

This causes serious health problems and often requires regular insulin injections.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Stanford University developed a treatment that uses two types of cell transplants in mice. They gave mice blood stem cells and pancreatic islet cells from a donor with a different immune system.

The mice were cured or prevented from getting diabetes without needing immune-suppressing drugs.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because the treatment uses methods already common in hospitals, making human testing possible soon. It also avoids serious side effects seen in other stem cell transplants. The new approach could change how doctors treat not only Type 1 diabetes but also other autoimmune diseases and help improve organ transplants by preventing rejection.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to work on ways to produce enough islet cells in labs and improve how long transplanted cells survive.

      "content": "New tools that create ultra-precise maps of our tissues are transforming our ability to diagnose and cure once-fatal illnesses\n\nAdrià Voltà\n\nThierry Nordmann was on his first night shift as a dermatologist at University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, when he got the emergency call. A patient was being brought in who’d had a severe reaction to their medication, which had destroyed the entire outer layer of their skin. Nordmann’s job was to confirm the diagnosis with a biopsy, but it was already clear: they had lost their skin’s protective barrier, leaving them wide open to infection and dehydration.\n\n“That’s a very bad combination,” he says.\n\nThe medical staff sprang into action, isolating the patient to reduce their risk of infection and giving them antibodies in a bid to halt the immune cascade that was killing their skin cells.\n\nBut it didn’t work. The patient died – as do about a third of people with this painful condition. “The reason was because nobody really understood what was going on,” says Nordmann. “Everybody treats it differently.”\n\nThe experience left him with questions. Why do some people have this intense, lethal reaction to ordinary medicines, while others don’t? What exactly is happening in the cells of their skin?\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Health Check Expert insight and news on scientific developments in health, nutrition and fitness, every Saturday. Sign up to newsletter\n\nFinding answers led Nordmann to a suite of emerging technologies that can study human tissue in astonishing detail, pinpointing diseased cells lying in the three-dimensional structure of our organs.\n\nThese technologies, known as spatial multiomics, are revealing what has gone wrong in the molecular machinery of those cells, and they led Nordmann to develop a new way to address a previously incurable, life-threatening condition. They could also lead to a raft of new treatments for other illnesses, including cancers, and usher in a new age of precision medicine.\n\nPathological skin\n\nModern medicine has spent two centuries zooming in, trying to understand why our bodies sometimes go so badly wrong. We have learned to trace diseases to organs like the heart and lungs, which are made up of tissues, which are made up of cells, which are built using a host of biological molecules like DNA, RNA and proteins.\n\nEach level matters in truly understanding a given condition. Take the heart: cardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating, which seems simple enough, but apprehending why it happens means looking at blood pressure, narrowing of blood vessels, electrical conduction within the heart and many other other processes.\n\nFor Nordmann, the mystery was skin – and what causes it to suddenly, catastrophically, come off.\n\nThe condition Nordmann’s patient had is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). While it is rare, it is also brutal and can begin after taking everyday drugs like certain antibiotics or anti-epilepsy medications. For reasons no one fully understands, the immune system reacts violently. The skin becomes red, blistered and intensely painful. “Just by movement of your thumb on this redness, you can just peel away the skin,” says Nordmann. “Within 48 hours, maybe a bit longer, these patients just shed their skin.”\n\nThe effects are life-threatening. Even if people survive, they are often left with chronic complications.\n\n“But what I’ve been seeing the most in these patients is fear,” says Nordmann. “These patients are scared of every single drug they take.” There is no obvious pattern in the treatments observed to cause TEN. And while some populations are at a substantially elevated risk, including Asian and Black people, “it can happen to almost anybody”, says Nordmann.\n\nToxic epidermal necrolysis can be a side effect of common drugs, like antibiotics and anti-epilepsy medications Cristian Storto/Alamy\n\nHe suspected that the path to a viable treatment, if one existed, lay deep inside the skin. But here he found he was up against a problem that has bedevilled medical researchers for decades: even within a single organ or tissue, not all cells are alike. Two neighbouring cells can behave differently, producing a different mix of proteins and chemical signals. This means that a handful of malfunctioning cells can cause cascading damage to the entire organ.\n\nCancer researchers have known this for years. They talk about the “tumour microenvironment” – the idea that a tumour isn’t uniform, even under a microscope. “What’s going on at the invasive margin or leading edge of the cancer can be different than what’s going on in the central portion of the tumour,” says Frank Sinicrope, an oncology professor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nBut standard lab tools struggle to resolve these cell-to-cell differences. Analyses that sample the proteins or RNA in a tissue will generally mash together hundreds of cells in order to get a large enough sample. The result is a bit like a smoothie, which researchers can use to study thousands of proteins or other molecules.\n\nYet the crucial changes that researchers might still be able to spot are hidden in the mush. The signal is there, but scientists can’t say where it is happening.\n\nThere is another way to study diseased cells: look at them one by one. That became possible in the 2010s, when researchers learned to isolate single cells and sequence their entire genome. “We could identify that there were cell populations that we hadn’t understood before,” says J. Michelle Kahlenberg, a professor of rheumatic diseases at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nBut there was a catch. Such methods strip the cells from their context. Once removed from their tissue, it was impossible to say where each one had come from or how it might have affected its neighbours, and thus how abnormal behaviour spreads.\n\nNow, though, a new generation of tools is bringing that context back.\n\nCell by cell\n\nKnown collectively as spatial multiomics, these techniques build up a three-dimensional map of a tissue or organ. This helps researchers identify diseased or abnormal cells and profile them on a molecular level.\n\n“We’re on the precipice of really understanding biology in a way that will revolutionise our ability to safely treat all sorts of life-threatening illnesses,” says Kahlenberg.\n\nThe term multiomics refers to the practice of studying multiple biological systems at once: genes (via genomics), RNA (via transcriptomics), proteins (via proteomics) and more. Each offers a different lens on how cells function.\n\nSpatial multiomics goes one step further and adds high-resolution imaging to molecular analysis, allowing scientists to build detailed maps of living systems – not just what molecules are present, but where they are and how they interact across space.\n\nAndreas Mund, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, who helped develop the method Nordmann would later use to unpick TEN, calls it deep visual proteomics. Mund’s team described its technique in 2022, and it unfolds in four stages.\n\nIt starts with a biopsy: a sliver of tissue is fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin, then sliced into micrometre-thin sections. These are stained to highlight particular molecules.\n\nThen things get more precise. Mund’s team uses high-resolution microscopes and AI image analysis to create detailed digital maps of the tissues, showing each cell’s boundaries and flagging those that appear abnormal.\n\nScientists are using spatial multiomics to better understand, and hopefully treat, ovarian tumours like the one shown here Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library\n\nA laser dissection microscope then cuts out labelled cells one by one, tracking their position in the original tissue. Each cell is broken apart, its constituent proteins shattered and analysed by mass spectrometry, a method that weighs molecules with incredible precision. “We use the latest and greatest on the market,” says Mund. Their mass spectrometers are so sensitive that they can detect differences equivalent to the weight of a jumbo jet versus a jumbo jet with a fly sitting on it.\n\nThe outcome is a powerful molecular map: a profile of every cell and the proteins it contains. Crucially, it allows researchers to compare healthy and abnormal cells and detect patterns of dysfunction that were previously invisible.\n\nIn a paper released in July, Mund and his colleagues looked at a kind of pancreatic cancer in which tumours form from distinctive lesions within the pancreas, but not all of these lesions go on to be tumours. “Why are these so different? What are the molecular differences?” asks Mund.\n\nTo find out, they analysed over 8000 proteins across cells from five people with this cancer and 10 cancer-free organ donors. Even cells that looked normal under the microscope showed early signs of tumour development in people with cancer: inflammation, metabolic rewiring and other stress markers. “There’s a lot of things already happening under the surface,” says Mund.\n\nHe and his team argue their work could lead to biomarkers for earlier detection, a major step for one of the deadliest cancers.\n\nAnd deep visual proteomics is just one part of this new set of technologies, each aimed at unravelling the spatial story of disease in place, cell by cell.\n\nSpatial multiomics\n\nAnother promising way to track what is happening inside a cell is by looking at its RNA.\n\nRNA plays a key role in gene expression. Genes store instructions in DNA, but to act on them, cells first transcribe that information onto RNA. The resulting RNA then guides protein production, the main outcome of gene expression. By examining which RNA molecules are present in a cell, a profile known as its transcriptome, scientists can get a snapshot of the cell’s condition, including what it is trying to do or cope with at any given time.\n\nSpatial transcriptomics involves mapping the cells in a tissue and then studying their individual transcriptomes. “Spatial transcriptomics, I think, takes us to the next level,” says Kahlenberg.\n\nIn July, researchers led by Ernst Lengyel at the University of Chicago used spatial transcriptomics to develop a potential treatment for ovarian cancer. They focused on a group of cells called cancer-associated fibroblasts, which help tumours grow. These cells were already known to respond to an enzyme called NNMT. Using spatial transcriptomics, they discovered that this response caused fibroblasts to release chemicals that dampened the immune system, shielding the cancer. That insight led the team to create an NNMT inhibitor that, in mice, enabled the immune system to go to work and reduce the growth of tumours.\n\nSurgeons perform laparoscopic surgery on a 58-year-old woman with ovarian cancer Dr P. Marazzi/Science Photo Library\n\nTranscriptomics and proteomics are complementary, says Sinicrope, because they give different kinds of information about the cell. “RNA gives us more in terms of the pathways and the signatures.”\n\nNow, some researchers are trying to combine the two to get an even more multilayered picture of what is happening in diseased tissue. In August, Lengyel and his colleagues used spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to map out changes in ovarian tumours, leading them to identify 16 potential drug targets – two of which have since showed promise in mice.\n\nMeanwhile, halfway across the world at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Nordmann was using spatial proteomics to crack the TEN mystery.\n\nNew treatments\n\nNordmann arrived in Martinsried, Germany, from his position in Switzerland, armed with Mund’s new approach of studying diseases and a drawer full of skin samples from people with TEN. Having followed Mund’s team’s work on ovarian cancer, he and his colleagues sought to understand the underlying mechanisms that cause skin to detach in TEN.\n\nThe deep visual proteomics revealed a striking pattern. In the immune cells of the TEN patients, a molecular system called the interferon pathway was massively overactive. “I have really never seen such a clear picture in my life,” says Nordmann.\n\nNormally, interferons are produced by cells in response to viral infection. They prompt other cells to activate their antiviral defences. But in Nordmann’s TEN patients, there was no virus: the interferon response was a mistake and was causing the immune system to destroy the outer layer of their skin.\n\nA micrograph showing the top layer of skin starting to detach in someone with toxic epidermal necrolysis Biophoto Associates/Science Photo Library\n\nThe team discovered that a signalling pathway called JAK/STAT was driving the cells to produce interferons.\n\nExcitingly, drugs already exist that block this signalling pathway, as it is implicated in other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis, so they could work for TEN too. “The cool thing is, there are already inhibitors out there,” says Nordmann.\n\nWith the help of Chao Ji at Fujian Medical University in Fuzhou, China, Nordmann launched the first human trial in 2023. They treated seven TEN patients, all of whom were still alive with no side effects 30 days later, the duration of the study. One man who had lost 35 per cent of his outer skin grew almost all of it back within 16 days; the treatment halted cell death in all patients and promoted a regrowth of skin.\n\nThough it wasn’t a controlled study, because the team didn’t want to give some TEN patients a placebo, Nordmann is now trying to get a pharmaceutical company to set up a full clinical trial.\n\nFor the first time, TEN had been effectively treated. Nordmann and his colleagues’ work is a dramatic illustration of the potential of spatial multiomics. It’s a huge leap forward from where doctors were just a few years ago, when they were forced to treat TEN patients essentially as severe burn victims: giving them fluids, anti-inflammatories and something for the pain.\n\n“My personal opinion is, in two to three years’ time, this will be the standard treatment for this disease,” says Nordmann.\n\nIt will take a while before spatial multiomics technologies are used widely in research and in clinics. Running a few hundred samples through spatial multiomics can cost millions of dollars. But some hospitals are already placing big bets on this new approach.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic has established a Spatial Multiomics Core to perform such analyses. The researchers there hope to better understand atherosclerotic plaques, which are a major element of heart disease, by figuring out what their many component cells are doing.\n\nSimilarly, diabetes can cause complications in the gut by affecting the cells of the gut lining, so identifying the cells most prone to such damage would be a key step in preventing it.\n\nAnd for his part, Sinicrope, who leads the Spatial Multiomics Core, is optimistic that spatial multiomics will help with cancer, especially solid tumours.\n\nMeanwhile, Mund and his colleagues founded a company called OmicVision in 2023 off the back of their deep visual proteomics technique, with the aim of reducing how laborious and complex it is to carry out. With improved AI image analysis, Mund hopes to drive the cost of deep visual proteomics down and make the technology more widely available. “Our mission is really to move the needle,” he says.\n\nFive years since he started working with spatial multiomics, Nordmann remains thrilled by its potential. “You get an entire new picture, an entire new understanding of the molecular information within a tissue,” he says. “It gives us new ideas of how to diagnose them, understand them, treat them.”",

Contrairement aux méthodes anciennes qui étudiaient plusieurs cellules en même temps, cette approche révèle la localisation exacte et le rôle de chaque cellule, rendant les traitements plus précis.\n\n**Prochaine étape**\nLes chercheurs veulent lancer de plus grands essais cliniques pour confirmer le succès du traitement. Par ailleurs, des hôpitaux comme la Mayo Clinic adoptent la multiomique spatiale pour étudier d’autres maladies comme les maladies cardiaques et le diabète. Les scientifiques travaillent aussi à réduire les coûts et à simplifier la technologie pour qu’elle soit utilisée plus largement.\n\n**En une phrase**\nUne nouvelle technologie de cartographie cellulaire a permis un traitement prometteur d’une maladie de peau mortelle et pourrait transformer la compréhension et le traitement de nombreuses maladies.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto**\nLos médicos han tenido dificultades durante años para entender la necrolisis epidérmica tóxica (TEN), una enfermedad rara pero mortal de la piel donde los pacientes pierden la capa exterior de la piel, a menudo después de tomar medicamentos comunes. Esto los deja vulnerables a infecciones y deshidratación, y muchos mueren porque no se entendía bien la enfermedad.\n\n**Qué pasó**\nCientíficos usaron un nuevo método llamado multiómica espacial para estudiar la TEN en detalle. Esta tecnología mapea las células en los tejidos y analiza sus moléculas una por una, mostrando exactamente cómo se comportan e interactúan las células. Con este método, un equipo liderado por el dermatólogo Thierry Nordmann descubrió que en TEN, las células inmunes atacan la piel por error debido a un sistema de interferón demasiado activo. Probaron un medicamento que bloquea esta reacción en siete pacientes, y todos sobrevivieron sin efectos secundarios. Un paciente recuperó la mayor parte de su piel perdida en solo 16 días.\n\n**Impacto**\nEsta es la primera vez que TEN se trata con éxito gracias a una comprensión clara de su causa. La nueva tecnología de multiómica espacial no solo ayudó a resolver un misterio médico, sino que también abrió la puerta a mejores tratamientos para TEN y otras enfermedades como el cáncer. A diferencia de métodos antiguos que analizaban muchas células juntas, este enfoque revela la ubicación exacta y el papel de cada célula, haciendo los tratamientos más precisos.\n\n**Próximo paso**\nLos investigadores quieren comenzar ensayos clínicos más grandes para confirmar el éxito del tratamiento. Mientras tanto, hospitales como la Clínica Mayo están adoptando la multiómica espacial para estudiar otras enfermedades como las del corazón y la diabetes. Los científicos también trabajan para reducir costos y simplificar la tecnología para que se use más ampliamente.\n\n**Una frase clave**\nUna nueva tecnología para mapear células ha llevado a un tratamiento prometedor para una enfermedad de piel mortal y podría transformar la forma en que los médicos entienden y curan muchas enfermedades.",

      "content": "Mouse procedures\n\nNPp53 mice were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6-129Sv background and have been previously described7. Tamoxifen induction was performed in mice at 3–5 months of age by oral delivery of tamoxifen (MilliporeSigma; 100 mg kg–1 day–1 in corn oil) for 4 consecutive days as previously described58. The survival time of tumour-bearing mice in this study ranged from 228 to 435 days after tamoxifen induction (Supplementary Table 1). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated autoclaved cages with irradiated feed and automated reverse-osmosis watering, under a 12-h dark–12-h light cycle with temperatures at 20–26 °C and humidity between 30 and 70%. All procedures followed protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\nEstablishment and maintenance of mouse prostate organoids\n\nTumour tissues from NPp53 mice were cut into two pieces, with half fixed in 10% formalin for paraffin embedding and the other half used for organoid establishment. Tissues were minced with scissors in 0.2% collagenase IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17104019) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by neutralization with 1:10 Hank’s buffer (Stemcell Technologies, 37150) supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 (Stemcell Technologies) and 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (CS-FBS; Gemini, 100-119). After centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, pellets were incubated with prewarmed TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12605010) at 37 °C for 10 min. The cell suspension was then neutralized 1:10 with PBS, passed through a 100-µm cell strainer (Corning, 352360) and spun down at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. Before plating, cell numbers were counted in a TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad).\n\nCells were resuspended in organoid culture medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632, 10 µM A83-01 (Tocris 2939) and 5% Matrigel (Corning 354234) and plated at a seeding density of approximately 50,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates (Corning 3474). Organoid culture medium consisted of hepatocyte culture medium (Corning, 355056), 5% CS-FBS, 1× GlutaMAX supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050061), 5 ng ml–1 EGF, 100 µg ml–1 primocin (Invivogen, ant-pm-1) and 100 nM DHT, as previously described59. For heterogeneous neuroendocrine organoids, such as NPPO-1 and NPPO-5, organoid culture medium was replaced every 4 days. For maintenance of homogeneous neuroendocrine organoids, such as NPPO-1NE, NPPO-2, NPPO-4 and NPPO-6, we used neuroendocrine organoid culture medium, which was identical to the organoid culture medium except that no EGF was added; the medium was replaced every 4 days. For maintenance of non-neuroendocrine NPPO organoids (NPPO-1nonNE, NPPO-7, NPPO8 and NPPO9), we used the standard organoid culture medium. In organoid experiments involving CRISPR–Cas9-mediated targeting of Nsd2, oncohistone H3.3K36M expression or NSD2i treatment, DHT was removed from the culture medium starting at day 0, and organoids were maintained in the absence of DHT for subsequent analyses.\n\nFor passaging, organoids were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 1 min, followed by the addition of 1 ml pre-warmed TrypLE for 10 min at 37 °C for cell dissociation. After neutralization with 10 ml PBS, cells were spun down and counted, with approximately 50,000 cells plated per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates (Corning, 3474). To generate cryopreserved stocks, organoids were frozen in 90% CS-FBS and 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen. We considered neuroendocrine organoid lines to be successfully established when they could be stably passaged, cryopreserved and recovered without loss of neuroendocrine phenotypes. Details regarding establishment of the TKO organoids (Extended Data Fig. 4a) from Ptenfl/fl;Rb1fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl;mT:mG (PtRP) prostate epithelial cells are described in a separate manuscript (in preparation). Organoid cultures routinely tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.\n\nHuman prostate tumour organoids\n\nMSKPCa2, MSKPCa10, MSKPCa14, WCM154 and WCM1262 organoids have been previously described5,36,37. Human prostate tumour organoids were maintained in 80% Matrigel in human neuroendocrine culture medium, which was replaced every other day. Human neuroendocrine culture medium consisted of human hepatocyte culture medium (LifeNet Health LifeSciences, MED-HHCM-500ML), human hepatocyte culture medium supplement (LifeNet Health LifeSciences, MED-HHCMS), 5% CS-FBS, 1× GlutaMAX, 5 ng ml–1 EGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PHG0311), 100 µg ml–1 primocin and 10 nM DHT.\n\nH&E staining\n\nFor tissue processing and embedding, organoids were fixed in 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-4) for 1 h, washed once with PBS, placed in rat tail collagen I (Corning, 354249) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The collagen button was then put into a biopsy cassette (Fisher Scientific, 15182705E) and fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h. After replacing the formalin with 70% ethanol, the cassettes were put into an automated tissue processor for tissue processing and embedding.\n\nParaffin-embedded blocks were sectioned into 5-µm sections using a microtome and dried onto microscope slides at room temperature. Paraffin sections were baked at 65 °C for 15 min before deparaffinization with 3 changes of xylene (5 min each). The slides were hydrated through 100%, 95% and 95% ethanol, 5 min each, rinsed in tap water for 2 min and incubated in Gill Hematoxylin 3 (Epredia, 72611) for 3–30 min. Slides were rinsed in tap water and dipped 3–5 times in 0.5% acid alcohol (Leica Biosystems, 3803651), followed by rinsing in tap water and bluing with Scott’s Tap Water (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 2607007) for 5 min. After rinsing in tap water, slides were incubated in 95% ethanol for 5 min and counterstained with eosin (StatLab, S1761GL) for 1–3 min. Slides were passed through 70%, 95% and 100% (3 times) ethanol, rinsed 3 times in xylene and coverslipped with mounting medium (StatLab, MMC0126). Images were captured using an Olympus BX 61 VS slide scanner, and image acquisition was performed using Olympus VS-ASW (v.2.5) software.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining\n\nParaffin sections (5 µm) were dried onto microscope slides at room temperature, incubated at 65 °C for 15 min before deparaffinization through 3 changes of xylene (5 min each), hydrated in 100%, 95%, 95% and 75% ethanol (5 min each) and washed in tap water for 2 min. Antigen retrieval was performed through immersion in boiling citrate buffer (pH 6) for 10 min, cooling to room temperature for 30 min and incubation in Milli-Q water at room temperature for 10 min. Sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (MilliporeSigma, 11332481001) for 10 min and blocked in 10% goat serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50062Z) for 1 h. Primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions (Supplementary Table 6) were added to sections and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed with PBS 3 times, 15 min each, and incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS 3 times, 15 min each, nuclei were stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific D1306) for 5 min. Slides were washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield Antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories H-1200-10). Images were captured using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (LAS AF v.2.6.0) software.\n\nscRNA-seq\n\nFor scRNA-seq, NPPO-1, NPPO-2, NPPO-4, NPPO-5 and NPPO-6 organoids were analysed at passage 2. Organoids were dissociated by incubation with pre-warmed TrypLE at 37 °C for 10 min, neutralization with 1:10 5% CS-FBS–PBS, centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 1 min and filtration 3 times through a 40-µm cell strainer (Corning 431750). Cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, pellets were dissociated with 5% CS-FBS–PBS and resuspended at 1,000 cells per µl after counting using a Countess II FL automated cell counter. Libraries were prepared using a Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent kit (v3.1) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Approximately 5,000 cells were loaded onto a Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) to generate gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs), and barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA was generated and amplified by PCR. Chromium Gene Expression libraries were prepared for paired-end sequencing, and scRNA-seq data were processed using Cell Ranger software (10x Genomics, v.2.1.1 for MJ002 and MJ004; v.3.0.2 for MJ005, MJ007, MJ008 and MJ012; v.5.0.1 for MJ014 and MJ015; see Supplementary Table 3 for sample identities) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Quality control metrics are provided in Supplementary Table 7.\n\nSingle-nucleus ATAC–seq\n\nNPPO-1 organoids at passage 8 were dissociated using TrypLE, passed through a 40-µm cell strainer 3 times, and cell numbers quantified using an automated cell counter. Approximately 1 × 106 cells in 0.04% BSA–PBS (Miltenyi Biotec 130-091-376) were used for single nucleus isolation. Cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, dissociated for 5 min with 100 µl ice-cold lysis buffer, neutralized with 1 ml chilled wash buffer, spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in chilled nuclei buffer included in a Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library kit (10x Genomics). Wash buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1% BAS and 0.1% Tween-20 in nuclease-free water. Lysis buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 substitute, 0.01% digitonin and 1% BAS in nuclease-free water. Nucleus concentration was determined using a Countess II FL automated cell counter. Approximately 5,000 nuclei were loaded onto a Chromium Controller at the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Single-nucleus ATAC–seq libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits v.1.1, 10X Genomics). In brief, nuclei were transposed and partitioned into GEMs. 10x barcodes were added to index the transposed DNA of each individual nucleus. Libraries were generated by PCR and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 platform. Paired-end sequencing data were processed with Cell Ranger ATAC (v.1.0.1) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Quality control metrics are provided in Supplementary Table 7.\n\nIsolation of neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cells from NPPO-1 organoids\n\nTo sort neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine populations, NPPO-1 organoids at passage 2 were incubated with prewarmed TrypLE at 37 °C for 10 min, neutralized with 1:10 PBS and 5% CS-FBS, spun at 1,000 rpm for 1 min, resuspended with PBS and dissociated into single cells by gentle pipetting. The cells were filtered 3 times through a 40-µm cell strainer (Corning, 431750), spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended with PBS and 2% CS-FBS. After filtering through a Falcon tube with a 35-µm strainer cap (Corning 352235), cell numbers were counted in a TC20 automated cell counter, and the volume was adjusted to a final cell concentration of 5,000 cells per µl.\n\nFlow sorting was performed on an BD Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences, X64650000124) at the Flow Cytometry Core of the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology. Gating by forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) was used to exclude debris, and doublets were excluded by gating on trigger pulse width against FSC height. Individual neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine tumour cells were sorted based on scatter parameters. Neuroendocrine tumour cells have less internal complexity (granularity) than non-neuroendocrine tumour cells and exhibit lower intensity SSC. Flow sorting data were collected and analysed using BD FACS software (BD Biosciences, v.1.2.0.142). Cell purity was assessed after flow sorting by scRNA-seq.\n\nLineage tracing in organoids\n\nFlow-sorted neuroendocrine cells from NPPO-1 organoids were maintained in neuroendocrine organoid culture medium with 5% Matrigel. Half of the flow-sorted non-neuroendocrine cells were used for scRNA-seq (Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core) immediately after sorting. The other non-neuroendocrine cells were transfected with H2B-RFP (Addgene, 26001) lentivirus. Approximately 70% of non-neuroendocrine cells were labelled with H2B-RFP at 3 days after transfection, in the absence of antibiotic selection. On day 7, the cells were digested with TrypLE and passed 3 times through a 40-µm cell strainer to ensure a single-cell suspension, followed by cell counting. For co-culture, H2B-RFP-labelled non-neuroendocrine cells were seeded together with neuroendocrine cells at a ratio of 2:3 in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates; as a control, H2B-RFP-labelled non-neuroendocrine cells were seeded alone. The resulting organoids were cultured in organoid culture medium with 5% Matrigel and analysed at passage 4 by immunostaining and scRNA-seq.\n\nImaging of histone and DNA modifications\n\nTo screen for differential expression of histone modifications between neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine tumour cells in NPPO-1 organoids, we performed immunofluorescence staining with antibodies that detect the neuroendocrine markers SYP or CHGA, the non-neuroendocrine marker VIM, and various histone and DNA modifications (Supplementary Table 6). Images were captured using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope, and images were acquired using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software (LAS AF v.2.6.0). Fluorescence intensity was measured using ImageJ (NIH; v.1.52K) using three parameters: area, integrated density (IntDen) and mean grey value. The background was measured from a region that had no fluorescence on the same image. Intensity was calculated using the formula: Intensity = IntDen – (area \\(\\times \\) mean fluorescence of background readings). Measurements were collected from three independent organoids, and results were plotted using Prism 9 (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). Unpaired t-tests were used to compare means, and P values were calculated from two-tailed t-tests.\n\nAnalysis of NSD2 expression in human datasets\n\nTo evaluate differences in gene expression of NSD1, NSD2 and NSD3 in human prostate tumour samples, we analysed bulk RNA-seq from 49 patients with CRPC (15 CRPC-NE and 34 CRPC-Adeno) from a published dataset20. For each gene, P values were calculated using two-tailed t-tests comparing the mean log-transformed counts per million (CPM) between the CRPC-NE and CRPC-Adeno groups.\n\nWe also analysed a published scRNA-seq dataset25. Expression data from tumour cells were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO accession GSE264573) and supplementary file ‘msk.integrated.remove.cellcycle.tumor.cells’. We used the same annotation for NEPC, CRPC and treatment-naive/CSPC, as released in supplementary file ‘pnas.2322203121.sd03.xlsx’. Violin plots were generated using the seaborn Python library. For each gene, violin plots were created to visualize the distribution of gene expression across three subtypes. Group means were overlaid as horizontal lines to aid visual interpretation. Pairwise statistical comparisons between subtypes were performed using nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-tests (two-sided), implemented using the statannotations package.\n\nHistone extraction and western blotting\n\nHistone extract lysates were prepared by acid extraction as previously described60. In brief, cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 and protease inhibitor cocktail (MilliporeSigma, 11697498001)) and incubated on a rotator for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in H 2 SO 4 . After overnight incubation on a rotator at 4 °C, debris was removed by centrifugation (16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C) and histones were precipitated from the supernatant using TCA (MilliporeSigma, T6399). Purified histones were washed with cold acetone and resuspended in H 2 O. Samples were quantified using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, 5000205), and protein lysates were prepared using SDS lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, LC2676).\n\nFor western blotting, whole-cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in SDS lysis buffer, sonicating for 10 s twice and boiling for 8 min. Protein lysates were resolved on 3–8% (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EA0375BOX) or 4–12% gradient SDS–PAGE gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0321BOX), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in 5% non-fat milk in PBS plus 0.5% Tween-20, probed with primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions (Supplementary Table 6) and detected with horseradish-peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, 7074) or anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, 7076). Blots were imaged using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad, 17001402) or exposed to X-ray film (Research Products International, 248300). For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.\n\nBulk RNA-seq\n\nOrganoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE, and total RNA was isolated using a MagMAX-96 for Microarrays Total RNA Isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM1839). In brief, cells were lysed in 1 ml TRI reagent per 5 million cells and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The homogenate was mixed with 0.1 volume 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (MilliporeSigma, B9673), incubated at room temperature for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Next, 100 μl of the aqueous phase was transferred to an 8-strip EpiCypher tube (DNase/RNase-free), and 50 μl of 100% isopropanol (MilliporeSigma I9516) was added with shaking for 1 min. Next, 10 μl RNA binding beads was added, followed by shaking for 3 min. The RNA binding beads were then captured on a magnetic stand and the beads were washed twice with 150 μl wash solution. The beads were dried for 2 min, and RNA was eluted in 50 μl elution buffer. All samples were DNase-treated before library construction. Quality assessment was performed using a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent), with a median RNA integrity number of 9.2 (range of 8.7–9.8). Libraries were generated using the Illumina Stranded mRNA Prep, and 150-bp paired-end sequencing was performed to a minimum of 20 million reads per sample on an Illumina HiSeq platform.\n\nCUT&Tag\n\nBefore cell preparation, 10 µl per sample concanavalin A (ConA)-coated magnetic beads (Bangs Laboratories BP531) was transferred into a 1.5-ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf 022431021) and mixed by gentle vortexing with 0.4 ml binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15630080), 10 mM KCl (MilliporeSigma, 60142), 1 mM CaCl 2 (MilliporeSigma, 21115) and 1 mM MnCl 2 (MilliporeSigma M1787) in nuclease-free water). The tubes were placed on a magnetic stand (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12321D) to clear and remove liquid, with the wash repeated once with binding buffer.\n\nFor experiments requiring normalization of input DNA, 10,000 Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R69007) were combined with 200,000 experimental cells at a ratio of 1:20. S2 cells were maintained in Schneider’s Drosophila medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21720024), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gemini, 100-106) and 100 µg ml–1 primocin. S2 cells were plated in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates at a seeding density of approximately 100,000 cells per well and maintained at 28 °C without CO 2 .\n\nOrganoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE, counted using a TC20 automated cell counter, and 200,000 cells per sample were used for profiling. After centrifugation at 1,000 rpm at room temperature, cell pellets were washed once with 1 ml wash buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine (MilliporeSigma, S2501) and cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (MilliporeSigma, 11873580001) in nuclease-free water). Cell pellets were resuspended with 10 µl ConA beads in 0.4 ml wash buffer and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The tubes were then placed on a magnetic stand (New England Biolabs, S1515S) to clear and remove the liquid, with pellets resuspended with 50 µl ice-cold Dig-wash buffer (wash buffer with 0.05% digitonin) and placed on ice for 10 min to lyse the cells. The samples were then transferred to an 8-strip tube (EpiCypher, 10-0009). Each sample was incubated with 0.5 µg primary or IgG control antibody (Supplementary Table 6) and placed on a nutator at 4 °C overnight. The next day, samples were incubated with 1 µl secondary antibody in 50 µl ice-cold Dig-wash buffer on a nutator at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with Dig-Wash buffer 3 times, beads were resuspended with 50 µl Dig-300 buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.01% digitonin, cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail in nuclease-free water) containing 2.5 µl pA-Tn5 adapter complex (EpiCypher, 15-1017) and placed on a nutator at room temperature for 1 h. After washing 3 times with Dig-300 buffer, the beads were resuspended in 150 µl Tagmentation buffer (Dig-300 buffer with 10 mM MgCl 2 ) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h.\n\nTo stop tagmentation and to solubilize DNA fragments, 5 µl 0.5 M EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9260G), 1.5 µl 10% SDS (MilliporeSigma, 71736) and 1.25 µl 20 mg ml–1 proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EO0491) was added to each sample and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The next day, phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15593049) was used to extract nucleic acids. DNA was precipitated with 100% ethanol (MilliporeSigma, E7023) and dissolved in 25 μl RNase-free water. To remove RNA contamination before library preparation, DNA samples were incubated with 25 µg ml–1 RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EN0531) at 37 °C for 10 min. Library DNAs were amplified by PCR using Illumina universal i5 primers, Nextera barcoded i7 primers (Supplementary Table 8) and NEBNext HiFi 2× PCR master mix (New England Biolabs, M0541). The PCR conditions were as follows: cycle 1: 72 °C for 5 min; cycle 2: 98 °C for 30 s; cycle 3: 98 °C for 10 s; cycle 4: 63 °C for 10 s, repeating 14 times, followed by 72 °C for 1 min and hold at 8 °C. Post-PCR clean-up was performed using 1:1 volume Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63880). Samples were dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8; MilliporeSigma, T2694) for sequencing. Size distribution and concentration of libraries were determined by capillary electrophoresis using a 4200 TapeStation (Agilent). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) was performed on pooled libraries, with 10–12 million reads per library, using an Illumina HiSeq system. Quality control metrics are provided in Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 2.\n\nCUT&Tag data analysis\n\nCUT&Tag reads were trimmed using cutadapt (v.3.6) and aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) and Drosophila (BDGP6) using BOWTIE2 (v.2.4.2) with the following options: --very-sensitive-local --no-unal --no-mixed --no-discordant --phred33 -I 10 -X 700. Scaling factors for spike-in normalization were determined by the ratio between the number of reads aligned to the mouse genome and the Drosophila genome. Potential PCR duplicates were removed by the markdup function of sambamba (v.1.0.1). Peak calling was performed using SEACR (v.1.3) or MACS2 (v.2.2.8) with IgG input as control. Intersect function of bedtools (v.2.27.1) was used to identify H3K27ac enhancers corresponding to H3K27ac peaks not overlapping promoters and found in broader H3K36me2 domains. Motif analysis was performed using the simple enrichment analysis function from MEME suit (v.5.5.7) with the JASPAR 2022 Core motif database61. Genomic enrichment of CUT&Tag signals for each histone modification was analysed using deeptools (v.3.5.5) and visualized using IGV (v.2.13.0). Coverage tracks were generated using the bamCoverage function of DeepTools with the bin size of 50 bp, with problematic ENCODE regions (the ENCODE blacklist for mm1062) and amplified genomic regions blacklisted and normalized using the appropriate scaling factor (mapped Drosophila reads). Heatmap and enrichment plots of H3K36me2, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 or H3K27ac over H3K36me2 or H3K27ac peaks were generated using the computeMatrix (reference- point, - a 5000 - b 5000) and plotHeatmap functions implemented in DeepTools.\n\nRNA-seq reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using HISAT2 (v.2.1.0). The mapped reads count of each gene was measured by featureCounts (v.1.6.1). The RNA-seq read count matrix was combined with the CUT&Tag signal read count matrix for all gene loci in R (v.4.1.2).\n\nLentivirus production and transfection\n\nLentiviruses were generated by the transfection of 293T cells with the indicated expression plasmid and the psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and pVSV.G (Addgene, 14888) packaging vectors at a ratio of 4:2:3, respectively. Viral supernatants were collected at 48, 72 and 96 h after transfection, filtered and concentrated using a Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara Bio, 631232). For CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene knockout, we used the lentiCas9-blast plasmid (Addgene, 52962) and a custom vector for sgRNA (U6-sgRNA-EFS-Puro-P2A-TurboRFP in a pLL3-based lentiviral backbone; gift from S. Lowe). For sgRNA design, the CRISPick platform (BROAD institute) was used. HA-tagged H3.3K36M was overexpressed in the pCDH vector (gift from D. Allis). The following sgRNAs were used in the experiment: sgControl, 5′ GAG ATA AGC ATT ATA ATT CCT 3′; sgNsd2 (mouse): 5′ TCA GGG TCT CAC AAT TGG GC 3′; sgNSD2 (human): 5′ GCA CCA GCT CAC GTT GAC GT 3′.\n\nFor transfection, organoids were incubated with high-titre lentivirus in culture medium supplemented with 8 µg ml–1 polybrene (MilliporeSigma, TR-1003). Medium containing virus was removed on the next day and switched to normal organoid medium with Matrigel. Selection with appropriate antibiotics was performed at 3 days after transfection for 7–14 days.\n\nMultiplexed staining of TMAs\n\nPrimary antibodies were tested on prostate tumour samples to verify the expected pattern of staining and were titrated at four concentrations to determine the best signal-to-noise ratio. Multiplexed staining was performed using an Opal 6-plex detection kit (Akoya Biosciences, NEL871001KT) on a Bond Rx Research Stainer (Leica Biosystems), adding DAPI as a nuclear marker. Slides were imaged using a Vectra Polaris Automated Quantitative Pathology Multispectral Imaging system (Akoya Biosciences). Exposure times were optimized under the constraint that no pixel saturated the detector. These studies were conducted under protocols approved by Weill Cornell Medical Center. All patients with prostate cancer or their families provided informed consent for research use of biospecimens and clinical data under an institutional approved protocol (IRB #1008011210).\n\nAnalysis of patient survival curves\n\nTo evaluate the association of NSD2 with overall survival in mCRPC, two independent mCRPC biopsy RNA-seq cohorts were used: (1) a cohort of 159 mCRPC transcriptomes generated by the PCF–SU2C Prostate Cancer Dream Team13 (141 mCRPC transcriptomes from this dataset were used for the survival analyses as survival data were not available for 18 patients); (2) a cohort of 95 mCRPC transcriptomes from patients treated at the RMH31 were analysed (94 mCRPC transcriptomes were used for the survival analyses as survival data were not available for 1 patient). Transcriptomes were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) using TopHat2 (v.2.0.7). Gene expression as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) was calculated using Cufflinks (v.2.2.1). Kaplan–Meier studies evaluated overall survival outcomes. To examine the correlation of NSD2 expression with neuroendocrine gene expression, a 29 gene neuroendocrine signature20 was used to calculate an accumulated signature score for each sample by summing the z score of the signature genes.\n\nComputational analysis of multiplex images\n\nAll TMA cores underwent post-acquisition processing by linear spectral unmixing and deconvolved using InForm software (Akoya Biosciences, v.3.1), and the tiles were stitched using Halo (Indica Labs, v.3.6). Tissue segmentation of the images was performed using a deep-learning classifier by training the algorithm ‘DenseNet V2’ from the Halo AI plug-in (Indica Labs, v.3.6), using only the DAPI channel as information for the training. Eight different classes were defined for both tissue segmentation and quality control issues: background, stroma, malignant tumour, benign glands, necrosis, liver tissue, decalcified tissue and out-of-focus regions. The performance of the classifier was evaluated by a pathologist (F.S.) to ensure that the majority of tissue compartments were properly classified. Cell segmentation was performed using a pre-trained deep-learning model already present in Halo AI (‘nuclei seg’) and applied to the DAPI channel only. Using the module ‘analysis’ in the Halo software, all the biomarkers were then quantified using the segmentation algorithms to generate a counts matrix representing the average expression of each marker in each cell. Thresholding for each marker was performed using a Gaussian mixture model of statistically robust cut-off values for low versus high intensity of the markers.\n\nThe x and y coordinates for the precise nuclei or cytoplasmic marker locations from the immunofluorescence intensities were mapped for each TMA core. The coordinate point location was taken for multiple-localization analysis in different classes of markers. There are Mn classes of markers, for which each class is composed of a different combination of markers. For any given combination of markers, M1, …, Mn (each composed of nuclei or cytoplasm as detected with thresholds on their intensities), we classified a given nucleus or cytoplasm NCi coordinate, k in [1, …, i], belonging to M1, …, Mn class. We repeated this process for each NCi in M1, …, Mn to form a distribution of multiple localizations in the different classes of markers, Ci. Measures for Ci were recorded for each TMA core sample and normalized using the total number of NCi belonging to M1, …, Mn class per patient. For any given marker, M1, …, Mn, we also measured the overall distribution at the single-localization level. The mean value for the measures was implemented by Welch ANOVA or unpaired t-test (two-tailed) in Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0).\n\nFlow sorting of transfected cells\n\nFor CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene knockout experiments, organoids were transfected with the lentiCas9-blast plasmid and blasticidin selection to establish stable lines. A custom vector for the sgRNA lentivirus carrying a TurboRFP reporter and puromycin antibiotic was then transfected into the Cas9-expressing organoids. After 14 days of antibiotic selection, we performed FACS on the PE channel to sort RFP+ cells on an BD Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences, X64650000124), as described above. Approximately 1 × 106 RFP+ cells were collected in 0.04% BSA in PBS (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-376) for single-nucleus isolation and multiome ATAC–seq (10x Genomics). Additional collected RFP+ cells were used for organoid culture.\n\nFor experiments in which mouse neuroendocrine tumour organoids were transfected with an HA-tagged H3.3K36M lentiviral vector, we performed flow cytometry at 14 days after antibiotic selection to determine the purity of the culture. Organoids were dissociated into single cells and resuspended in 100 µl 4% paraformaldehyde (1 × 106 cells) to fix for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were neutralized with 1 ml PBS, washed once with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS. The cells were permeabilized for 10 min by the addition of 0.5 ml 1% Triton-X100 with gentle vortexing to a final concentration of 0.5% Triton-X100. Cells were washed in 10 ml PBS and resuspended with 100 µl Cy5.5-conjugated mouse anti-HA-Tag antibody (clone 6E2, Cell Signaling Technology, 62145) diluted 1:50 in 0.5% BSA in PBS. Cells were incubated with antibody for 1 h in the dark at room temperature, washed twice in 0.5% BSA, resuspended in 300 µl 0.5% BSA and filtered through a Falcon tube with a 35-µm cell strainer cap. Flow cytometry was performed on the APC channel using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) as described above, using Cy5.5+ events to determine the percentage of HA-Tag+ cells. Flow data were analysed using FlowJo (BD, v.10.8.2). The same batch of cells was collected in 0.04% BSA in PBS for single-nucleus isolation and multiome single-nucleus ATAC–seq and snRNA-seq.\n\nSingle-nucleus multiome ATAC–seq and RNA-seq\n\nOrganoids were digested into single cells using TrypLE, passed through a 40-µm cell strainer 3 times, and cell numbers were quantified using an automated cell counter. Approximately 1 × 106 cells in 0.04% BSA–PBS (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-376) were used for single-nucleus isolation. Cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, dissociated for 5 min with 100 µl ice-cold lysis buffer, neutralized with 1 ml wash buffer, spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in chilled nuclei buffer included in the Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit (10x Genomics). Wash buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1% BAS, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT (MilliporeSigma, 646563) and 1 U µl–1 RNase inhibitor (MilliporeSigma, 3335399001) in nuclease-free water. Lysis buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1% BAS, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 substitute, 0.01% digitonin and 1 mM DTT, 1 U µl–1 RNase inhibitor in nuclease-free water. Nucleus concentration was determined using a Countess II FL Automated cell counter.\n\nApproximately 5,000 nuclei were loaded onto a Chromium X Controller (10x Genomics) at the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Single-cell multiome ATAC–seq and RNA-seq libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome Reagent kit, 10x Genomics). In brief, nucleus suspensions were transposed and adapters added to the ends of the DNA fragments. Single Cell Multiome ATAC + GEX Gel Beads include a poly(dT) sequence that enables production of barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA for the gene expression (GEX) library and a spacer sequence that enables barcode attachment to transposed DNA fragments for the ATAC library. The GEMs were generated by combining barcoded gel beads, transposed nuclei and a master mix. Barcoded transposed DNA and barcoded full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA were amplified by PCR. Single-cell multiome ATAC–seq and RNA-seq libraries were prepared for paired-end sequencing, and data were processed using Cell Ranger ARC (10x Genomics, v.1.0.0 for MJ018, MJ019, MJ020, MJ021, MJ022 and MJ023; v.2.0.2 for MJ024 and MJ025; see Supplementary Table 3 for sample identities) by the Columbia University Single Cell Analysis Core. Quality control metrics are provided in Supplementary Table 7.\n\nEnzalutamide treatment of organoids\n\nTo generate drug–response curves, organoids were digested with TrypLE for 10 min at 37 °C, neutralized with PBS, gently dissociated into single cells and passed through a 100-µm cell strainer. Cells were resuspended in 5% Matrigel in neuroendocrine organoid culture medium lacking DHT and plated in triplicate at a seeding density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates. The next day, 7 doses of enzalutamide in 0.1% DMSO were dispensed at 1.5-fold dilution from 1 µM to 11.25 µM. Cell viability was assayed after 5 days using CellTiter-Glo 3D (Promega G9683), and luminescence was measured using a GloMax Explorer multimode plate reader (Promega, v.3.1.0). Background luminescence was measured in medium without cells. The percentage of viable cells was calculated using the following formula:\n\n$${\\rm{V}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{b}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{e}}\\,{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{s}}\\,({\\rm{ \\% }})=\\frac{{\\rm{E}}{\\rm{x}}{\\rm{p}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{m}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{l}}\\,{\\rm{v}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{e}}-{\\rm{b}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{k}}{\\rm{g}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{d}}\\,{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{d}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{g}}}{{\\rm{V}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{h}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{e}}\\,{\\rm{v}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{e}}-{\\rm{b}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{c}}{\\rm{k}}{\\rm{g}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{d}}\\,{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{d}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{g}}}\\times 100$$\n\nDrug–response curves were generated by nonlinear regression using the percentage of viable cells against the logarithm of drug concentrations using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). IC 50 values were calculated by the equation log (inhibitor) versus response (variable slope, four parameters). Two-way ANOVA was used to compare dose–response curves.\n\nSimilar methods were used to determine response of mouse or human organoids to defined doses of enzalutamide, using 5,000 cells per well (mouse) or 10,000 cells per well (human). The percentage of viable cells from different treatment groups were plotted using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). Unpaired t-tests were used to compare means between two groups. All experiments were repeated independently at least three times with consistent results observed.\n\nSynthesis and analysis of NSD2i\n\nTo assess the consequences of pharmacological targeting of NSD2, we used a small molecule corresponding to compound 160 of US patent 2025/0276971 A1 (ref. 63) (Extended Data Fig. 9a), which is similar to KTX-1001, a compound currently being tested in an early-phase clinical trial for t(4,14) translocation-positive multiple myeloma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05651932). We synthesized this compound using a previously described method63, with minor modifications (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Full details of the chemical synthesis and characterization are provided in the Supplementary Information. The purified NSD2i compound was then tested for its ability to inhibit the activity of a range of histone methyltransferases in vitro.\n\nExpression and purification of recombinant methyltransferase proteins\n\nNSD1(SET) (amino acids 1853–2093, NCBI sequence: NC_000005.10), NSD2(SET) (amino acids 958–1365, NCBI sequence: NC_000004.12), NSD3(SET) (amino acids 1021–1320, NCBI sequence: NC_000008.11), ASH1L(SET) (amino acids 1980–2564, NCBI sequence: NC_000001.11), SETD2(SET) (amino acids 1323–2564, NCBI sequence: NC_000003.12) and SUV39H1(SET) (amino acids 82–412, NCBI sequence: NC_000023.11) were cloned into pGEX-6P-1. Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with the respective expression vectors and cultivated in LB medium (10 g l–1 tryptone, 5 g l–1 yeast extract and 10 g l–1 NaCl) supplemented with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (MilliporeSigma) at 18 °C for 16–20 h. Cells were lysed by sonication, lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 h and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione sepharose (GE Healthcare) for purification, with recombinant proteins eluted in 10 mM reduced glutathione (MilliporeSigma). Protein concentrations were measured using Pierce Coomassie Plus assays. MLL1 complex and PRC2 complex were purchased (Active Motif).\n\nDetermination of IC 50 for NSD2i\n\nA MTase-Glo Methyltransferase Assay kit (Promega) was used to measure the IC 50 for NSD2i with different lysine methyltransferases. A 10 μl reaction system was assembled with 25 nM lysine methyltransferase enzyme (or enzyme complex), 0.5 µM SAM, 100 nM mononucleosome (EpiCypher), MTase-Glo reagent (1×) and a series of diluted NSD2i in reaction buffer (containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 10% glycerol) in a white 384-well microplate (Corning). NSD2i was serially diluted from 30 μM to 0 μM in threefold concentrations. Each reaction was performed in triplicate and incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. Subsequently, 10 μl MTase-Glo Detection solution was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were detected by luminescence, and the relative activity of enzymes calculated with the initial data. IC 50 values were analysed using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0).\n\nNSD2i treatment of organoids\n\nWe pretreated mouse and human organoids with NSD2i for 12 or 21 days, respectively, before 5 days of co-treatment with NSD2i and enzalutamide. Organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE and seeded at a density of 1,000 cells per well (mouse) in neuroendocrine organoid culture medium without DHT in a 96-well low-attachment dish with 5% Matrigel (mouse) or as a total of 25,000 cells (human) in a 50 µl 80% Matrigel button in human neuroendocrine culture medium without DHT. DMSO or NSD2i at concentrations ranging from 0.3 µM to 10 µM were added on the day of plating and replenished every other day. Following pretreatment, organoids were dissociated into single cells and seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well (mouse) or 10,000 cells per well (human) in a 96-well low-attachment dish in the same culture medium. The next day, DMSO or the same concentration of NSD2i were dispensed together with enzalutamide at threefold dilutions ranging from 3 nM to 10,000 nM in 0.1% DMSO. Cell viability was assayed after 5 days using CellTiter-Glo 3D (Promega, G9683), with luminescence measured by a GloMax Explorer multimode plate reader (Promega, v.3.1.0).\n\nTo detect apoptotic cell death, organoids were dissociated into single cells and seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells per well (human) in a 96-well low-attachment dish in the same culture medium. DMSO (negative control), 10 µM bortezomib (Cayman Chemical, 10008822) as a positive control or NSD2i was dispensed together with a threefold dilution series of enzalutamide from 3 nM to 10,000 nM in 0.1% DMSO. Apoptotic cell death was assayed after 24–48 h treatment using a Caspase-Glo(R) 3/7 3D assay (Promega, G8981), with luminescence measured by a GloMax Explorer multimode plate reader (Promega, v.3.1.0). Luminescence values were first normalized to the DMSO-treated controls and then compared with 10 µM bortezomib treatment, which induces 100% apoptotic cell death after 24 or 48 h. The resulting signals normalized to a percentage of maximal response were plotted using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0).\n\nTo investigate epigenomic changes after drug treatment, non-neuroendocrine NPPO-1nonNE, NPPO-7, NPPO-8 and NPPO-9 organoids were seeded at density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates in 5% Matrigel in organoid culture medium without DHT. On the day after seeding, DMSO, 1 µM enzalutamide or the combination of 1 µM enzalutamide and 1 µM NSD2i was added into the culture medium and replenished every other day. On day 40 after treatment, organoids were collected for fixation by 10% formalin for immunofluorescence staining or for flash-freezing with liquid nitrogen for western blot analysis. Western blotting for AR protein using the antibody listed in Supplementary Table 6 was performed using the methods described above.\n\nDHT agonist treatment of organoids\n\nTo investigate whether NSD2 targeting restores AR activity, NPPO-1NE, NPPO-2 and MSKPCa10 organoids transfected with sgControl or sgNsd2 were cultured in organoid culture medium without DHT for three passages. The organoids were then dissociated and seeded at density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well ultralow attachment microplates in 5% Matrigel in organoid culture medium without DHT. One day after seeding, 100 nM DHT or DMSO was added to the medium and replenished every other day. Cell numbers were counted every other day using a TC20 automated cell counter.\n\nMultidrug synergy analysis\n\nTo analyse synergy between NSD2i and enzalutamide, the multidose combination response data generated from CellTiter-Glo 3D assays were input into SynergyFinder (v.3.0; https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi), a web application for interactive analysis and visualization of multidrug combination response data. NSD2i and enzalutamide drug combination responses were calculated based on the Bliss reference model using SynergyFinder64. Deviations between observed and expected responses with positive and negative values denote synergy and antagonism, respectively. For estimation of outlier measurements, the cNMF algorithm65 implemented in SynergyFinder was used.\n\nGrafting assays\n\nTo generate tumours in vivo, mouse NPp53 or human prostate organoids were grafted into 6–8-week-old NOD/SCID male mice (NOD.CB17-PrkdcScid/J, Jackson Laboratory, 001303). NOD/SCID mice underwent surgical castration at 7 days before grafting. For mouse grafts, 1 × 106 dissociated organoid cells in 100 µl hepatocyte culture medium and 5% Matrigel were subcutaneously injected into the flank using a 1 ml syringe with a 25 G needle (BD, 305122). For human grafts, 3 × 106 dissociated cells in 100 µl 60% Matrigel and 40% hepatocyte culture medium were injected. Tumour sizes were measured with a digital caliper. Mice were randomly assigned to cohorts for treatment. In each cohort, 20–24 mice whose tumour volume had reached about 250 mm3 (mouse grafts) or 80 mm3 (human grafts) at week 2 after grafting received either 10 mg kg–1 enzalutamide (TargetMol, T6002) or 0.5% DMSO (MilliporeSigma, D2650) by daily gavage through a 20 G needle (Roboz, FN-7910) for 14 days (mouse grafts) or 56 days (human grafts). Enzalutamide or DMSO was suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose (MilliporeSigma, 419281) and 0.1% Tween 80 (MilliporeSigma, P4780) in distilled water. At the end of drug treatment, tumours were collected and imaged under a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX16) with digital camera (Olympus, DP71), and image acquisition was performed with an Olympus DP Controller (v.3.3.1). Investigators were blinded to data collection and analysis. Tumour sizes never exceeded the maximal limit of 8,000 mm3 permitted by the IACUC at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Tumour tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for 24–48 h and processed at the Columbia Molecular Pathology Core Facility. Tumour volumes were calculated using the formula:\n\n$${{\\rm{V}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{m}}{\\rm{e}}={\\rm{w}}{\\rm{i}}{\\rm{d}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{h}}}^{2}\\times \\frac{{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{g}}{\\rm{t}}{\\rm{h}}}{2}$$\n\nTumour growth curves were plotted using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0). Two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc testing were used to compare differences between means.\n\nDrug treatment assays in vivo\n\nFor drug treatment, NSD2i, enzalutamide or DMSO were suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose and 0.1% Tween 80 in distilled water. To generate human prostate organoid grafts, 3 × 106 dissociated cells in 100 µl 60% Matrigel and 40% human hepatocyte culture medium were subcutaneously injected into the flank of castrated NOD/SCID male mice. To access NSD2i potency and specificity in vivo, 12 mice grafted with WCM1262 organoid cells with a tumour volume of about 100 mm3 at 3 weeks after grafting received 75 mg kg–1, 150 mg kg–1 or 300 mg kg–1 NSD2i or 0.5% DMSO by daily gavage through a 20 G needle for 5 days. Tumours were then collected and dissociated into single cells for western blot analyses of histone marks.\n\nTo investigate response to NSD2i and enzalutamide, we used cohorts of 24 mice for each organoid line examined. In each cohort, mice with a tumour volume of about 80–86 mm3 at 2 weeks after grafting received either 150 mg kg–1 NSD2i or 0.5% DMSO by daily gavage through a 20 G needle for 14 days. The 12 mice in the NSD2i treatment group were then subdivided into two groups for treatment with 150 mg kg–1 NSD2i alone or 150 mg kg–1 NSD2i with 10 mg kg–1 enzalutamide for another 4 weeks. The 12 mice from the DMSO control group were also subdivided for further treatment with DMSO or with 10 mg kg–1 enzalutamide for another 4 weeks. The tumours were collected and imaged using a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX16) with a digital camera (Olympus DP71), using an Olympus DP Controller (Olympus, v.3.3.1.292). Tumour sizes never exceeded the maximal limit of 8,000 mm3 permitted by the IACUC at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Tumour tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for 24–48 h and processed at the Columbia Molecular Pathology Core Facility. Tumour volumes and growth curves were calculated as described above. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc testing were used to compare means among groups.\n\nDetection of proliferation and apoptosis in tumour sections\n\nTumour sections were stained for Ki67 or CC3 together with at least one lineage marker: CHGA, SYP or CD56. Antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 6. Tiled scans of whole tumour tissue sections were imaged using a Leica STELLARIS 5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems), and image acquisition was performed using Leica Application Suite X (LAS X v.4.5.0). For quantitation of proliferation and apoptosis, six regions of interest were chosen randomly on the whole slide image using QuPath (v.0.5.1)66. A machine-learning classifier was trained for identification of Ki67+ or CC3+ cells using the built-in functions in QuPath, and the percentage of Ki67+ or CC3+ cells were measured in each region of interest. An average percentage out of six regions was determined per xenograft specimen and plotted using Prism (GraphPad software, v.10.5.0).\n\nPre-processing of scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data\n\nscRNA-seq and snRNA-seq samples were processed independently using scanpy (v.1.9.1) for Python (v.3.9)67. Cells with >1,000 detected genes and 1,000 unique molecular identificer (UMI) counts were retained, whereas cells with >10,000 detected genes or 50,000 UMI counts and with >20% of mitochondrial gene content were discarded. For doublet detection and removal, we used the Scrublet (v.0.2.2) algorithm as implemented in scanpy, applied to each sample independently. Each sample was then subsampled by retaining 3,000 cells that passed quality control, using the ‘subsample’ function with random state set to 666 as implemented in scanpy. All samples processed with the same technology (that is, single-cell or single-nuclei) were merged and UMI counts per cell were converted to sum to 1e4 and log-normalized.\n\nReverse engineering of prostate organoid regulatory networks\n\nFor each scRNA-seq sample, a shared neighbours graph was built with k nn = 15 to select cells with the most similar transcriptional profiles and to merge them to generate high-resolution ensembles of cells (metacells). This approach augments the number of detected genes per cell, which usually is very low owing to technological dropout bias (<20%), thus increasing the number of targets that can be recovered by reverse engineering of regulatory networks. Metacell profiles were computed on normalized data, merged into UMI counts, and transformed to CPM for downstream analysis.\n\nA sample-specific regulatory network (interactome) was reverse engineered from the resulting metacell CPM profiles (n = 500) using ARACNe-AP19, the most recent implementation of the ARACNe algorithm18, with 200 bootstraps, a mutual Information (MI) P value threshold P ≤ 10–8 and data processing inequality (DPI) enabled. Regulatory proteins (RPs) were selected into manually curated protein sets, including transcription factors (TFs), co-TFs or chromatin-remodelling enzymes, using the Gene Ontology (GO) identifiers GO:0003700 and GO:0003712. Each RP regulon (RP gene targets) was integrated across all the reverse-engineered networks to realize one final network. To avoid bias due to different regulon sizes, regulons were pruned to include only the 50 highest likelihood targets17, and regulons with <50 targets were excluded from the analysis. Mouse prostate cancer scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq gene expression profiles were scaled independently and transformed to protein activity profiles using the metacell-derived regulatory network and the VIPER algorithm as implemented in pyVIPER (viper-in-python, v.1.0.9)68. All samples were merged to be projected on a two-dimensional plane using Diffusion Maps69. Diffusion Maps were computed using a KNN graph constructed from Harmony-corrected principal components, with single-cell technology (that is, single-cell or single-nucleus) specified as the batch variable70.\n\nTo recover cell identities, clusters of cells that share the same regulatory programs were identified using automated community detection of cell populations (ACDC)71, a scanpy-compatible tool that identifies optimal clustering parameters based on heuristics using acdc_py (v.1.1.0; https://github.com/VasciaveoLab/acdc_py). Specifically, ACDC performed a grid search analysis to tune the Leiden clustering algorithm resolution parameter to maximize the average of within-cluster silhouette scores across each candidate optimal clustering solution. A high silhouette score is an indication that clustered cells have homogenous profiles, as sampled from the same cell population. The optimal solution produced three major clusters.\n\nSingle-sample gene set enrichment analysis and AR targets analysis\n\nTo perform enrichment for AR canonical targets57, pseudo-bulk samples were created by averaging the expression of each gene in each individual sample from snRNA-seq data, processed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with normalized enrichment scores and nominal P values determined by 1,000 permutations of gene labels using permutation tests.\n\nIntegration of CUT&Tag and VIPER analysis of snRNA-seq data\n\nHistone mark count matrices were processed using limma ‘voom’ (v.3.54.2). Linear models were fitted for each gene based on the voom-transformed data with moderated t-statistics computed using the eBayes method from limma. A contrast matrix was built to compare differential H3K36me2 histone marks between untreated cells and NSD2 knockout or H3.3K36M transfection. Top-ranked genes were extracted using the topTable function and genes with log[fold change] < −0.5 and false discovery rate < 0.1 were retained. This gene set was then used for GSEA analysis on gene expression signatures computed as differential between cluster 1 and cluster 3 across conditions (for example, NPPO-1NE sgNSD2 cluster 1 versus NPPO-1NE sgCtrl cluster 3; Extended Data Fig. 6). Normalized enrichment scores and nominal P values were determined by 1,000 random permutations of gene labels using permutation tests. For differential gene expression analysis Seurat (v.4.1.3) was used, with parameter test.use set to DESeq2 (v.1.28.0) in the ‘FindMarkers’ function.\n\nStatistics and reproducibility\n\nAll experiments described in this study include sufficient biological replicates to draw statistically meaningful conclusions. Detailed statistical methods, including statistical tests used, error bar definitions, exact sample size (n values), P values and whether the test is one-sided or two-sided, are described in the Methods and corresponding figure legends. Statistical methods were not used to predetermine sample size. Source data for all western blot and gel images are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. All western blots, H&E and immunofluorescence staining were performed at least three times on different batches of samples to ensure that the results are reproducible. Representative images shown in the figures correspond to reproducible general conclusions.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Prostate cancer can become very hard to treat when it stops responding to hormone therapy. This advanced stage is called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). One problem is that cancer cells change their type, making them resistant to drugs.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists studied a protein called NSD2 that affects how cancer cells behave. By blocking NSD2 along with the androgen receptor (which responds to male hormones), they were able to stop cancer cells from changing type. They used mouse models and human cancer cell clusters called organoids to test this. When NSD2 was blocked, tumors stopped growing and cancer cells died.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it shows a new way to treat aggressive prostate cancer that no longer reacts to usual hormone treatments. Targeting NSD2 can reverse the cancer cells’ ability to change, making them sensitive again to drugs. This could help many patients who currently have few options.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers are planning to test this NSD2-targeting approach further, including in clinical trials with patients. They will study how well the treatment works and if it can be combined safely with existing drugs like enzalutamide.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Blocking NSD2 protein can reverse drug resistance in advanced prostate cancer, offering a promising new treatment strategy.\n",

      "content": "Fabrication of the slipknot\n\nAll experiments were conducted at room temperature (21 °C). The loading rate was set at 10 mm min–1 during the slipknot-tying process. To ensure the reproducibility of the slipknots, we used a standardized fabrication method with a 3D-printed string-wrapping board. The designed grooves of the board conformed to the spatial configuration of the slipknot (Extended Data Fig. 1). String was wrapped along these grooves to produce standardized slipknots. The upper right side and lower right end of each slipknot were clamped, and the untightened slipknot was subjected to tension using a Zwick/Roell Z010 testing machine until a preset force F tying was achieved. Following this procedure, standardized slipknots with F tying were fabricated.\n\nHigh-speed camera recordings\n\nWe used a high-speed camera (C321, Phantom) to capture the evolution of slipknot configurations during release from the front view (Fig. 2a(i–v)). The camera operated at 11,000 f.p.s. with a 10-μs electronic shutter speed using macro lenses (100MM F2.8 CA-Dreamer Macro ×2 lenses, Anhui Changgeng Optics Technology). It recorded images at 640 × 128 pixels with a 10-bit depth.\n\nMicro-CT scanning\n\nWe used a micro-CT system (Xradia 610 Versa, Zeiss) with a voxel size of 1.3 × 1.3 × 1.3 µm3 to scan slipknots and to reconstruct their 3D structures based on five typical states. The micro-CT system was set to operate at 120 kV and 17.5 W. Each scan involved an exposure time of 2,500 ms per projection, during which the slipknots were securely positioned and examined for approximately 170 min. We fabricated an in situ tensile fixture (Supplementary Fig. 18) that fit in the sample chamber of the micro-CT scanner. This fixture enabled application of a preset tensile force to the slipknot, allowing it to be gradually opened to any desired state and maintaining it in a stable configuration throughout the scanning process. Micro-CT modelling and analyses were performed using Amira 3D software (v.2021.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nFEM of slipknots\n\nFEM of the string slipknot was performed using Abaqus 2020 and the Abaqus/Explicit solver for computations. A model representing the slipknot was formulated using 8-node linear brick mesh elements with reduced integration and hourglass control (C3D8R). The material behaviour of the string was characterized by elastoplasticity. Elasticity was captured by using linear elasticity with an elastic modulus of 2,700 MPa and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.49. The plasticity was captured by using a plasticity model of combined hardening by fitting cyclic tensile test data (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 19). The contact condition was modelled using a general contact-type interaction with a friction coefficient of 0.16 (Extended Data Fig. 6).\n\nThe simulation processes of slipknot tying, tightening and opening were visualized. First, the string was tied into a slipknot by implementing prescribed displacement sequences to the key points along the string. Second, the slipknot was tightened with a preset force. The pre-tension was maintained in one step and was unloaded afterwards. Third, the slipknot was opened by moving the free end away from the fixed end.\n\nMechanical test\n\nWe conducted a series of mechanical tests to explore the mechanical characteristics of slipknots, including consistency tests, parametric relationship tests and stability tests. All slipknots were made of fluorocarbon string (YGK) and each test contained five samples.\n\nIn the consistency test, 500 slipknots with single-knot loops were fabricated with a string diameter of d = 0.235 mm and a preset force F tying = 7.500 N. In the parametric relationship test, we studied the influence of the number of knot loops, the preset force F tying and the string diameter d on the open force F peak . First, we used string (d = 0.235 mm) to fabricate slipknots with different knot-loop numbers (single, double or triple) and different preset forces of F tying (2.500 N, 5.000 N, 7.500 N, 10.000 N, 12.500 N, 15.000 N and 17.500 N). Next, with F tying = 5.000 N, we used string of different diameters (0.148 mm, 0.165 mm, 0.235 mm, 0.285 mm and 0.333 mm) to fabricate slipknots with different knot-loop numbers (single, double or triple). In the stability test, the slipknots were tested after a time period (day 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32). The tested slipknots had a string diameter of d = 0.235 mm and different knot-loop numbers (single, double or triple). All the slipknot samples were tested using a Zwick/Roell Z010 testing machine. The slipknots were opened at a speed of 50 mm min–1, and the F peak values were recorded. Finally, in the stability test, slipknots (d = 0.235 mm) with different knot-loop numbers (single, double or triple) were opened at different speeds (5 mm min–1, 10 mm min–1, 20 mm min–1, 40 mm min–1, 60 mm min–1, 80 mm min–1 and 100 mm min–1), and the F peak values were recorded.\n\nFriction test\n\nWe conducted friction tests to measure the kinetic friction coefficients of three types of filaments: fluorocarbon monofilament (d = 0.235 mm, YGK), braided absorbable sutures (4-0 Vicryl, Ethicon) and braided non-absorbable sutures (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon). Tests were carried out under dry, moist and lubricated conditions. The moist conditions included synthetic blood (Phygene Biotechnology), simulated body fluid (Phygene Biotechnology) and natural saline (Phygene Biotechnology). The lubricated condition was silicone oil 10 mPa·s (Aladdin). We established a friction measurement fixture, whereby a filament was suspended above a spiral tube through a pulley system (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Bearings applied the controllable normal force (F n ) to press the filament firmly against the spiral tube, which was wrapped with the same filament. The spiral tube was placed in a tank to enable tests in moist and lubricated conditions. By steadily pulling the filament using a universal testing machine, the tangential force (F τ ) was measured. F τ under varying F n was recorded and analysed through linear regression to determine the kinetic friction coefficient of the filament. The friction coefficients in moist and lubricated conditions were evaluated by dripping different volumes of liquids onto the filament–tube contact region. We also replaced the spiral tube with a silicone block to measure friction coefficients between the filament and silicone (Extended Data Fig. 3b–d).\n\nOpening sliputures under dry, moist and lubricated conditions\n\nTo examine whether exposure to fluid in a real surgical environment interacts with the slipknot, which would further influence the F peak , we conducted a series of opening sliputure tests using various types of filaments, including fluorocarbon monofilament (YGK), braided absorbable sutures (Vicryl, Ethicon) and braided non-absorbable sutures (Mersilk, Ethicon) (Extended Data Fig. 4). Each material was tested under dry, moist and lubricated conditions, with five samples per group. For fluorocarbon monofilaments, we used string (d = 0.235 mm) to fabricate slipknots with double-knot loops and different preset forces of F tying (2.500 N, 5.000 N, 7.500 N and 10.000 N). For braided absorbable sutures and non-absorbable sutures, strings (4-0, d = 0.150 mm) were used to fabricate slipknots with double-knot loops and different preset forces of F tying (0.100 N, 0.200 N, 0.350 N, 0.400 N, 0.800 N, 1.600 N and 3.200 N). All the samples were tested using a Zwick/Roell Z020 testing machine in dry conditions, in synthetic blood (Phygene Biotechnology), in simulated body fluid (Phygene Biotechnology), in natural saline (Phygene Biotechnology) and in silicone oil 10 mPa·s (Aladdin). The slipknots were released at a speed of 30 mm min–1, and the F peak values were recorded.\n\nWearable knot-tying force test platform\n\nA wearable knot-tying force test platform (Supplementary Fig. 20) was constructed to accurately measure the tension in sutures during a surgical suturing process. The platform consisted of a knob, two pulleys, a slider, a steel wire and a load cell (SBT641C, Simbatouch). One end of the suture was secured to the slider through the knob, and the adjacent pulley guided the suture, thereby minimizing the impact of hand-posture variations on force measurement. The slider was connected to the load cell by a steel wire (d = 0.8 mm) running through the upper pulley. During suturing, the surgeon positioned their index finger through a hole in the device, with the thumb resting on the shell above the pulley next to the load cell. Tension in the suture was directly measured by the load cell as the suture was pulled through the platform.\n\nBimanual real-time dynamometer\n\nA bimanual real-time dynamometer platform was developed to accurately capture tensile forces applied by both hands during surgical knot tying. The system consisted of a medical sterile interface, a passive revolute joint and a quick connector (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The sterile interface ensured clinical compatibility, and the passive revolute joint provided a free rotational range of 80° (Supplementary Fig. 21b), which enabled natural wrist movement and reduced the influence of hand posture or angle on measurements. To eliminate angular interference and to achieve high-fidelity force data, the dynamometer adopted a decoupled mechanical structure (Supplementary Fig. 21c), and the force applied through the suture was transmitted directly through the joint to the internal sensor. Notably, the platform supports simultaneous use of two devices, one for each hand, which enabled real-time, bilateral force measurement.\n\nKnot-tying force test across surgeons\n\nTo assess the clinical feasibility of the sliputure transmitting force, we designed a knotting-force test platform to measure knotting-force precision and incision pressure (Supplementary Fig. 4). This platform comprises three major components: (1) the desired sliputure with a slipknot on a braided common suture (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon); (2) a silicone practice model with pressure-sensitive films (4LW, Fuji film Prescale); and (3) a real-time dynamometer. Fabricating the sliputure with an F peak of 1.400 N (F tying = 0.350 N), we evaluated the impact of sliputure transmitting force on the knotting-force performance of surgeons31,32. Ten junior surgeons and five senior surgeons were randomly selected and recruited for the experiment. Junior surgeons were defined as surgeons with fewer than 10 years of clinical experience, whereas senior surgeons were those with more than 10 years of clinical experience. Each surgeon performed knot tying (n = 20) with common sutures (n = 10) and sliputures (n = 10). The real-time dynamometer collected data on the force used, and then we acquired the force data after data transformation (Supplementary Figs. 3a and 4). All force data were used for further comparative analyses.\n\nIncision pressure test of standing sutures\n\nTo evaluate the mechanical transmission ability of the sliputure, we used a silicone practice model along with pressure-sensitive film (4LW, Fuji film Prescale) to quantify incision pressures of standing sutures using sliputures and common sutures (Supplementary Fig. 3b). In the silicone practice model, we performed a 7-cm incision by laser cutting to simulate a wound. Adjacent to the incision at 0.5 cm from either side, 2 sets of circular holes measuring 1 mm in diameter were introduced parallel to the trajectory of the incision. These circular holes facilitated the entry and exit of the needle during the suturing process. To eliminate any interference among needles, a longitudinal spacing of 1 cm was maintained between neighbouring circular holes. Leveraging the midpoint of the feasible force range, we prepared an engineered slipknot (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon) with an F peak value of 1.300 N for subsequent experiments. Pressure-sensitive films (film A for colour rendering and film B for pressure assessment) were precisely positioned to match the contour of the simulated wound. Following the process of suturing and pre-tying knots, the pressure exerted by the slipknot on both sides of the wound made a red colour in film B. To ensure consistency, senior surgeons performed the same suturing procedures using both sliputures (n = 25) and common sutures (n = 25) on the silicone practice board. These suturing trials were conducted under open, laparoscopic (Hefei DVL Electron) and robotic (Intuitive Surgical-Fosun Medical Technology) surgical settings. During robotic surgery, the knotting velocity of the surgeon was quantified using Tracker (v.6.0.9). Subsequently, the colour intensity of the pressure-sensitive film A, which corresponded to the applied pressure, was quantified by scanning the images and converting them into numerical values using commercial software (Fuji film FPD8010E v.2.5.0.3).\n\nIncision pressure test of continuous sutures\n\nTo evaluate the stress distribution of continuous sutures, we performed incision pressure tests of continuous sutures33 (n = 5) of five stitches on a silicone practice model (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 4). After excluding the influence of the anchor knot (first stitch) and the final knot (last stitch) on incision pressure, we chose the middle three stitches based on the oblique trajectory of the suture in continuous sutures. Subsequently, the pressure-sensitive films (4LW, Fuji film Prescale) embedded in the silicone were removed, and the films corresponding to the middle three stitches were selected for analyses. Colour changes were quantified by scanning the images and converting them into numerical values using commercial software (Fuji film FPD8010E).\n\nBimanual knot-tying force test\n\nThe bimanual knot-tying force test was conducted to measure and compare the forces on both sides of the sliputures (Supplementary Fig. 22). Five junior surgeons and five senior surgeons were randomly recruited for the experiment. Each surgeon wore real-time dynamometers bimanually and performed knot tying using sliputures of double-knot loops (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon) with an F peak value of 1.300 N (n = 10). During the test, the side with the slipknot was pulled and the peak force was defined as T active , whereas the other side without the slipknot was held stationary and the peak force was referred to as T fixed . The process was stopped after the release of the slipknot. The F peak values from both dynamometers were recorded for comparison.\n\nThe buffer zone of sliputures\n\nThe buffer zone of sliputures was determined through uniaxial tensile testing. Specifically, sliputures of double-knot loops (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon) with an F peak value of 1.300 N were used. Tests were conducted using a Zwick/Roell Z020 testing machine, equipped with an Xforce HP load cell (capacity of 200 N). Under uniaxial tensile loading of 10 mm min–1, the sliputures released and then formed a buffer zone after relaxation, where the suture remained kinked and bore zero load (Extended Data Fig. 8).\n\nSliputures for continuous sutures\n\nThe sliputures used for continuous suture of five stitches was as follows. At the first stitch, we used a sliputure (Suture A, 4-0 Vicryl, Ethicon) to tie an anchor knot at the proximal end of the incision. Continuous sutures of four stitches were then performed using the same suture procedure as usual, leaving the final stitch unknotted. Subsequently, a second sliputure with two slipknots (Suture B, 4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon) was used to place one stitch at the distal end of the incision, with the slipknot near the incision being first used to form an anchor knot. Finally, two sutures were tied together to complete the final knot (Supplementary Fig. 12).\n\nFeasible force-range exploration\n\nTo systematically explore the feasible force range for colonic injury repair, a mechanical test platform was assembled (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). This platform included the specimens to be tested, a dedicated tensiometer (DS2-50N, Zhiqu), a digitally controlled electric machine, a pump, a manometer and PBS solution containing methylene blue. The experimental procedure (Supplementary Fig. 5c) involved the introduction of a 2-mm-diameter injury into an ex vivo rat colon, specifically those of Sprague–Dawley rats weighing between 200 and 250 g (n = 20). The injury was generated using a biopsy punch (Dynarex). Subsequently, the punctured colon was bathed in a continuous solution of methylene blue maintained at a pressure of 20 mmHg. Pre-suturing was carried out using common sutures (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon). During the experimental phase, one end of the common suture remained secured, whereas the other end was horizontally pulled by the tensiometer at a controlled rate of 10 mm min–1. The tension applied was consistently monitored in real-time throughout the process. Post-test analyses involved categorizing the tension as F min once the injury was successfully repaired without leakage. Conversely, the tension was labelled as F max when the colonic wall tore and leakage occurred. The boundaries of the feasible force range were subsequently determined based on the F min and F max values. The feasible force range can also be predicted by mechanical modelling (Supplementary Note 5).\n\nEx vivo and in vivo rat colonic injury repair\n\nTo compare the sliputure transmitting force in both ex vivo and in vivo conditions, we conducted experiments using female Sprague–Dawley rats weighing between 200 and 250 g. The rats were randomly divided into two groups: the ex vivo group (n = 5) and the in vivo group (n = 5). The experiments involving the sliputure (target F peak = 1.300 N) were carried out on an automated mechanical test platform (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). For both ex vivo and in vivo tests, a 2-mm-diameter injury was introduced to the resected colon using a biopsy punch (Dynarex). Subsequently, the injury was repaired by the tensiometer at a consistent rate of 10 mm min–1 using a sliputure under 20 mmHg of intraluminal pressure. After the availability of the opened signal of the slipknot, we recorded the force data from the tensiometer and halted the electric machine to stop the tensiometer. Afterwards, a reverse knot was tied to secure the surgical knots (surgeon’s knot). For the in vivo test, the distal colon and small intestine were clamped 2-cm apart from the repaired region. PBS solution containing methylene blue was introduced through the repair area to assess colonic leakage. In summary, we compared the force data and operation efficacy of colonic leakage between ex vivo and in vivo groups to evaluate the mechanical transmission of sliputures.\n\nComparison of anastomotic leakage, postsurgical adhesion and tissue ischaemia\n\nFemale Sprague–Dawley rats weighing between 200 and 250 g were randomly allocated into two groups: the sliputure group and the common suture group. This division aimed to facilitate a comparative study of anastomotic leakage, postsurgical adhesion and tissue ischaemia. The experimental procedures were performed by a junior surgeon with 2 years of clinical experience. This surgeon was affiliated with the Department of General Surgery of another tertiary hospital and had no conflict of interest. To minimize bias, the surgeon was blinded to the study objectives while tying the common sutures. Following a 24-h fasting period, rats were anaesthetized through intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (80 mg kg–1). The rats were then placed on a heated pad for the surgery. After abdominal hair was removed, laparotomy was performed to expose the colon. Using a biopsy punch (Dynarex), a 2-mm-diameter injury was created in the colon. In the subgroup focusing on leakage, the injury was repaired using sliputures (n = 10) with an F peak value of 1.300 N, whereas common sutures were used in the control group (n = 10). To observe and compare colonic leakage, the distal colon and small intestine were clamped 2 cm away from the repaired region. Subsequently, PBS solution containing methylene blue was injected through the repair site. In the subgroup assessing adhesion, after colonic injury repair as described above, continuous sutures (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon) were used to close the peritoneum, and interrupted sutures (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon) were used to close the abdomen. On the seventh day postoperatively, the repaired colon was exposed and adhesion rates were observed and compared between the sliputure-treated group (n = 10) and the common-suture-treated group (n = 10). In the subgroup assessing tissue ischaemia, visualization of vascular conditions before and after biopsy puncture, as well as after repair using sliputures or common sutures, were carried out. This visualization was accomplished by LSCI. The same procedures for colonic injury repair and abdomen closure were performed. After concluding of all tests, the rats were humanely euthanized by CO 2 inhalation.\n\nComparison of wound healing\n\nFemale Sprague–Dawley rats weighing between 200 and 250 g were randomly allocated into two groups: the sliputure group and the common suture group. In each group, subgroups were divided as sliputure D1–D8 and common suture D1–D8 based on postsurgical days. The entire experimental process was carried out in a sterile environment. The preoperative preparations were consistent with the procedures outlined above. Through laparotomy, the colon of the rat was exposed, and a 2-mm-diameter injury was introduced using a biopsy punch (Dynarex). Sliputures and common sutures were used to repair the injury in the sliputure group and the common suture group, respectively. Postoperative assessments spanned from day 1 to day 8, which included animal euthanasia under CO 2 inhalation, daily tissue collection and burst pressure measurement in both groups (n = 3). On postoperative day 5, blood collection and analyses were conducted on a subset of rats in both the sliputure and common suture groups before humane euthanasia using CO 2 inhalation. The regions after repair were excised, fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and prepared for histological analyses.\n\nLSCI\n\nVessel visualization of the targeted colon area was conducted before and after biopsy puncture, as well as following the repair procedures using sliputures or common sutures, using LSCI. To mitigate potential motion artefacts, the targeted colon region was gently externalized and positioned on gauzes for stabilization. The maintenance of a stable blood flow was achieved through the continuous use of 37 °C saline solution. Once the parameters were set, HD mode was used to capture a clear speckle image depicting the distribution of blood flow in the intact target region of the colon. The exposure time for image acquisition was set at 5 s. Subsequently, after the introduction of a 2-mm-diameter biopsy puncture, additional speckle images were obtained using LSCI under the same parameter settings and measurement time. Following this, surgeons proceeded to repair the colonic injury with both sliputures and common sutures, and LSCI was used to capture speckle images with the same parameter settings and measurement time. This imaging process aimed to track and visualize the vascular dynamics of the targeted colon region before, during and after the surgical interventions to provide insights into the effects of the repair methods on blood flow and tissue perfusion. The data were collected using a Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging system RFLSI III (v.4.0).\n\nH&E and multiplex immunofluorescence staining\n\nTissue samples were collected from rats at designated time points and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Next, 4-μm-thick slides were cut from the paraffin-embedded intestinal tissue. For H&E staining, the slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated through graded alcohol solutions to water and stained with H&E for nucleus and cytoplasm staining. After dehydration, the stained slides were placed in mounting medium. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemical staining kit (Genecast Biotechnology). In brief, 4-μm-thick slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated and boiled in epitope retrieval solution for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, antibody block solution was used to block endogenous peroxidase for 10 min at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation, secondary antibody incubation and tyramine signalling amplification visualization were the procedures used to label one antigen. CD86 (19589S, CST, 1:400) and CD206 (60143-1-ig, Proteintech, 1:5000) were sequentially stained. The slides were placed in antifade mounting medium. Images were taken using a slide scanner (Hamamatsu, Nano Zoomer S60) and fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Eclipse C1). Image data were collected using CaseViewer software (v.2.4).\n\nLaparoscopic application of sliputures in a live porcine model\n\nIn vivo porcine experiments used female Bama miniature pigs (23–27 kg, 5–6 months of age) to demonstrate the application and function of the slipknot in laparoscopic surgery. The laparoscopic platform (Fig. 3j) was acquired from Karl Storz. After fasting for 24 h, pigs were premedicated with intramuscular atropine (0.04 mg kg–1), ketamine (10 mg kg–1) and midazolam (0.6 mg kg–1), induced with isoflurane (4%), endotracheally intubated and maintained with isoflurane (1–2%) during surgery. We placed the pigs in dorsal recumbency and aseptically prepared the abdominal region. Several trocars (Endopath Xcel, Ethicon and Kangji Medical) were placed on the abdomen to enable access of surgical instruments and a camera. Surgeons identified the colon and made a 1-cm-wide incision in the colon wall. After cleaning the lumen and disinfecting the intestinal incision, the intestinal injury was repaired using sliputures with inverting interrupted sutures (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon). A control group in which the injury in the colon wall was repaired using common sutures with inverting interrupted sutures (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon) was also performed for comparison. Observations for intestinal leakage were made 10 min after the process. The abdominal wall was closed in a multilayer fashion, and the animal was euthanized after the experiment.\n\nRobotic application of sliputures in a live porcine model\n\nIn vivo porcine experiments used female Bama miniature pigs (23–27 kg, 5–6 months of age) to demonstrate the application and function of the slipknot in robotic surgery. The robotic platform (Fig. 4a) was acquired from Intuitive Surgical-Fosun Medical Technology. After fasting for 24 h, pigs were premedicated with intramuscular atropine (0.04 mg kg–1), ketamine (10 mg kg–1) and midazolam (0.6 mg kg–1), induced with isoflurane (4%), endotracheally intubated and maintained with isoflurane (1–2%) during surgery. We placed the pigs in dorsal recumbency and aseptically prepared the abdominal region. Several trocars were placed on the abdomen to enable access of surgical instruments and a camera, and one additional trocar (Endopath Xcel, Ethicon) was placed to facilitate assistant operation. Surgeons identified the colon and made a 1-cm-wide incision in the colon wall. After cleaning the lumen and disinfecting the intestinal incision, the intestinal injury was repaired using sliputures with inverting interrupted sutures (4-0 Mersilk, Ethicon). The control group underwent the same procedure, but the repair was made using common sutures. Observation for intestinal leakage were performed 10 min after the process. The abdominal wall was closed in a multilayer fashion, and the animal was euthanized after the experiment.\n\nWe performed additional live porcine experiments, including induction of acute colonic perforation with peritonitis and colonic injury repair of female Bama miniature pigs (23–27 kg, 5–6 months of age) to compare the effects of standing sutures using sliputures, staples and continuous sutures under a robotic platform (Intuitive Surgical-Fosun Medical Technology). After fasting for 24 h, pigs were anaesthetized following the same protocol as described above. We placed the pigs in dorsal recumbency and aseptically prepared the abdominal region. Several trocars were placed on the abdomen to enable access of surgical instruments and a camera. Surgeons identified the colon and made three 1-cm-wide incisions in the colon wall at intervals of 3 cm. The abdominal wall was closed in a multilayer fashion.\n\nAfter fasting for 24 h, the porcine models of acute colonic perforation with peritonitis were anaesthetized following the same protocol as described above, and trocars were inserted at the same incision sites, with one additional trocar (Endopath Xcel, Ethicon) placed to facilitate assistant operation. Surgeons identified the colonic injury, disinfected the intestinal incisions and repaired them using continuous sutures, staples or standing sutures with sliputures. The appearance of tissue as the repaired injury site was recorded. Subsequently, indocyanine green (0.1 mg kg–1) was intravenously administered, followed by a 5 ml saline flush. Under fluorescence imaging of the robotic system, colonic vascular perfusion was observed 60 s after injection. Finally, the abdominal cavity was irrigated with saline and the abdominal wall was closed in a multilayer fashion.\n\nDevelopment and validation of a vision-based sliputure and slipknot detection system\n\nWe used the da Vinci Xi robotic system enhanced by a purely vision-based sliputure and slipknot detection system to validate the practicality and applicability of our proposed sliputure as a surgical consumable and non-electronic haptic sensor. To model sliputure and slipknot detection, we formulated it as a regression modelling problem by decoupling this process into sliputure line extraction and opened slipknot detection given by the following equations: Lines = Extractor (I) and Open slipknot = Detector(Lines), where I denotes RGB images of the first-person view from the da Vinci Xi endoscope, and Lines denote a set of sliputure lines extracted by the function Extractor(·). The extracted sliputures Lines were then input into a slipknot detector function Detector(·), which predicts whether there is an opened slipknot. Notably, the reason why we decoupled the modelling process into two parts is to fully leverage the advantages of data-driven methods by converting a specific medical problem into a general modelling problem while ensuring real-time performance for the surgical robotic system under limited data and instrument resources.\n\nSpecifically, for sliputure line extraction, we designed an encoder–decoder neural network based on a U-Net34 structure (named SlipknotNet, shown in Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9) to model the function Extractor(·), in which the image encoder is realized by a pretrained ResNet50 (ref. 35) and the decoder contains up-convolution operators, SENet36 modules and a suture-detection module. During the training stage, the parameters of the encoder were frozen using pretrained parameters from ImageNet37, whereas the parameters of the decoder were trained on over 1,800 annotated images by volunteer surgeons using our custom-made annotation software. We used a joint loss function including dice loss38 and focal loss39 using the following equation: Loss = α × dice loss + (1 – α) × focal loss. For the open slipknot detection, the function Detector(·) was realized by implementing template matching using the scale-invariant feature transform operator from OpenCV. The entire process of sliputure extraction and slipknot detection is visualized in Fig. 4a.\n\nIn both silicone practice models and live porcine colonic injury repair using sliputures teleoperated by the da Vinci Xi robotic system under real-time monitoring in 30 Hz with a local workstation (Ubuntu 22.04, Intel Core i9-14900, NVIDIA RTX 4090m), the aforementioned sliputure and slipknot detection scheme ran with a circle mark. A green mark flashing means no open slipknot detected, which allows continued control of the robotic arm. A red mark means the slipknot is open, and a stop control signal is sent to the robot console by UART communication, and a high-level internal stop from the robot is triggered. Our engineering code and dataset are both open-source and available on our project website40.\n\nAutomated system for standardized and rapid mass production of sliputures\n\nThe automated sliputure construction system comprises modules for wire feeding, force control, wire wrapping, slipknot collection and a user interface (Supplementary Fig. 16). The wire-feeding module supplies filament material (diameter of 0.1–2 mm, unlimited length) from a spool into wire-wrapping module, where it is precisely cut to the desired length. The wire-wrapping module uses coordinated motor-driven and pneumatic actuators to form slipknot configurations with the desired number of knot loops. The force control module, integrated with piezoelectric sensors and precision screw actuators, applies and maintains a F tying (0.1–20 N) on the constructed slipknot. After setting up the parameters, the system operates autonomously without manual intervention, thereby ensuring standardized and rapid mass production of sliputures.\n\nVision-based robotic dual-arm suture system for the slipknot application\n\nThe vision-based robotic dual-arm suture system consisted of two Franka Emika Panda 7 degree-of-freedom arms and a camera. The overall framework of the vision-based dual-arm suture system is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 14. The reference velocity of the active arm was set as 0.5 cm s–1. Through the real-time processing of greyscale images, the active arm automatically stops based on the opened signal of the slipknot (Supplementary Fig. 15).\n\nDNA slipknot molecular dynamic simulation\n\nCoarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations were performed using the program Gromacs with the Martini 2 force field for nucleic acids. The initial straight DNA structure with randomly assigned sequences had a length of approximately 670 nm and a diameter of 2.2 nm, comprising 130,000 atoms and 28,000 beads. A DNA knot was artificially constructed in the middle of the straight DNA. A triclinic simulation box with periodic boundaries in all three directions was used (Supplementary Fig. 17).\n\nThe atomic potential energy was minimized first using 1,000 static steps. In the dynamic simulations, we used a time step of 10 fs. The pressure was maintained at 1 bar with the Nosé–Hoover Langevin piston and the temperature was maintained at 273 K using a Langevin thermostat. The DNA knot was untangled by pulling one end of the DNA at a velocity of 0.01 nm ps–1. The total simulation time for untangling the DNA knot was around 5 ns. The atomic structure was visualized using visual molecular dynamics.\n\nSlipknot-enhanced safe human–robot interactions\n\nBuilding on the demonstrated clinical success and the inherent capability of slipknots to precisely limit force release, we extended its versatility to robotics by integrating sliputures into a custom-built 4 degree-of-freedom cable-driven robotic arm, engineered as an adjustable mechanical fuse to ensure safe human–robot interactions (Fig. 4g,h, Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Video 16). The actuation architecture incorporated two direct-drive systems for the base and the shoulder, as well as two independent tendon routes that drive the bidirectional motion of the elbow and wrist joints, with a slipknot strategically embedded in the forearm segment to monitor and regulate inter-joint forces. The actuation transmission pathway is instantaneously interrupted when the tension force at the sliputure exceeds a pre-programmed threshold F peak due to an overloaded external interaction, achieved through slipknot-mediated cable elongation that dissipates stored mechanical energy. This enables simultaneous protection of humans and delicate objects from excessive force and the safeguarding of robotic components from structural overload during impact events. It is worth noting that the capability to flexibly adjust the F peak of the slipknot enables on-demand control of contact loads, a critical feature for human–robot interactions. Unlike traditional solutions, this purely mechanical safety solution operates without requiring auxiliary electronics or additional mass at the end-effector, demonstrating its applicability for seamless integration into existing robotic platforms.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nCategorical variables were described using frequency and percentage, which were assessed using Fisher’s exact tests or Chi-square tests between groups. Continuous variables are presented as the mean and standard deviations, which were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Student’s t-tests. GraphPad Prism (v.9.5.0, GraphPad Software) was used for all statistical analyses in the study. In statistical analyses, the significance thresholds were considered as *P < 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01 and ***P ≤ 0.001.\n\nAnimal studies\n\nStudy design\n\nNo formal sample size calculation was performed, and the number of samples was determined by the maximum available resources. In animal experiments that explored the feasible force range, a sample size of n = 20 was used. For ex vivo and in vivo rat colonic injury repair, the sample sizes were n = 5 for ex vivo and n = 5 for in vivo experiments. For comparison of anastomotic complications, the sample sizes were n = 10 in the sliputure group and n = 10 in the control group. For comparison of wound healing, the sample sizes were n = 3 for each subgroup from days 1–8 in both the sliputure and control groups. Laparoscopic and robotic experiments were conducted with a minimum of one pig per group. No statistical methods were applied to calculate sample sizes. The animal samples prepared by the same method were randomly allocated to each group. Blinding was not used in this study.\n\nAnimals\n\nThe following animals were used in experiments: female, specific pathogen-free Sprague–Dawley rats aged 4 weeks and weighing 200−250 g; and female Bama miniature pigs aged 5–6 months and weighing 23−27 kg.\n\nEthics\n\nAll animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Zhejiang University (ZJU20230084 and ZJU20250067), and postoperative care was supervised at the Animal Experimental Center of Sir Run-Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University.\n\nSurgeon participant studies\n\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University (approval numbers 2023-0528 and 2025-0023).\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

In animal tests, it improved healing and lowered complications compared to regular sutures. The sliputure also acts as a safety feature in robots, stopping movements if forces get too high, protecting both patients and machines. This is the first time such a purely mechanical, non-electronic system has shown promise for both surgery and safe human-robot interaction.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers plan to further test the sliputure system in clinical trials with human patients and explore how to integrate it into more types of surgical robots and tools.
