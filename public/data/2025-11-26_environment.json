      "content": "Hoverflies, often mistaken for bees and wasps, pollinate three quarters of our crops. Now we’re discovering we can train them to be even more efficient\n\nDara Ojo\n\nIt takes Mandela Fernández-Grandon 15 minutes to train a hoverfly, a harmless wasp look-alike. The entomologist at the University of Greenwich, UK, immobilises each tiny insect in a cocoon-like holder, then releases a flowery scent near its antennae. Next comes a sugary reward, which makes the hoverfly extend its proboscis – a long, tube-like mouthpart used to drink nectar.\n\nAfter a couple of trials, the hoverfly reacts the moment it detects the aroma, like Pavlov’s dogs at the sound of a bell. And the hungrier it is, the faster it learns. Fernández-Grandon thinks such training could make hoverflies better pollinators, with benefits for agriculture.\n\nIn fact, these long-overlooked creatures could help offset the collapse of bees, which has been widely reported in recent years and often obscures the importance of other pollinators. “They are not as cute as bees,” admits Fernández-Grandon. “They just don’t have the same publicity.” But now that we are gaining a better understanding of these incredible insects, that could be changing.\n\nBetter than bees\n\nEven without training, hoverflies pollinate almost three-quarters of global food crop species, a service worth $300 billion per year. And they have several advantages over bees. “In some ways, they’re potentially more useful,” says entomologist Will Hawkes at the University of Exeter, UK. For a start, they aren’t deterred by bad weather and, unlike bees, they migrate thousands of miles, dispersing pollen over vast distances. What’s more, their larvae decompose dead matter and devour pests.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“Isn’t it fantastic that you can have something that, in its juvenile stage, is providing pest-control service and reducing our reliance on synthetic pesticides, and then they grow up and become pollinators?” says Fernández-Grandon.\n\nMany hoverfly species resemble wasps or bees, but they aren’t actually closely related to them. Hoverflies, which probably evolved their deceptive appearance to protect against predators, can be recognised by their stillness in midair, compared with wasps’ purposeful darting. These tiny drones are an engineer’s dream: they can accelerate quickly, change direction in a mere six wing-beats and fly at speeds in excess of 35 kilometres an hour. This is impressive considering their size, as larger animals generally fly faster.\n\nWorldwide, there are about 6000 hoverfly species, some living on mountaintops 4000 metres above sea level, others in the Arctic. The UK alone is home to 279 species – 19 more than bees. These include the marmalade hoverfly, which resembles a tiny wasp and can be spotted in suburban gardens, often hanging out over sunlit daisies and dandelions. The narcissus bulb fly is more similar to the bumblebee, as it is rounder and quite hairy. And the long hoverfly, as its name suggests, is slender, resembling a wasp that has been stretched into a flying stick.\n\nPest control services\n\nJust like honeybees and their larvae, adult hoverflies feed on pollen and nectar. But hoverfly larvae have different tastes. They can be found on dead wood, rotting plants or dung, feeding and helping to decompose organic matter. Some even filter bacteria and fungi from freshwater – and have the potential to be used to clean up sewage.\n\nThen there are the predatory hoverfly larvae that farmers can buy as a form of natural pest control. Lab experiments show that hoverfly larvae can feed fast enough to suppress populations of pests in various crops, from wheat to apples. A single marmalade hoverfly larva can devour as many as 400 cereal-infesting aphids during its development. Eupeodes corollae, the species Fernández-Grandon trains, can kill off 62 per cent of aphids on strawberries. On melons, that rate can be close to 100 per cent.\n\nThe marmalade hoverfly resembles a tiny wasp Heather Angel/naturepl.com\n\nWhen it comes to pollination, honeybees may look slightly better on paper: they pollinate 80 per cent of flowering plant species. Hoverflies, meanwhile, do so for about 70 per cent of the wildflowers that depend on animals for pollination and 72 per cent of all food crops. A single hoverfly also tends to be a less efficient pollinator than a honeybee.\n\nOne key factor is hairiness: insects that are hairier, especially on their faces, can carry more pollen than less-fuzzy species, which includes most hoverflies. A furry ball of a bumblebee, for example, can carry 15,000 grains of pollen on its body. That’s around four times as many as a common drone fly, a type of hoverfly that looks like a male bee and is found on every continent except Antarctica.\n\n“ What hoverflies lack in hairiness compared with bees, they make up for in motivation “\n\nHowever, overall, a hoverfly pulls a similar workload to a bee, says Axel Ssymank, an entomologist at the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation. What they lack in hairiness, they make up for in motivation. They visit more flowers within a field and don’t mind working in poor conditions. A recent study conducted in a Japanese pear orchard found that honeybees showed up to pollinate only when it was warm, whereas hoverflies worked regardless of the weather. As a result, hoverflies prove to be great farm workers. Research shows they can be as effective as bees at pollinating a variety of crops, including onions, bok choy, watermelon and caraway, and may even outperform bees on others, such as carrots and strawberries.\n\nHoverflies pollinate 72 per cent of food crops and their larvae devour pests, including on apple trees Neil Phillips/Alamy\n\nBesides, pollination isn’t a zero-sum game. “A flower is able to be pollinated by both bees and hoverflies. They’re sort of complementing each other,” says Ssymank. In fact, a plant is much better off if it is visited by both types of insect, because this ensures that pollination is more complete. “It’s not only the amount of seed production, but also, for example, the quality of fruits that is better,” he says. Take avocados in Australia. Most producers there use managed honeybees to pollinate the crop, but a study earlier this year showed that on fields where common drone flies were released as well, avocado yields almost doubled.\n\nWhat’s more, hoverflies do something else that bees just can’t: they migrate. They do this “to have more sex”, says Hawkes. In the UK, for example, the climate is ideal for hoverfly reproduction during the summer – but “it’s terrible in the winter”, he says, so the insects look for more favourable environments. While doing so, they export up to 19 billion pollen grains out of the UK, carrying these to southern Europe and Africa. Then, on their return, they bring up to 8 billion grains into the country. In a study published in September, a team of researchers observed hoverflies that had landed on a barren oil rig in the North Sea, around 200 kilometres off the coast of Scotland. On average, a single hoverfly carried pollen from eight different plant species.\n\nMass hoverfly migrations\n\nMigrating hoverflies can travel hundreds of kilometres in a single day and their mass movement can be awe-inspiring. In 2017, Hawkes witnessed this for himself as a huge wave of insects came across Col de Bretolet in the Alps. Hawkes had been camping for three months in a mountain hut with no running water or electricity, waiting to witness an insect migration. At around 2pm, there came the buzzing: millions of insects all moving southwards, sweeping right above the grass. “The air was full of glistening yellow and orange hoverflies,” he says. When Hawkes later analysed similar swarms in the Pyrenees, which he says resembled “a living carpet”, he discovered that 90 per cent of the insects were flies, with hoverflies being the most abundant kind.\n\nThere are now 20 radar systems tracking insects on the move across Europe, from the UK and France to Finland and Latvia. Employing data from such systems, scientists have calculated that each year, up to 4 billion hoverflies migrate over southern England, heading north in the spring and south in the autumn. In terms of sheer mass, that’s over seven times more than all the birds journeying over the country. Such long-distance pollination is vital for plants: it can link geographically isolated populations, boost the genetic variety of crops and even help plants adapt to climate change by spreading genes favourable for defending against disease or drought resistance. “These animals are having a real impact on fighting the climate crisis,” says Hawkes.\n\nAll this leaves no doubt that hoverflies are invaluable pollinators. Unfortunately, like many insects, including bees, their numbers are falling. “We have signs that both hoverflies and bees are heavily declining,” says Ssymank.\n\nFor instance, a study using data from 1980 to 2013 in the UK found an average decline of 25 per cent among various bee species, and a 24 per cent drop among hoverflies. In Germany, the numbers are even more troubling: there has been an 80 per cent decrease in hoverfly numbers over the past four decades. And in the Netherlands, the current extinction rate is one species per year – approximately two and a half times faster than the decline in bees. The European Red List of Hoverflies, a report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature that Ssymank worked on, found that of almost 900 European hoverfly species, more than a third are facing extinction.\n\nExtinction risks\n\nSome of the things that threaten hoverflies are the same as those that threaten bees: pollution, pesticides, intensive agriculture and livestock farming. But there are twists in the tale. For one, managed honeybees can themselves spell trouble for hoverflies. “The public has this broad perception that the presence of bees is good, and that’s led to the introduction of colonies where they shouldn’t be,” says Fernández-Grandon.\n\nStudies show, for example, that poorly placed, high-density commercial beehives can spread diseases to wild pollinators – and also outcompete them. When more than 2000 beehives were placed in Teide National Park in Tenerife, the honeybees almost completely drained the nectar from local flowers, leaving little for wild pollinators such as hoverflies to eat. The result was a decline in the park’s biodiversity.\n\nThe second specific challenge for hoverflies is the degradation of habitats for their larvae. Honeybee larvae simply need a hive and flowers to feast on, but hoverflies require a range of environments, from stagnant ponds to compost heaps and rotting wood, as the larvae of many species feed on decaying organic matter. “If you destroy these, you lose the whole hoverfly population,” says Ssymank.\n\nThis is why honeybees can thrive in urban environments, whereas hoverflies don’t. When scientists looked at gardens in and around Malmö, Sweden, for example, they saw that wild bees were doing fine in the inner city, but hoverflies were struggling. Likewise, on 20 “green roofs” planted with vegetation in Antwerp, Belgium, researchers counted almost 600 wild bees from 40 different species, but only 11 individual hoverflies.\n\nHoverflies can be trained to respond to certain flowery scents, which can help make them better pollinators Dr G. Mandela Fernández-Grandon\n\nFortunately, there are solutions to stem the hoverfly decline. One can be found outside Almería, Spain. Since July this year, a start-up there called Polyfly has operated the world’s first industrial plant designed to mass-rear the insects. It doesn’t smell of flowers: the larvae’s food stinks, says Marc Vaez-Olivera, a co-founder of Polyfly, admitting that bad odours are an occupational hazard. Nevertheless, this 5500-square-metre facility is capable of churning out a billion pollinators per year. Refrigerated, the metabolism of the hoverfly pupae slows down, putting them in a sort of suspended animation, and then they can be shipped almost anywhere in the world to be released on crops.\n\nThat’s less bizarre than it sounds: after all, renting out commercial honeybee colonies for pollination is already a common practice. In the US, such services are worth about $300 million per year, and hives get hauled back and forth across the country on trucks. In a single year, hundreds of thousands of such bee colonies are brought to California to pollinate crops such as almonds, apples and blueberries.\n\nThe hoverfly-breeding business is still in its early stages, but there are many challenges: the eggs often don’t hatch and the pollen used to feed reproducing adults is expensive and hard to obtain. Vaez-Olivera says he is optimistic that commercial hoverfly breeding can offer growers a “viable and environmentally sound way to enhance crop yields”. However, if we want to prevent these pollinators’ decline in the wild, we must also protect their habitats, for example by encouraging farmers to grow wildflowers on their fields or plant trees nearby. According to a study in Canada published earlier this year, this can lead to 33 times more hoverflies on crops, compared with fields that are surrounded only by grasses.\n\nHow to help hoverflies\n\nOlder trees, with hollows and deadwood left rotting on the ground, are all the better to feed hoverfly larvae. Likewise, there are big potential benefits from restoring ponds and small streams – features that have been removed from the countryside all too often through drainage and dredging.\n\nIf you have a garden, you too can help protect larval microhabitats. This can be as simple as placing an old, decaying log among your flowers. You may also want to figure out which hoverflies live in your area and find wildflower mixes that work well for them, says Fernández-Grandon. iNaturalist has a website to assist with this. Most hoverflies, for example, enjoy umbrella-shaped members of the parsley family, such as dill, cow and Queen Anne’s lace.\n\nAs Fernández-Grandon trains his hoverflies, he still grapples with the question of how long the insects can remember the lessons taught in the lab. If they can recall a scent long term, that would open up the prospect of training hoverflies from commercial breeding plants to be efficient pollinators of specific crops, like strawberries or melons. Similar training has been done with bees for almost a century. “If they had already learned what they should be looking for, then that could make quite a large difference,” says Fernández-Grandon.\n\nWith bee colonies collapsing, we need all the help we can get to have our crops pollinated effectively. Drone-like hoverflies certainly have what it takes, but with their microhabitats disappearing, it’s a race against time, says Hawkes. However, the fact that people are starting to pay attention to hoverflies, not just bees, gives him hope. “It’s good to not put all your eggs in one basket,” he says.\n\nFernández-Grandon agrees. “We’ve put a bit too much focus on bees.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Bees are well-known for pollinating plants, but their numbers are falling in many places. Meanwhile, hoverflies, insects that look like bees or wasps, also pollinate many crops and help control pests, though they have been less noticed.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists have found ways to train hoverflies to recognize certain flower scents, making them better at pollinating specific crops. A new factory in Spain can now breed hoverflies by the billions to support farms. These insects not only pollinate about 72% of food crops worldwide but their larvae eat harmful pests like aphids, reducing the need for pesticides.\n\n**Impact** – Hoverflies can work in bad weather, travel long distances to spread pollen, and help protect the environment by naturally controlling pests. This makes them very useful for farmers, especially as bee populations decline. Using hoverflies alongside bees improves crop growth and fruit quality. Protecting hoverfly habitats, such as ponds and dead wood, also helps maintain their numbers.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers are exploring how to train hoverflies for long-term memory of flower scents to improve pollination even more. The new breeding facilities will supply farms worldwide, and efforts to restore natural habitats will support wild hoverfly populations. This combined approach may strengthen crop production and reduce reliance on chemicals.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Hoverflies are becoming an important part of farming by pollinating crops and eating pests, offering a promising way to support food production as bee numbers fall.\n",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nWhat started as a modest plan to give Taradell residents space to grow their own vegetables has blossomed into one of Spain’s most promising clean‑energy success stories. The small Catalan town, known for its strong culture of community action, soon saw its early gardening project expand into something much bigger.\n\nFour local activists realized that if Taradell could organize around growing food, it could also organize around generating its own power. They formed Taradell Sostenible, a cooperative now 111 members strong that provides renewable electricity to more than 100 households, including many of the town’s most vulnerable residents.\n\n“The question was how could people with few resources join the co-op when membership costs €100 (about $108 USD),” explained cooperative president Eugeni Vila. “We agreed that people designated as poor by the local authority could join for only €25 (about $27 USD) and thus benefit from the cheap electricity we generate.”\n\nSupported by funding from Spain’s Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy (IDAE), Taradell Sostenible installed solar panels atop a sports center and a cultural building. The projects earned national attention. “We’re very proud of the fact that IDAE describes us as pioneers,” Vila said, crediting NextGenerationEU funds for helping the co-op bring its early ideas to life.\n\nFrom sunshine tax to solar surge\n\nSpain’s renewable energy boom has been a long time coming. A country blessed with abundant sunlight but short on fossil fuels, Spain once lagged on home solar due to the infamous “sunshine tax,” a policy introduced in 2015 that penalized self‑generated solar energy. After the tax was scrapped in 2018, rooftop solar installations soared, growing seventeenfold according to IDAE.\n\nThat policy shift marked a turning point. Today, IDAE is channeling its efforts toward expanding energy communities like Taradell Sostenible. The institute has earmarked €148.5 million (about $160 million USD to support 200 community energy projects nationwide.\n\nEnvironmental experts have pushed for this model for years: harnessing the unused rooftops of warehouses, municipal buildings, and sports centers to power nearby homes and businesses. Recent policy changes, such as expanding the maximum distance for shared community solar from 500 meters to 2,000 meters, have helped the model spread across the country.\n\nTackling fuel poverty, one solar array at a time\n\nIDAE’s renewed strategy has a clear goal: lowering energy costs for households experiencing pobreza energética, or fuel poverty. These families often cannot afford the upfront €5,000-€6,000 ($5,400-$6,500 USD) needed to install home solar systems.\n\nBy building shared, community-owned installations, the burden is lifted from individuals. Cooperatives can produce cheaper, cleaner power for residents who need it most. To strengthen that vision, IDAE encourages co-ops to collaborate, forming networks of autonomous but interconnected groups. Taradell, for example, has partnered with nearby energy communities in Balenyà and La Tonenca.\n\nVila says this collaboration has helped them reach residents who might otherwise fall through the cracks. “We’ve developed a formula to help people who are struggling to get by through incorporating them into a network that helps them to improve their situation,” he explained. Their work has been bolstered by the EU’s Sun4All project, which supported solar initiatives designed specifically for low‑income families.\n\nFrom Catalonia to Galicia: clean energy for island communities\n\nThe movement stretches far beyond Catalonia. On the opposite side of Spain, in Galicia, tiny island communities are also preparing to benefit from IDAE’s support.\n\nThe island of Ons, home to just 92 residents, is set to replace its aging diesel generator with solar power. “With these subsidies, we’re going to install solar panels on the local authority buildings to supply energy to the islanders, most of whom are elderly and vulnerable,” said José Antonio Fernández Bouzas, head of the Atlantic Islands National Park.\n\nNearby, the Cíes Islands already have solar installations powering local businesses, reducing reliance on diesel generators and lowering pollution in these ecologically sensitive areas.\n\nA smarter, more resilient grid\n\nLocal renewable energy does more than lower bills and cut emissions. It also makes Spain’s power system more resilient. The blackout that swept across Spain and Portugal earlier this year exposed the vulnerabilities of a highly centralized grid.\n\nCommunity energy projects that are small, distributed, and deeply rooted in local needs offer a practical path toward preventing future large‑scale outages. They also align with how Spain actually lives; with 65 percent of the population in apartment buildings, rooftop co-ops provide access where individual home solar is not feasible.\n\nA model for an energy future built from the ground up\n\nSpain’s community energy revolution is still young, but its growth is accelerating. What began with four activists in Taradell has become a national movement powered by cooperation, creativity, and a lot of sunlight.\n\n“We’re proud to be pioneers,” Vila said. And across Spain, dozens of other communities are proving that this model that is focused on being local, democratic, and accessible can redefine how a country powers itself.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nFor the first time in at least a quarter century, puffins have appeared on the Isle of Muck in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This triumphant return is a milestone conservationists are calling a powerful sign of recovery. The tiny island, managed by Ulster Wildlife as a protected seabird sanctuary, had not seen evidence of puffin breeding since the charity began overseeing the site 25 years ago.\n\nTheir return follows years of determined restoration work. Invasive brown rats, notorious predators of eggs and chicks, were removed through an eradication program launched in 2017. The team also introduced winter grazing to keep vegetation low, limiting cover for predators.\n\nAndy Crory, Ulster Wildlife’s nature reserves manager, summed up the significance of the moment: “Seabird restoration works.” For him, the return of puffins, once spoken of only in local lore, marks a turning point. “Tales of puffins once breeding on the Isle of Muck felt more like folklore,” he said. “So, while a handful of puffins on a tiny island may seem small, this moment is huge.”\n\nFirst signs of renewal\n\nThe first encouraging glimpse came in 2024, when five puffins were spotted near the island. The evidence grew even stronger this spring. Cameras installed for the rat eradication project captured two puffins repeatedly entering and leaving a nesting burrow on the cliff ledges.\n\nEven more promising was their behavior. The birds were bringing food back to the burrow, a hopeful sign they were rearing a chick. While researchers cannot yet confirm whether they successfully fledged a young “puffling,” Crory remains optimistic.\n\n“Our hope is that the Isle of Muck will become a thriving stronghold for puffins and, in time, tempt back other lost species like the Manx shearwater,” he said. “For now, we’re waiting with great excitement to see if the first ‘pufflings’ appear on the cliffs next summer. That truly would be the icing on the cake.”\n\nA broader comeback for seabirds\n\nThe puffins’ resurgence is part of a larger pattern. Annual surveys are already showing increases in other seabird species on and around the island, including eider ducks, guillemots, herring gulls, and lesser black-backed gulls.\n\nThe success on the Isle of Muck mirrors restoration efforts elsewhere. Across the UK, rat removal programs have helped boost seabird populations under threat from invasive predators. On Rathlin Island, the LIFE Raft project is expected to confirm the successful eradication of rats in its upcoming report. In a world-first achievement, ferrets have also been removed from the island.\n\nWhy puffins matter\n\nPuffins are a priority species in Northern Ireland and red-listed in the UK, the highest category of conservation concern. Their decline has been driven by food shortages, shifting ocean conditions linked to climate change, and predation by invasive species.\n\nUnlike many seabirds, puffins spend most of their lives at sea, only returning to land to nest in spring and summer. They are fiercely loyal to their nesting sites and to each other, returning to the same burrow with the same partner year after year. Each pair raises only one chick per breeding season, making every successful nest vitally important.\n\nA sanctuary with a future\n\nBecause the Isle of Muck is closed to the public, conservationists hope the birds will have a safe, undisturbed breeding season next year. As the restoration work continues to unfold, the puffins’ return stands as a reminder of what is possible when ecosystems are given the chance to heal.\n\nFrom a handful of sightings to the possibility of newborn pufflings, the island’s recovery underscores a simple truth: small interventions can unlock big changes, even for some of the world’s most vulnerable seabirds.\n\nCorrection: A quick note for clarity! This story is about the Isle of Muck in Northern Ireland, not the island of the same name in Scotland’s Inner Hebrides. Thanks to the reader who spotted this and let us know.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Puffins had not been seen breeding on the Isle of Muck in Northern Ireland for at least 25 years. The island is managed as a protected seabird sanctuary by Ulster Wildlife, but invasive predators like brown rats had made it hard for puffins to survive there.\n\n**What happened** – In 2024, after years of efforts to remove rats and manage vegetation, puffins were spotted again on the island. Cameras recorded puffins entering nesting burrows and bringing food, suggesting they may be raising chicks for the first time in decades.\n\n**Impact** – This return shows that careful conservation work can help puffins, a species facing threats like predators and food shortages, come back to places they had left. Since puffins only raise one chick each year and return to the same nests, every successful breeding is very important for their survival.\n\n**What's next step** – Conservationists will watch the island closely next summer to see if young puffins, called pufflings, hatch and leave the nest. They also hope this success will encourage other seabirds to return and inspire similar projects on nearby islands.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The return of puffins to the Isle of Muck after decades shows that removing invasive predators and protecting habitats can help threatened seabird populations recover.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les macareux n’avaient pas été observés en train de se reproduire sur l’île de Muck en Irlande du Nord depuis au moins 25 ans. L’île est gérée comme une réserve protégée pour les oiseaux marins par Ulster Wildlife, mais des prédateurs envahissants comme les rats bruns rendaient leur survie difficile.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – En 2024, après des années d’efforts pour éliminer les rats et gérer la végétation, des macareux ont de nouveau été aperçus sur l’île. Des caméras ont capturé des macareux entrant dans des terriers et ramenant de la nourriture, ce qui suggère qu’ils pourraient élever des poussins pour la première fois depuis des décennies.\n\n**Impact** – Ce retour montre que le travail de conservation permet aux macareux, une espèce menacée par les prédateurs et le manque de nourriture, de revenir sur leurs anciens lieux de vie. Comme les macareux ne nourrissent qu’un poussin par an et reviennent au même nid, chaque reproduction réussie est très importante pour leur survie.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les conservationnistes surveilleront l’île l’été prochain pour voir si des jeunes macareux, appelés pufflings, éclosent et quittent le nid. Ils espèrent aussi que ce succès encouragera d’autres oiseaux marins à revenir et inspirera des projets similaires sur les îles voisines.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le retour des macareux sur l’île de Muck après des décennies montre que l’élimination des prédateurs invasifs et la protection des habitats peuvent aider à restaurer les populations d’oiseaux marins menacées.\n",

      "title": "Tiny Yellowstone quakes ignite a surge of hidden life underground",
      "summary": "Researchers studying Yellowstone’s depths discovered that small earthquakes can recharge underground microbial life. The quakes exposed new rock and fluids, creating bursts of chemical energy that microbes can use. Both the water chemistry and the microbial communities shifted dramatically in response. This dynamic may help explain how life survives in deep, dark environments.",
      "content": "Eric Boyd and his research team investigated how a burst of small earthquakes in 2021 affected the communities of microbes living deep beneath the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field. These microbes inhabit rock and water systems far below the surface, where sunlight never reaches. Instead of relying on photosynthesis, they depend on chemical reactions that occur when water moves through fractured rock. This chemistry provides the energy that supports many forms of underground life.\n\nEarthquakes have the potential to reshape this environment in several ways. Shaking can break open new rock surfaces, force out fluids that were previously sealed away, and redirect the flow of water through the subsurface. Each of these effects can create fresh chemical reactions, which in turn alter the types of energy available to microbial communities. The authors refer to this shift in available resources as a change in the chemical \"menu\" that microbes can draw from.\n\nSampling Yellowstone's Deep Fluids After the Quake Swarm\n\nTo understand how seismic activity influenced this hidden ecosystem, the researchers collected water samples from a nearly 100-meter deep borehole located along the western edge of Yellowstone Lake. They sampled the site five times throughout 2021, giving them a rare look at how conditions changed both immediately and over the following months.\n\nAnalyses of these samples showed notable increases in hydrogen, sulfide, and dissolved organic carbon after the earthquakes. These compounds serve as important energy sources for many subsurface organisms. As the chemistry of the water shifted, the team also detected a rise in planktonic cells, suggesting that more microbes were present in the water column than before. This combination of chemical and biological changes indicates that the quake swarm temporarily boosted the resources available to deep microbial life.\n\nMicrobial Communities in Motion\n\nBeyond detecting an increase in cell numbers, Boyd and colleagues observed that the types of microbes present changed over time. This result stands out because subsurface microbial communities in continental bedrock aquifers are often considered relatively stable. In contrast, the Yellowstone system appeared to respond quickly and noticeably to the pulse of seismic energy.\n\nAccording to the authors, the kinetic energy associated with earthquakes can influence both the chemistry and the biological makeup of aquifer fluids. Their findings imply that even small seismic events can drive meaningful ecological shifts underground.\n\nImplications for Other Worlds With Rock and Water\n\nThe processes observed in the Yellowstone borehole may not be unique. Many regions around the world experience regular seismic activity that could similarly reshape subsurface energy supplies. If this mechanism is widespread, it could help explain how microbial life persists in deep and isolated environments.\n\nThe team also notes that the same basic dynamics might occur on other rocky planets that contain water. If earthquakes or similar geological motions can refresh chemical resources below the surface, this could expand the possible habitats for microbes on worlds such as Mars.",
