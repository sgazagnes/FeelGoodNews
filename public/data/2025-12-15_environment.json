      "title": "A clear new material could make windows super efficient",
      "summary": "MOCHI uses microscopic, air-filled channels to stop heat in its tracks while remaining nearly crystal clear. If scaled up, it could transform windows into powerful energy savers and solar harvesters.",
      "content": "Physicists at the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a new window insulation material that could significantly improve how buildings manage heat around the world. Their creation functions somewhat like a high-tech form of Bubble Wrap, but it is designed for energy performance rather than packaging.\n\nThe material is called Mesoporous Optically Clear Heat Insulator, or MOCHI. It can be manufactured as thick blocks or thin flexible sheets that attach to the interior surface of standard windows. At present, MOCHI is only produced in the laboratory and is not yet available to consumers, but the researchers report that it is durable and nearly completely see-through.\n\nBecause of its clarity, MOCHI maintains an unobstructed view, which sets it apart from many other window insulation products.\n\n\"To block heat exchange, you can put a lot of insulation in your walls, but windows need to be transparent,\" said Ivan Smalyukh, senior author of the study and a professor of physics at CU Boulder. \"Finding insulators that are transparent is really challenging.\"\n\nThe research team published its findings on Dec. 11 in the journal Science.\n\nWhy Window Heat Loss Matters\n\nBuildings of all kinds, from houses to large office towers, account for about 40% of global energy consumption. Much of that energy is wasted as heat escapes to the outdoors during winter or enters buildings during hot weather.\n\nSmalyukh and his collaborators hope MOCHI will slow that unwanted heat flow.\n\nThe new material is a silicone-based gel with a complex internal structure. It contains air trapped within extremely fine pores that are far thinner than a human hair. These microscopic pockets make MOCHI an excellent thermal barrier. In fact, a sheet only 5 millimeters thick is enough to let a person safely hold a flame against it.\n\n\"No matter what the temperatures are outside, we want people to be able to have comfortable temperatures inside without having to waste energy,\" said Smalyukh, a fellow at the Renewable And Sustainable Energy Institute (RASEI) at CU Boulder.\n\nHow MOCHI Controls Light and Heat\n\nSmalyukh described the key to MOCHI's performance as its precisely arranged air pockets.\n\nThe new material shares similarities with aerogels, which are well-known insulators used in many industries. (NASA uses aerogels inside its Mars rovers to keep electronics warm). Aerogels also rely on air-filled pores, but those pores are typically arranged in a random pattern that scatters light. This is why aerogels often appear cloudy and are sometimes referred to as \"frozen smoke.\"\n\nThe CU Boulder team wanted an insulating material that would maintain clarity while providing strong thermal resistance.\n\nTo build MOCHI, researchers combined surfactant molecules with a liquid mixture. These molecules naturally cluster into thread-like shapes, somewhat like the separation that occurs when oil and vinegar form layers in salad dressing. Silicone molecules in the same mixture attach themselves to the surface of those tiny threads.\n\nThrough several controlled steps, the researchers then remove the detergent clusters and replace them with air. This leaves behind a silicone framework surrounding a network of ultra-small, air-filled channels. Smalyukh likens the intricate pattern to a \"plumber's nightmare.\"\n\nAir accounts for more than 90% of MOCHI's volume.\n\nStopping Heat at the Molecular Scale\n\nHeat travels through a gas in a way similar to a billiards-style chain reaction. Energy causes gas molecules and atoms to move faster and collide with one another, passing heat along as they strike.\n\nThe pores inside MOCHI are so tiny that the gas molecules cannot freely collide. Instead, they repeatedly hit the silicone walls, which prevents heat from easily spreading through the material.\n\n\"The molecules don't have a chance to collide freely with each other and exchange energy,\" Smalyukh said. \"Instead, they bump into the walls of the pores.\"\n\nDespite this strong heat blocking ability, MOCHI reflects only about .2% of incoming light, allowing nearly all visible light to pass through.\n\nPotential Uses and Future Development\n\nThe researchers envision many applications for a clear material that effectively traps heat. One possibility is a device that captures warmth from sunlight and converts it into low-cost, sustainable energy.\n\n\"Even when it's a somewhat cloudy day, you could still harness a lot of energy and then use it to heat your water and your building interior,\" Smalyukh said.\n\nFor now, MOCHI is not ready for commercial release. Its laboratory production requires considerable time, although Smalyukh believes that more efficient manufacturing methods can be developed. The components used to make MOCHI are relatively low-cost, which supports the long-term potential for scaling the technology.\n\nFor the moment, the outlook for MOCHI remains promising, much like the clear view through a window coated with this material.\n\nCo-authors of the study include Amit Bhardwaj, Blaise Fleury, Eldo Abraham and Taewoo Lee, all postdoctoral research associates in the Department of Physics at CU Boulder. Bohdan Senyuk, Jan Bart ten Hove and Vladyslav Cherpak, former postdoctoral researchers at CU Boulder, also contributed as co-authors.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Buildings use a lot of energy to keep inside temperatures comfortable. Windows often let heat escape in winter and enter in summer, making it harder to save energy.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists at the University of Colorado Boulder created a new material called MOCHI (Mesoporous Optically Clear Heat Insulator). It is nearly see-through and can be added to windows to stop heat from passing through. MOCHI has tiny air pockets that block heat while letting almost all light shine through. The material is made in the lab but not yet sold to the public.\n\n**Impact** – MOCHI works like a special clear bubble wrap for windows. It keeps buildings warmer in winter and cooler in summer without blocking the view. This could help reduce energy use in homes and offices, which is important because buildings use about 40% of the world’s energy. Unlike other window insulators that look cloudy, MOCHI stays almost completely clear.\n\n**What’s next step** – Researchers want to make MOCHI easier and cheaper to produce so it can be used in real buildings. They also hope it can help capture sunlight to create energy to heat water or rooms. More testing and development will be needed before MOCHI is sold commercially.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – MOCHI is a new nearly invisible window material that blocks heat to save energy and could soon help buildings stay comfortable while using less power.",

      "title": "Scientists finally uncovered why the Indus Valley Civilization collapsed",
      "summary": "A series of century-scale droughts may have quietly reshaped one of the world’s earliest urban civilizations. New climate reconstructions show that the Indus Valley Civilization endured repeated long dry periods that gradually pushed its people toward the Indus River as rainfall diminished. These environmental stresses coincided with shrinking cities, shifting settlements, and eventually widespread deurbanization. Rather than a dramatic collapse, the civilization appears to have faded slowly under relentless climate pressure.",
      "content": "A new study in Communications Earth & Environment reports that a series of major droughts, each extending beyond 85 years, likely played a central role in the eventual decline of the Indus Valley Civilization. This interpretation offers fresh insight into why this influential ancient society, a contemporary of ancient Egypt located near the present-day India-Pakistan border, experienced a slow reduction in its urban and cultural complexity. The research also underscores how long-lasting environmental pressures can shape the development and stability of early civilizations.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was among the earliest known urban cultures, thriving between 5,000 and 3,500 years ago along the Indus River and its tributaries in what is now Pakistan and northwest India. At its height from 4,500 to 3,900 years ago, the society was known for its planned cities, extensive infrastructure, and innovative water management systems. Despite this high level of development, the reasons behind its long, gradual downturn have remained difficult for researchers to fully explain.\n\nClimate Simulations Reveal Temperature Rise and Reduced Rainfall\n\nTo investigate past conditions, Vimal Mishra and colleagues reconstructed climate patterns across the region spanning 5,000 to 3,000 years ago. Their analysis combined climate modeling with several indirect indicators of ancient environmental change. These included the chemical signatures preserved in stalactites and stalagmites from two Indian caves and water level histories recorded in five lakes across northwest India. Together, the data point to a temperature increase of about 0.5 degrees Celsius during this interval, along with a 10 to 20 percent reduction in annual rainfall.\n\nThe team also identified four extended drought periods occurring between 4,450 and 3,400 years ago. Each drought lasted more than 85 years and affected between 65 percent and 91 percent of the area associated with the IVC, indicating widespread and long-lasting impacts on water availability.\n\nShifts in Settlement Patterns During Prolonged Dry Periods\n\nAccording to the authors, these droughts likely influenced where people chose to establish settlements. Between 5,000 and 4,500 years ago, most communities were situated in regions that received higher rainfall. After 4,500 years ago, settlement patterns changed, with populations moving closer to the Indus River. This shift may reflect increasing dependence on a more reliable water source as drought conditions intensified.\n\nOne particularly long drought lasting 113 years, identified between 3,531 and 3,418 years ago, aligns with archaeological evidence of widespread deurbanization in the region. Based on these findings, the researchers conclude that the Indus Valley Civilization did not collapse abruptly from a single climate event. Instead, the society likely experienced a prolonged and uneven decline in which repeated droughts became a significant contributing factor.",

      "title": "Male bonobos use hidden clues to boost mating success",
      "summary": "Male bonobos have an impressive ability to detect when females are most fertile, even though the usual visual cues are unreliable. Researchers tracking wild bonobos in the Congo discovered that males skillfully interpret a mix of swelling timing and a female’s reproductive history to pinpoint the optimal moment for mating. By blending these clues, they overcome nature’s misleading signals and maximize their chances of fathering offspring.",
      "content": "Male bonobos are able to interpret female fertility signals that do not reliably reflect ovulation. This ability lets them direct their mating attempts toward the moments when conception is most likely, according to research led by Heungjin Ryu at Kyoto University, Japan. The work was published December 9th in the open-access journal PLOS Biology.\n\nIn many mammals, females are receptive to mating only when ovulating, which gives males a clear window to maximize reproductive success. Bonobos (Pan paniscus) differ from this pattern because females remain sexually receptive for long periods and develop a bright pink genital swelling that persists well beyond the actual fertile stage.\n\nTracking Wild Bonobos to Understand Fertility Signals\n\nTo examine how males respond to this unreliable signal, researchers observed a wild bonobo community at Wamba in the Luo Scientific Reserve in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The team documented sexual interactions each day and visually assessed the degree of genital swelling in every female. They also collected urine samples on filter paper to measure estrogen and progesterone, allowing them to identify when ovulation occurred.\n\nThe data showed that the likelihood of ovulation was highest between 8 and 27 days after a female reached maximum swelling, a range that makes prediction challenging. Even so, male behavior closely followed the true timing of ovulation. Males focused their mating activity on females who had reached maximum swelling earlier and who had older infants, two indicators linked to a greater chance of ovulation.\n\nFlexible Mating Strategies Maintain an Imperfect System\n\nThese findings reveal that males improve their reproductive success by combining information about swelling patterns with knowledge of a female's reproductive history. Because males are able to estimate fertility reasonably well despite the lack of a precise signal, the researchers suggest there has been little evolutionary pressure to make the signal more accurate. This may help explain why the system has persisted over long evolutionary timescales.\n\nThe authors add, \"In this study, we found that bonobo males, instead of trying to predict precise ovulation timing, use a flexible strategy -- paying attention to the end-signal cue of the sexual swelling along with infant age -- to fine-tune their mating efforts. This finding reveals that even imprecise signals can remain evolutionarily functional when animals use them flexibly rather than expecting perfect accuracy. Our results help explain how conspicuous but noisy ovulatory signals, like those of bonobos, can persist and shape mating strategies in complex social environments.\"\n\nResearchers Reflect on Months of Field Observation\n\n\"The male bonobos weren't the only ones paying close attention to sexual swelling -- we spent countless days in the rainforest at Wamba, DRC doing exactly the same thing! All that watching, sweating, and scribbling in our notebooks eventually paid off. By tracking these daily changes, we uncovered just how impressively bonobos can read meaning in a signal that seems noisy and confusing to us.\"\n\nThis study was supported by the Global Environment Research Fund (D-1007 to TF) of the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (22255007 to TF; and 25304019 to CH;), and the JSPS Asia-Africa Science Platform Program (2012-2014 to TF).
