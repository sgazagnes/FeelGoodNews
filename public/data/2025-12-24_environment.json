      "title": "This fish-inspired filter removes over 99% of microplastics",
      "summary": "Washing machines release massive amounts of microplastics into the environment, mostly from worn clothing fibers. Researchers at the University of Bonn have developed a new, fish-inspired filter that removes over 99% of these particles without clogging. The design mimics the funnel-shaped gill system used by filter-feeding fish, allowing fibers to roll away instead of blocking the filter. The low-cost, patent-pending solution could soon be built directly into future washing machines.",
      "content": "Wastewater from washing machines is widely seen as a major source of microplastics -- tiny plastic particles suspected of harming both people and animals. To help reduce that pollution, researchers at the University of Bonn have created a new filter based on a natural model: the gill arch system in fish. In early tests, the patent-pending device removed more than 99 percent of plastic fibers from washing machine wastewater. The findings were published in the journal npj Emerging Contaminants.\n\nA washing machine used by a four-person household can generate up to 500 grams of microplastics each year, largely due to fibers wearing off textiles during washing. That makes everyday laundry one of the most important sources of these particles. Today, much of that material ends up in the sewage sludge produced at wastewater treatment plants. Because this sludge is often applied as fertilizer, the fibers can ultimately be spread onto fields.\n\nWhy existing washing machine filters fall short\n\nBecause of the scale of the problem, many manufacturers have been looking for ways to remove microplastics from wash water before it reaches the environment. \"The filter systems available so far, however, have various disadvantages,\" explains Dr. Leandra Hamann from the Institute for Organismic Biology at the University of Bonn. \"Some of them quickly become clogged, others do not offer adequate filtration.\"\n\nHamann, working with her doctoral supervisor Dr. Alexander Blanke and other colleagues, turned to biology for ideas. The team focused on fish that act as expert natural filters -- the result of hundreds of millions of years of evolution.\n\nSome fish feed by filtering water, including mackerel, sardines, and anchovies. They swim with open mouths and capture plankton using their gill arch system. \"We took a closer look at the construction of this system and used it as the model for developing a filter that can be used in washing machines,\" says Blanke, who is a member of the transdisciplinary research areas \"Life & Health\" and \"Sustainable Futures\" at the University of Bonn.\n\nHow fish gills inspired a self-cleaning filter design\n\nOver time, these fish evolved a strategy similar to cross-flow filtration. Their gill arch system forms a funnel that is widest at the mouth and narrows toward the gullet. The funnel's walls are formed by branchial arches, which include comb-like structures. Those structures are covered in tiny teeth, creating a mesh stretched across the arches.\n\n\"During food intake, the water flows through the permeable funnel wall, is filtered, and the particle-free water is then released back into the environment via the gills,\" explains Blanke. \"However, the plankton is too big for this; it is held back by the natural sieve structure. Thanks to the funnel shape, it then rolls towards the gullet, where it is collected until the fish swallows, which empties and cleans the system.\"\n\nThat same idea helps prevent clogs. Instead of slamming directly into a flat barrier, particles move along the surface and are guided onward toward the gullet. The approach is also highly efficient, since it removes almost all plankton from the water. A washing machine microplastic filter needs both strengths: strong capture and resistance to blockage. To build a version for laundry, the researchers recreated the gill arch system and tested different mesh sizes and funnel opening angles.\n\nTest results, manufacturing costs, and microplastic removal\n\n\"We have thus found a combination of parameters that enable our filter to separate more than 99 percent of the microplastics out of the water but not become blocked,\" says Hamann. The team reached that result by combining lab experiments with computer simulations. Because the nature-based design avoids complicated moving parts, it should be inexpensive to produce.\n\nCaptured microplastics collect at the filter outlet and are suctioned away several times per minute. Hamann, who has since moved to the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, says the collected material could be pressed inside the machine to squeeze out remaining water. The resulting plastic pellet could then be removed every few dozen washes and thrown away with general waste.\n\nPatents, industry hopes, and health concerns\n\nThe University of Bonn team and the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety, and Energy Technology UMSICHT have already applied for a patent in Germany, and EU-wide patenting is now in progress. The researchers hope manufacturers will refine the design and build it into future washing machines. That could reduce the spread of textile-based microplastics, at least to some extent. The need is pressing: analyses suggest these particles may cause serious health harm. They have already been detected in breast milk and in the placenta -- and even in the brain.\n\nParticipating institutions and funding\n\nIn addition to the University of Bonn, the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety, and Energy Technology UMSICHT contributed to the study. Funding came from the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) and the European Research Council (ERC). Support for protecting and marketing the invention is being provided by the Transfer Center enaCom at the University of Bonn in close cooperation with PROvendis GmbH, a service provider for the NRW university network for knowledge and technology transfer \"innovation2business.nrw.\"",

      "title": "How lab-grown lichen could help us to build habitations on Mars",
      "summary": "Scientists cultivating partnerships of fungi and algae believe their invention has far-out implications for how we create the buildings of the future",
      "content": "Dr Klaus Schmitt\n\nWhen I usually examine lichens, I am in a forest, peering at frilly growths on tree branches with my hand lens. Or on exposed rocks high in the Alps, or old gravestones, or the rocky seashore, in the zone where the seaweed stops growing but before bigger land plants take over. I have been looking at a lot of lichens during research for a book on symbiosis, but where I have never seen them before is in a lab flask swirling in an incubator. And while I often think about what lichens tell us about the past, I hadn’t until recently thought about what they tell us about the future.\n\nThe green cloudy fluid I am looking at in the incubator is not at all what we think of as a lichen, which is a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and an alga. “That’s because this is a synthetic lichen,” says Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, who is the director of the Bezos Center for Sustainable Protein here at Imperial College London. The fluid is a co-culture of two species, a fungus (yeast) and a cyanobacterium. Like a natural lichen, the fungus provides a scaffold, a host structure for the bacterium, and the bacterium makes sugars through photosynthesis using light, water and carbon dioxide, and feeds them to the fungus.\n\nWhy on earth would you want to make such a potion? Because, Ledesma-Amaro tells me, we can gene-edit yeast to get it to create all sorts of useful products – food, fuels, chemicals, materials, pharmaceuticals – and if we can drive that production through photosynthesis, then we can make those things sustainably. For that reason, synthetic lichens are sparking excitement not only in the biotech industry but also beyond it. Lichens, it transpires, could be harnessed to repair buildings, fight the climate crisis and even build habitations on Mars.\n\n“Synthetic lichens recreate the symbiosis of natural lichens, but grow much faster, and using yeast as a partner allows us to sustainably produce a whole range of high-value compounds,” says Ledesma-Amaro. Yeast is a well-known, industrialised organism that is “programmable” and easily grown at scale. In the synthetic lichen I see, Ledesma-Amaro and his team use yeast that is genetically engineered to make caryophyllene, a compound that has applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and fuel industries. In the near future, he foresees a range of useful products: antibiotics, biofuels and synthetic palm oil. Another form of synthetic lichen might be engineered to capture and store carbon dioxide. Other scientists see lichens being deployed to repair ageing concrete structures around the world. The ambitions for lichens are high, even reaching beyond our own planet. On the moon and on Mars, NASA and private space companies plan to use synthetic space lichen – properly known as an engineered living material – to grow on regolith and make material for constructing buildings and furniture.\n\nLiving together\n\nModest in appearance and slow in growth, lichens are the archetypal demonstration of symbiosis, which means “living together” and refers to the cohabitation of two different species. In the case of lichen, the textbook explanation is that a fungal partner hosts an individual of another species, known as the photobiont. Usually, this is algal, but sometimes bacterial, and it makes food through photosynthesis and shares it with its host. The fungal partner provides, among other things, superb protection from the elements, such that the lichen can survive in extreme conditions where little else can make a living. This is why some scientists are repurposing lichens and making synthetic versions of their own.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nLichens have two qualities in their favour. First, as a symbiotic organism, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. In other words, each lichen can do things that the fungus alone or the photobiont alone cannot do. From afar, lichens may be modest in appearance, but up close, they are complex, luxuriant, charismatic organisms. Natural lichens are also far more than the textbook two-species partnership of fungus plus alga. Often, there are these two organisms, plus a secondary fungus in the form of yeast and an extra bacterial species, making a community of four. But even that is an underestimate. “In nature, what we call a ‘lichen’ colloquially is actually a community of many – tens to hundreds – of different microbes,” says Arjun Khakhar, a biologist who makes synthetic lichens at Colorado State University. “Two lichens that look identical and are right next to each other can have hugely different members.” Various analyses of fresh lichen tissue have found that they contain between 1 million and 100 million bacteria per gram.\n\nThe second thing lichens have going for them is that they are robust. They can live and photosynthesise in the harshest of conditions. In Svalbard, far within the Arctic circle, there are around 700 species of lichen. They cope with low temperatures, aridity and high ultraviolet radiation. On the seashore, they tolerate repeated immersion in saltwater – an experience that most other land plants can’t cope with. Some species grow inside rock (“endolithic” lichen, literally “inside rock”). It is an open question as to just what aspect of their biology allows them to cope with desiccation and extreme temperatures.\n\nLichens, which naturally thrive in a variety of environments, are a unique lifeform, made from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a partner like algae or cyanobacteria Jose B. Ruiz/naturepl.com\n\nIn Colorado, Khakhar suggests lichens’ resilience comes from biomolecules the filamentous fungus produces, which protect the entire community in the lichen. “The unique molecules it is able to make are potentially due to lichens’ capacity to leverage both bacterial and fungal biochemistries via distributing tasks across the community,” he says. For example, components in the photobionts can make various pigments with chlorophyll, and the fungus can make sunscreen by synthesising compounds such as carotenoids (the pigments in carrots, ripe tomatoes and autumn leaves) and melanins (which colour our skin). Together, the symbiotic lichen community has access to a greater range of compounds than a single organism can hope to produce, and this unlocks the lichen’s superpower. Physically, too, the fungal component helps buffer the community from swings in temperature and humidity. Then there’s its slow growth, which allows it to live with minimal resources.\n\nLichens in space\n\nThese attributes have been enough to get NASA excited. Lichens can survive exposure to both simulated and real space conditions. Starting in 2014, a lichen species called Circinaria gyrosa lived – or at least, didn’t die – on a shelf on the exterior of the International Space Station for 18 months. When it was brought back inside and given water, it started growing. The fact that lichens can grow inside rock and tolerate the conditions of space excites proponents of lithopanspermia, the idea that microbes could travel between planets in asteroids.\n\nCongrui Jin, an engineer specialising in living materials at Texas A&M University, started thinking about the potential of lichens for a forward-thinking NASA project aimed at finding efficient ways to build places to live and work on Mars – whenever we eventually get there. Some proposals for off-planet housing rely on inflatable structures, the idea being that fewer materials are needed to make air-filled housing. But every item of prefabricated material transported there by rocket is still expensive. A cheaper alternative to hefting such items up from Earth is to find a way to produce building materials from the regolith already on the planet. For Jin, lichens are the perfect solution. But a naturally occurring species may not necessarily work.\n\nAn experiment aboard the International Space Station has shown that lichens can be extremely hardy, surviving for more than 18 months in space ESA\n\n“We want to pair the fungi with some photosynthetic species like cyanobacteria. They can convert sunlight and water into organic nutrients and precipitate calcium carbonate,” she says. “It acts as glue to bind the soil particles on Mars into a cohesive structure.” This biomaterial can then be used in a 3D printer to produce building materials – floors, partitions, walls, furniture, you name it. The bulk of what you need, whether sunlight, carbon dioxide, water, nutrients or vast supplies of basalt rock, is already there on Mars.\n\nJin’s work has recently shown that lichens are promising candidates for turning Mars regolith into building material and for producing other biominerals and biopolymers. Lichens are tough, and some eager futurists consider them good candidates for helping to terraform the Red Planet. But even if there weren’t planetary protection measures to abide by, lichens can’t grow on the surface of Mars, exposed to the elements. Mars has no magnetic field, and any life on the surface needs to be shielded from the harsh radiation. So, Jin envisions her Mars lichens growing in shelters.\n\nThe future of building\n\nHowever, colonising other planets is a long way off, and Jin realised her lichens had a more immediate role on Earth. There are many occasions when it would be useful to bind rubble together and make a usable building material. Think about the wrecked buildings left by natural and human-caused disasters. As well as that, a way to sequester carbon during the concrete-making process would help moderate its huge carbon footprint. And what if we could produce self-healing concrete? Buildings and structures would be cheaper to maintain and would have a longer life, too. Previous attempts to use microbes to perform these functions have faltered because concrete is an inhospitable place in which to live. But if lichens can cope in space, Jin reasoned, surely they can cope with concrete.\n\nJin and her colleagues showed that a lichen-based approach, pairing fungi with cyanobacteria, makes a co-culture that can grow on concrete. Not only that, her synthetic lichen precipitates calcium carbonate – the mineral that forms chalk, limestone and marble – healing cracks in the structure. “We tried filamentous fungi and cyanobacteria and found that they have better survivability [than other microbes] under the dry and nutrient-poor conditions in concrete,” she says. “They get along with each other and the process is autonomous, and they also have [a] very good capability to precipitate calcium carbonate.” Unlike single-species approaches, the co-culture doesn’t require the addition of external nutrients, because the synthetic lichen extracts nitrogen from the air and makes its own fertiliser.\n\nKhakhar is also attempting to make fast-growing lichen by selecting microbes that are already fast growers, before tweaking them and pairing them to become lichen-like. His lab, in work similar to Jin’s, has made a synthetic lichen in which the fungal component becomes mineralised. “Filamentous fungi are fed by the cyanobacteria embedded in them and grow a mycelium that has a stone exoskeleton,” he says. “In the future, this will enable the sustainable biomanufacture of building materials.” He calls the engineered product mycomaterials.\n\nMy investigations of symbiosis have deepened my appreciation of lichens as dynamic mini ecosystems, a living lesson in the reality of interdependence, as has understanding their sci-fi potential in crafting the materials of tomorrow. So the next time you see those frilly growths on a tree, a gravestone or an old bench, perhaps take a moment to pause – and consider what a future-shaping marvel you are beholding.",

      "content": "For decades, climate action skeptics have waved a tired argument: you can’t grow the economy and cut carbon emissions at the same time. But a new report suggests that narrative may be heading for retirement. In fact, a global shift is well underway, and it’s flipping that assumption on its head.\n\nAccording to fresh data from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), more countries than ever are growing their economies while shrinking their carbon footprints. And no, it’s not just a fluke or a one-off COVID blip. It’s a real, sustained trend.\n\nDrawing on the 2025 Global Carbon Budget and a newly refined classification system, the report examined 113 countries covering more than 97 percent of global GDP and 93 percent of emissions. Based on this, researchers are concluding that decoupling is now the “norm, not the exception.”\n\n“We’re sometimes told that the world can’t cut emissions without cutting growth,” said John Lang, one of the report’s authors and Net Zero Tracker Lead at ECIU. “The opposite is happening.”\n\nWhat exactly is decoupling?\n\nLet’s break it down. Decoupling refers to breaking the historic link between economic growth and rising emissions. It comes in two main flavors:\n\nAbsolute decoupling: emissions go down while GDP goes up. This is the gold standard.\n\nemissions go down while GDP goes up. This is the gold standard. Relative decoupling: emissions still rise, but slower than GDP.\n\nThere’s also recoupling, which is the less ideal scenario where emissions and GDP both rise, or worse, emissions rise while GDP falls. Thankfully, that’s getting rarer and usually pops up during major economic shocks (such as the pandemic years).\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has historically called global-scale absolute decoupling “controversial.” But this new analysis suggests that it’s not just possible, it’s already happening, and at a growing pace.\n\nWho’s walking the decoupling talk?\n\nBetween 2015 and 2023, nearly half of the global economy (46 percent of GDP) achieved absolute decoupling. That’s a whopping 38 percent increase compared to the decade before the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn total, 92 percent of the global economy and 89 percent of global emissions are now found in countries that have either relatively or absolutely decoupled.\n\nThe ECIU sorted countries into three categories:\n\nConsistent decouplers: Nations that achieved absolute decoupling both before and after the Paris Agreement.\n\nNations that achieved absolute decoupling both before and after the Paris Agreement. Improvers: Countries that didn’t manage it before 2015, but did between 2015 and 2023.\n\nCountries that didn’t manage it before 2015, but did between 2015 and 2023. Reversals: Places that had previously decoupled but have since backslid.\n\nEurope leads the decoupling charge\n\nUnsurprisingly, Europe is doing much of the heavy lifting. The list of consistent decouplers includes a solid lineup: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK, among others.\n\nNotably, this report used consumption-based emissions data, meaning it accounted for carbon footprints of imported goods, not just what’s emitted domestically. That sidesteps the common criticism that wealthy countries just “offshore” their emissions by outsourcing production.\n\nSome countries made solid progress post-2015, like Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and Greece, earning them the title of “improvers.” Meanwhile, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia slipped into the “reversal” camp.\n\nAnd yes, some of the biggest emissions drops in proportional terms happened in Western Europe, including Norway, Switzerland, and the UK.\n\nNet zero is more than a climate goal—it’s an economic strategy\n\nThe decoupling trend isn’t just good climate news but a powerful economic signal. According to Gareth Redmond-King of ECIU, the clean energy sector is already outpacing the fossil fuel industry in global employment, while net zero industries are growing three times faster than the economy overall.\n\n“The momentum built by the Paris Agreement is unstoppable,” Redmond-King said, adding that net zero remains the “only solution to halting ever more costly and dangerous impacts.”\n\nEven with global emissions still rising, albeit more slowly, the report’s authors argue that the underlying structural change is unmistakable. And with more countries joining the decoupling club, the once “controversial” idea of green growth is now grounded in evidence.\n\nA climate myth bites the dust\n\nThe old assumption that climate action must come at the expense of economic growth is looking increasingly outdated. While challenges remain and not every country is hitting absolute decoupling just yet, the overall trajectory is clear.\n\nMore economies are proving that it’s entirely possible to scale up prosperity while scaling down emissions. And that might be one of the most hopeful climate shifts we’ve seen in a long time.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – For many years, people have believed that countries cannot grow their economies without increasing carbon emissions, which cause climate change. This idea has made some hesitate to take strong climate actions.\n\n**What happened** – A new report from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) studied 113 countries and found that almost half of the global economy grew while reducing emissions between 2015 and 2023. This means many countries are now able to increase wealth without increasing pollution.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it shows the old belief that economic growth and cutting emissions can’t happen together is wrong. Europe leads the way, with countries like Germany, France, and the UK showing steady progress. The report also used data that counts emissions from imported goods, proving countries are not just moving pollution elsewhere.\n\n**What's next step** – More countries can learn from these examples and work to grow their economies in cleaner ways. The clean energy sector is already creating more jobs than fossil fuels, and industries focused on net zero emissions are growing faster than the overall economy. This trend is expected to continue.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Many countries are now proving it’s possible to grow their economies while cutting carbon emissions, challenging old ideas about climate and growth.\n",

      "content": "Introduction\n\nThe Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project represents a strategic initiative designed to address critical satellite data needs identified by federal agencies. Established in 2021 by the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), OPERA responds to priorities identified by the Satellite Needs Working Group (SNWG), an interagency body convened by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). SNWG surveys federal agencies every two years to determine their top satellite data needs. This article summarizes OPERA, including its mandate, and then presents a case study demonstrating how the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is using OPERA to monitor agricultural health in the Midwestern United States.\n\nOPERA Mandate and Approach\n\nThe core mandate for the OPERA project lies in its commitment to delivering data products in formats that are immediately usable and analysis-ready. Rather than providing raw satellite data that requires extensive processing expertise, OPERA transforms complex satellite observations into standardized, accessible products that federal agencies can quickly integrate into their existing workflows to support national security, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and infrastructure management. This approach eliminates the technical barriers that often prevent agencies from effectively using satellite data, allowing them to focus on their mission-critical applications rather than data processing challenges.\n\nTo achieve this goal at the scale required by federal agencies, OPERA has developed a sophisticated cloud-based production system capable of generating data products efficiently and consistently to meet the dynamic needs of federal users. As of 2025, OPERA has successfully released dynamic surface water extent, surface disturbance, and surface displacement data through various NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). The vertical land motion product will be OPERA’s next offering beginning in 2028 – see Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.

To illustrate this goal, OPERA’s 5th Annual Stakeholder Engagement Workshop detailed real-world applications of this approach on Sept. 11, 2025.\n\nCase Study: Harnessing OPERA Data to Map Crop Health in Midwest United States\n\nWhen water lingers on farmland, the consequences often ripple outward, resulting in crop losses, changes in soil health, and shifting carbon storage. In the rolling landscape of central Iowa’s South Fork watershed, these challenges are a daily reality for farmers, researchers, and crop insurance companies. To address these concerns, scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture–Agriculture Research Service’s (USDA–ARS) National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment (NLAE) are partnering with NASA’s OPERA project.\n\nUsing OPERA’s Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWx) and Surface Disturbance (DIST) product suites, USDA–NLAE researchers began the process of identifying depressions where water consistently ponds across fields – see Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. The map of maximum inundation combines individual Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWx) granules acquired over a month. Figure credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech, Dr. Renato Prata de Moraes Frasson\n\nThese sites are often more than nuisance puddles; they signal areas of reduced yield, risk for crop mortality, and hotspots for carbon and nutrient accumulation. By combining OPERA’s cloud-free, high-resolution mosaics with field-based measurements from USDA and university partners, the joint OPERA-NLAE team is producing actionable maps that pinpoint waterlogged zones – see Figure 3. Farmers can use these maps to improve soil health and guide land-management decisions.\n\nFigure 3. The map depicts a field south of Iowa Falls in Hardin County, IA. The pixels are color-coded to indicate the number of times a region is inundated with water from May through October 2024. Larger numbers are associated with deeper depressions and with perennial lakes and rivers, including the Iowa River flowing west to east in the northern part of the image. Figure credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech, Dr. Renato Prata de Moraes Frasson\n\nThe OPERA products also support broader watershed management. Analyses of river migration, oxbow lake formation, and storm damage from powerful Midwestern derecho events show how OPERA data extend beyond field plots to larger areas. By detecting both persistent inundation and shifts in vegetation health, DSWx and DIST together provide synergistic information identifying areas where improved tile drainage may result in better crop health and increased yields. This approach can also be used to mitigate topsoil erosion and nutrient transport to control the development of harmful algal blooms and the occurrence of anoxic zones with implications far beyond the Mississippi Delta.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe use of OPERA data by USDA–ARS to map and monitor crop health in the Midwest United States highlights how this vital data product bridges the gap between Earth science and agricultural resilience. The outcome of this collaboration underscores OPERA’s mission – translating cutting-edge satellite observations into usable tools that support farmers, improve soil and water conservation, and strengthen the resilience of U.S. agriculture. This collaboration signifies the mandate of OPERA as an SNWG solution provider to fulfill the observation needs of federal users. All OPERA’s data products are freely available to the public from various NASA DAACs and are discoverable from the NASA Earthdata Search platform. The team welcomes direct engagement with individual federal, state, academic, and commercial stakeholders and can be reached via opera.sep@jpl.nasa.gov.\n\nSteven K.
