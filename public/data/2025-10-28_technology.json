      "title": "A matrix-confined molecular layer for perovskite photovoltaic modules",
      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 27 October 2025; doi:10.1038/s41586-025-09785-3A matrix-confined molecular layer for perovskite photovoltaic modules",
      "content": "Metal halide perovskites with remarkable optoelectronic properties have become a competitive candidate for supporting the efficiency progression of photovoltaics. As the latest record on power conversion efficiency (PCE) of research-cells being comparable to the commercialized silicon cells1-3, the industrialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is on the horizon4,5. Most high-efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells using self-assembled molecules (SAMs) face the challenges due to their aggregation and hydrophobicity. Here we report a “SAM-in-matrix” strategy to distribute partial SAMs into a stable matrix of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, which could break the original molecular stacking-induced aggregation. 2D lattice Monte Carlo simulation and experimental results reveal that such strategy can form efficient charge transport channels. This SAM-in-matrix hole transport layer (HTL)-based devices demonstrate universally higher efficiencies for various SAMs with compact surface coverage, decent conductivity, and greatly reduced buried nanovoids. Moreover, this strategy shows prominent applicational potential for scalable production. The SAM-in-matrix HTL on FTO/NiO x substrate facilitates the formation of large-area perovskite films with good crystalline quality and enhanced conductivity of NiO x . 1 m × 2 m large-area perovskite solar module is thus achieved with a certified record efficiency of 20.05%.",

      "personality_title": "New molecular layer boosts efficiency of large perovskite solar modules",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Perovskite solar cells are a promising new type of solar technology that can convert sunlight into electricity. They have been improving quickly and might soon compete with the silicon solar panels commonly used today.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists developed a new method called the “SAM-in-matrix” strategy. This mixes special molecules called self-assembled molecules (SAMs) into a stable material to stop them from clumping together. This helps electricity flow better inside the solar cells. Using this method, they built a large solar module (1 meter by 2 meters) that reached a certified efficiency of 20.05%, which is as good as many silicon panels.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it shows perovskite solar modules can work well even when made in large sizes, which is needed for real-world use. The new molecular layer improves the way electricity moves inside the cells and helps produce better quality films. This could make it easier and cheaper to produce efficient solar panels on a big scale.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers plan to use this method to make even bigger solar panels and improve their durability. This could lead to more affordable and effective solar energy solutions becoming widely available.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new molecular layer design has helped create large perovskite solar panels that match the efficiency of traditional silicon ones, advancing clean energy technology.\n",

      "content": "These robots can clean, exercise - and care for your elderly parents. Would you trust them to?\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Pallab Ghosh Science Correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nListen to Pallab reading this article Hidden away in a lab in north-west London three black metal robotic hands move eerily on an engineering work bench. No claws, or pincers, but four fingers and a thumb opening and closing slowly, with joints in all the right places. \"We're not trying to build Terminator,\" jokes Rich Walker, director of Shadow Robot, the firm that made them. Bespectacled, with long hair and a beard and moustache, he seems more like a latter-day hippy than a tech whizz, and he is clearly proud as he shows me around his firm. \"We set out to build the robot that helps you, that makes your life better, your general-purpose servant that can do anything around the home, do all the housework...\" But there's a deeper ambition: to address one of the UK's most pressing challenges - the escalating crisis in social care.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Pepper, this small humanoid robot, has led exercise classes with residents of one care home\n\nThere were 131,000 vacancies for adult care workers in England, a report by charity, Skills for Care, found last year. And in all, around two million people aged 65 and over in England are living with unmet care needs, according to Age UK. By 2050, one in four people in the UK expected to be aged 65 or over, potentially putting more strain still on the care system. Which is where robots come in. The previous government announced a £34m investment in developing robots that could potentially be used to give care. It went as far as saying, in 2019, that \"within the next 20 years, autonomous systems like… robots will become a normal part of our lives, transforming the way we live, work and travel.\" Could this \"techno-solutionism\" - which sounds more like something out of a sci-fi film - really be the solution? And would you really trust your elderly relatives, or yourself when you're at your most vulnerable with what is essentially a very strong machine?\n\nWorkouts with Pepper the robot\n\nJapan offers a peek into a future with robots living among us. Ten years ago, its government began offering subsidies to robot manufacturers to develop and popularise the use of robots in care homes - fuelled in part by an ageing population and relative lack of care home staff. Dr James Wright, an AI specialist and visiting professor at Queen Mary University of London, spent seven months observing them. And specifically, looking at how well they worked in a Japanese care home. In all, three types of robots were studied: the first, called HUG, was designed by Fuji Corporation in Japan and looked like a highly sophisticated walking frame. It had support pads that people could lean right into, and it helped carers lift people from bed to, say, a wheelchair or the toilet.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images Nursing-care robot HUG, by Fuji Corporation in Japan, was designed to help carers lift people\n\nThe second, meanwhile, looked a bit like a baby seal and was called Paro. This robot, intended to stimulate dementia patients, was trained to respond to being stroked through movements and sounds. The third was a small friendly-looking humanoid robot called Pepper. It could give instructions and also demonstrate exercises by moving its arms - and was used to lead exercise classes in the care home. Even before he started observing them, Dr Wright had bought into the hype a little. \"I was expecting that the robots would be easily adopted by care workers who were massively overstretched and extremely busy in their work. \"What I found was, almost the opposite.\"\n\nGetty Images Pepper could give instructions and demonstrate exercises by moving its arms - but some people who tried it out found its voice too high pitched\n\nHe discovered that, in fact, the biggest drain on the time of care home staff was cleaning and recharging the robots - and above all troubleshooting when they went wrong. \"After several weeks the care workers decided the robots were more trouble than they were worth and used them less and less, because they were too busy to use them,\" he tells me. \"HUG had to be moved around all the time to get [it] out of the residents' way. Paro caused distress to one of the residents who had become overly attached to it. And they couldn't follow Pepper's exercise routines because it was too short for people to see - and they couldn't hear it properly because its voice was too high-pitched.\"\n\nThe The Washington Post via Getty Images Paro looks like a baby seal and is intended to respond through movements and sounds to being stroked\n\nThe teams behind the robots had their own responses to Dr Wright's research. The developers behind HUG says that since then they've refined the design to make it more compact and user-friendly. Paro's creator Takanori Shibata said that Paro has been used for 20 years and pointed to trials that demonstrated \"clinical evidence of [the] therapeutic effects\". Pepper is now owned by a different company and its software has been substantially updated. And yet the study was not without merit. Mr Walker of Shadow Robot is adamant that the use of robots in care should not be dismissed. For one thing, he argues, the next generation of them will be much more capable.\n\nFrom labs to the real world\n\nPraminda Caleb-Solly, a professor at the University of Nottingham is determined to make these robots work well in practice. \"We are trying to get these robots out of the labs into the real world,\" she says. To do this she has set up a network, Emergence, to help connect robot makers with businesses and individuals who will use them - and to find out from elderly people themselves that they'd want from robots. The answers vary. Some people have said they want robots with voice interaction and, understandably, a non-threatening appearance. Others want a \"cute design\". But many requests come down to the practical way they'd like the robot to adapt to their changing needs - and for the robot to charge and clean itself. \"We don't want to look after the robot – we want the robot to look after us,\" said one person who was asked the question.\n\nCaremark Caremark has been trialling Geni - a small voice-activated robot\n\nSome businesses in the UK are testing out robots too. Home care provider, Caremark has been trialling Geni, a small voice-activated robot, with some people who use their services in Cheltenham. One man who has early-onset dementia explained he enjoyed asking Genie to play Glenn Miller songs. Overall, however, reactions have been \"like Marmite,\" according to director Michael Folkes – with some people living Geni, and others less complimentary. But Mr Folkes also stresses these devices aren't about replacing people. \"We're trying to build a future where carers have more time to care.\"\n\nRobot hands: learning from evolution\n\nBack in the laboratory of the Shadow Robot Company in London, Rich Walker points out another big challenge: mastering the perfect robotic hand. \"For the robot to be useful, it needs to have the same ability to interact with the world as [a] human does,\" he explains. \"And for that it needs human-like dexterity.\"\n\nGetty Images The previous government announced a £34m investment in developing robots that could potentially give care amongst other things\n\nThe robot hand Mr Walker shows me certainly seems nimble. It's made from metal and plastic, and fitted with 100 sensors, with the dexterity and strength of a human hand. Each finger moves to touch its thumb smoothly, quickly and precisely, finishing with an 'OK' to sign off. It can even do a Rubik's Cube, one-handed. Yet it is still a long way from doing the more delicate tasks, like using a pair of scissors or picking up smaller, more fragile objects. \"The way we use a pair of scissors is quite mind-blowing when you think about it,\" Mr Walker says. \"If you try and analyse what happens, you're using your sense of touch in subtle and precise ways and receiving feedback, which makes you adjust the way you cut. How do you tell a robot how to do that?\"\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images 'For the robot to be useful, it needs to have the same ability to interact with the world as [a] human does. And for that it needs human-like dexterity'\n\nMr Walker's team, together with 35 other engineering firms, are working to design a hand more like ours - it's part of what's known as the Robot Dexterity Programme. It's one of the projects run by a government agency called the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) that sets out to support scientific research that is high risk (because it might well not work) but also high-reward for its potential to transform society. The project's leader, Professor Jenny Read, explains they are looking at how animals move as part of this, to better inform the design not only of the hand but to inform a complete rethink of how robots are made. \"One of the very striking things about animal bodies is their grace and efficiency, evolution has ensured that, in fact. \"I think gracefulness really is a form of efficiency.\"\n\nReplicating human muscles\n\nGuggi Kofod, an engineer turned entrepreneur from Denmark, is trying to develop artificial muscles for robots that can be used instead of motors. His Denmark-based firm, Pliantics, is at an early stage of development, but have made the key breakthrough of finding a material that seems to do the job and is durable. He is driven by deeply personal reasons too. \"Several people near me died from dementia very recently,\" he explains. \"I see from the people who are caring for dementia patients, and it is very challenging. \"So, if we could build systems that help them to not be scared, and that help them live at least a decent level of life… That's incredibly motivating for me.\"\n\nThe muscles his firm designs are made from a soft material that extends and contracts, much like real muscles, when an electric current is applied. Guugi Kofod is working with Shadow Robot, as part of the ARIA project to develop a robotic human-sized hand whose artificial muscles could give it a more precise and delicate grip. The ultimate aim is for it to detect small pressure changes when it grips an object, and to know when to stop squeezing, just as the skin on fingertips does.\n\nWhat robots mean for carers\n\nDr Wright, who observed the robots in Japan, has one final concern. That is, if they catch on, robots could end up making life worse for human carers. \"The only way that economically you can make this work is to pay the care workers less and have much larger care homes, which are standardised to make it easy for robots to operate in,\" he argues. \"As a result, there would be more robots taking care of people, with care workers being paid a minimum wage to service the robots, which is the opposite of this vision that robots are going to give time back to care workers to spend quality time with residents, to talk.\" The debate: Are facial recognition cameras in shops a step too far? Other experts are more positive. \"It's going to be a huge industry, given the deficit we have in the workforce right now. The demand for carers as our population ages will be huge,\" argues Gopal Ramchurn, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Southampton. He is also CEO of Responsible AI, which is involved in trying to ensure that artificial intelligence systems are safe, reliable, and trustworthy. But he cites Elon Musk's Optimus humanoid robot, which served drinks and mingled at a Tesla event last year, as a sign that - like it or not - the robots are coming. \"We are trying to anticipate that future, before the big tech companies come in and deploy these things without asking us what we think about them,\" he adds. So now is the time to develop the right regulations to ensure that the robots work for us, he argues, rather than the other way round. \"We need to be ready for that future.\"\n\nAdditional reporting: Florence Freeman.

      "title": "Ancient tides may have sparked humanity’s first urban civilization",
      "summary": "New research shows that the rise of Sumer was deeply tied to the tidal and sedimentary dynamics of ancient Mesopotamia. Early communities harnessed predictable tides for irrigation, but when deltas cut off the Gulf’s tides, they faced crisis and reinvented their society. This interplay of environment and culture shaped Sumer’s myths, politics, and innovations, marking the dawn of civilization.",
      "content": "A newly published study is reshaping how scientists understand the rise of urban civilization in ancient Mesopotamia. The research suggests that the emergence of Sumer, often called the cradle of civilization, was not solely the result of human ingenuity but also of powerful natural forces. According to the authors, the interaction between rivers, tides, and shifting sediments at the northern edge of the Persian Gulf played a defining role in shaping the world's first urban centers.\n\nPublished in PLOS ONE, the paper Morphodynamic Foundations of Sumer was led by Liviu Giosan, Senior Scientist Emeritus in Geology & Geophysics at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), and Reed Goodman, Assistant Professor of Environmental Social Science at the Baruch Institute of Social Ecology and Forest Science (BICEFS) at Clemson University. Their work builds on years of collaborative research through the Lagash Archaeological Project, which brings together Iraqi archaeologists and the Penn Museum at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWater Shaped Early Agriculture and Society\n\nThe researchers present a new paleoenvironmental model showing that tidal rhythms influenced the earliest stages of agriculture and social organization in Sumer. Rather than being shaped only by river floods, the region's growth was tied to predictable tidal patterns that provided both water and fertile soil.\n\n\"Our results show that Sumer was literally and culturally built on the rhythms of water,\" said Giosan. \"The cyclical patterns of tides together with delta morphodynamics -- how the form or shape of a landscape changes over time due to dynamic processes -- were deeply woven into the myths, innovations, and daily lives of the Sumerians.\"\n\nSumer, located in southern Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), is widely recognized as one of humanity's earliest civilizations. It produced many firsts, including writing, the wheel, and large-scale agriculture. The region's city-states -- Ur, Uruk, and Lagash among them -- developed complex political and religious systems that became the blueprint for later societies.\n\nThe new research indicates that between 7000 and 5000 years ago, the Persian Gulf extended much farther inland than it does today. Twice each day, tidal surges carried freshwater deep into the lower Tigris and Euphrates. Early farmers likely took advantage of this consistent flow by digging short canals to irrigate fields and date groves, allowing for productive farming without massive irrigation projects.\n\nWhen the Tides Receded, Civilization Transformed\n\nOver time, sediment carried by rivers built deltas at the head of the Gulf, cutting off tidal access to inland areas. This environmental shift, the authors suggest, caused widespread ecological and economic challenges. The loss of tidal waters may have forced Sumerian communities to respond with large-scale irrigation and flood control systems -- innovations that defined Sumer's golden age.\n\n\"We often picture ancient landscapes as static,\" says Goodman. \"But the Mesopotamian delta was anything but. Its restless, shifting land demanded ingenuity and cooperation, sparking some of history's first intensive farming and pioneering bold social experiments.\"\n\nBeyond environmental change, the researchers link these watery origins to Sumer's cultural identity. The study connects the region's flood myths and water-centered deities to the landscape itself, suggesting that Sumerian religion evolved from their intimate relationship with tides and rivers.\n\n\"The radical conclusions of this study are clear in what we're finding at Lagash,\" adds Holly Pittman, Director of the Penn Museum's Lagash Archaeological Project. \"Rapid environmental change fostered inequality, political consolidation, and the ideologies of the world's first urban society.\"\n\nReconstructing a Lost Landscape\n\nUsing environmental and geological data, sediment samples from Lagash, and high-resolution satellite imagery, the team recreated what Sumer's coastline once looked like. Their reconstruction offers a window into how early societies adapted to dramatic changes in their environment and how these challenges spurred innovation.\n\n\"Our work highlights both the opportunities and perils of social reinvention in the face of severe environmental crisis,\" concluded Giosan. \"Beyond this modern lesson, it is always surprising to find real history hidden in myth -- and truly interdisciplinary research like ours can help uncover it.\"\n\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (NOSAMS), the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), and the Penn Museum. Additional support for Giosan came from STAR-UBB and ICUB in Romania. Goodman completed his portion of the work as part of his postdoctoral studies at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University.",

Until now, most people thought these achievements were mainly the result of human ideas and effort.\n\n**What happened** – New research shows that natural forces, especially the daily tides from the Persian Gulf, played a big role in Sumer’s rise. Scientists studied soil, water patterns, and satellite images to find that early farmers used the regular tides to water their crops. Later, when sediment built up and blocked the tides, the people of Sumer had to create new irrigation systems and ways to control floods. This change helped shape their society, politics, and even their stories about gods and floods.\n\n**Impact** – This study is important because it shows how nature and human culture worked together to start civilization. It explains that the environment wasn’t just a background but an active part of how people lived and invented new things. The findings also connect Sumer’s myths about water to real changes in their land, giving us a clearer picture of how early cities grew and adapted.\n\n**What’s next step** – Researchers can now use this information to better understand other ancient societies and how they responded to environmental changes. This approach may help archaeologists find more clues about the past by looking closely at nature’s role in history. It also encourages teamwork between scientists from different fields to learn about human origins.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The rise of Sumer’s first cities was closely tied to ancient tides, showing how early humans adapted to and shaped their changing environment.",

      "content": "If we admit that quantum numbers are the true essence of reality – not particles, space or time – then a surprising and beautiful new vision of reality opens up to us\n\nSkizzomat\n\nMany have pinpointed the birth of quantum mechanics to the small, treeless island of Helgoland, where a young Werner Heisenberg went in the summer of 1925. There, he sketched out the basics of what would become our most brilliant and successful way of explaining reality. At the heart of his approach was the decision to focus exclusively on what observers would find when they measured particles.\n\nIt was a flash of genius – but it has also tied physicists up in knots for 100 years. Much of the trouble comes down to questions about what an observer is and what exactly constitutes an observation. Are we to believe that reality is somehow contingent on us looking at it?\n\nI believe it is now time to move on from this metaphysical mess. I have thought about quantum theory for much of my career and I have come to believe we don’t need observers – it makes no sense to talk about them. There is a much more consistent and reasonable way to describe the quantum world that I would like to share with you now, together with the three clinching experiments that can prove my case.\n\nWhile this framework, in my opinion, makes a lot of logical sense, it takes us into unfamiliar territory. It’s not just observers that don’t exist – there are no particles either. And space and time? Well, we will get to them. These are deep waters, to be sure, but it is worth wading in because, as we do so, we find clues to what might lie beyond quantum theory as we know it.\n\nTo begin with, let’s take a whistle-stop tour of modern physics and the spider’s web of problems it creates. Observers were a key tenet of physics long before quantum mechanics: indeed, they played a crucial role in Albert Einstein’s development of both special and general relativity. The latter theory says that space and time are melded together in the fabric of space-time, and it is the bending of this fabric that creates gravity. I will challenge this view later, but one implication of the original idea is that observers in places where the curvature of space-time is different will experience time passing at different relative speeds.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Lost in Space-Time Untangle mind-bending physics, maths and the weirdness of reality with our monthly, special-guest-written newsletter. Sign up to newsletter\n\nWhen we teach relativity, we often talk about observers in this way, imagining them as people. But the truth is that the time experienced by any moving object (even, say, an atom) will change with respect to objects in differing gravitational fields. These differences needn’t be recorded by observation, so we don’t need a special category of “observers”.\n\nTeachers of physics often talk about “observers”, but they may ultimately be a misleading concept Titipong Makkarach/Getty Images\n\nGeneral relativity is the first of the two pillars of modern physics, the other being quantum theory itself. The essence of the theory is that reality is divided into discrete chunks at the most fundamental level. For example, when atoms take in or spit out energy, it happens in packets of a certain size, not continuously. But observers are baked into quantum theory too, because it distinguishes between particles before and after “observation”. Beforehand, we describe them using the wave function, an equation that sets out a range of possible properties – a superposition. Afterwards, this is said to “collapse” into a specific value.\n\nThe trouble is, this gives rise to all sorts of questions, the most basic of which is how and why collapse happens. It also creates paradoxes, such as Wigner’s friend, dreamed up decades ago by physicist Eugene Wigner. He imagined a “friend” inside a sealed lab making a quantum measurement while he himself waited outside. The problem comes when we compare the two people’s descriptions of reality. Wigner hasn’t observed anything, so the whole lab is described by the fuzzy wave function. Yet, for his friend, there is a definite outcome. With this paradox, Wigner was asking how we know when an observation becomes definitive.\n\nSome physicists think we need to tweak quantum theory to deal with all this. But not me. To explain how I think about it, we need to grasp the phenomenon of entanglement, which Erwin Schrödinger called quantum theory’s “characteristic trait”. Quantum entanglement is often seen as mysterious, but it is really just a special link between two quantum objects such that when you measure one, you immediately know something about the other’s properties. Here’s the key point: when we talk about “observations”, what we are really referring to, in my opinion, is the moment two systems become entangled with each other. Although the thing that gets entangled can be a person – an “observer” – it doesn’t have to be.\n\nLet me give you an example. There is a famous experiment in which a particle of light, or photon, in superposition goes through two slits in a screen at the same time, creating an interference pattern when it hits a second screen. But if we observe which slit the photon goes through, then no interference takes place. Before you conclude that our observation collapses the superposition, bear in mind that if we entangle anything else with the photon in a way that reveals which slit it takes, we get the same effect.\n\nSo we should stop talking about “observers” and instead talk about entanglement. By the way, this view dissolves the question Wigner raised with his paradox, too. There is no “ultimate” observer – there are no observers at all. What really happens is that the system and observer (just another system) become entangled.\n\nWhat I would like you to take from all this is that quantum theory already contains everything we require to understand reality. We only need to take its full implications seriously – even if they appear strange. So, let us now explore where that takes us, starting with a central idea in physics: particles.\n\nThe unreality of particles\n\nTo grapple with this concept, the first things we need to deal with are fields. A field is an entity that exists everywhere and changes over time, an idea originally introduced by Michael Faraday in the first half of the 19th century. In classical electromagnetic field theory, the electric and magnetic field values are ordinary (or classical) numbers called c-numbers, as in 5 metres. Each point in space has three electric field numbers and three magnetic field numbers assigned to it.\n\nIn quantum theory, we instead talk about quantum fields where every point in space is described not by single numbers, but instead tables of numbers. These tables are called quantum numbers or q-numbers. This is why many people take Heisenberg’s 1925 paper as the beginning of quantum physics: he was the first to propose upgrading the positions and momenta of particles to q-numbers. This difference between c-numbers and q-numbers is simple but profound – we will come back to it later.\n\nHowever, not everyone is prepared to take seriously the full implications of quantum fields. When physicists took the classical electromagnetic field and quantised it, this implied the field could oscillate in more modes than was previously possible. In the quantum field, there are four of these modes and the theory predicts that the field should be able to manifest as particles, in this case photons, in each one. But here’s the weird thing: we can only ever detect photons in two of these modes. The other two cancel out and aren’t detectable, even in principle. These “ghost” photons are therefore unobservable yet unavoidable.\n\nPhilosophically troubling? Perhaps. But this isn’t unusual. Much of science works this way. We postulate things because the explanatory power of a theory would fall apart without them.\n\nI don’t think we should sweep these oddities under the table, but should embrace them. Chiara Marletto, my colleague at the University of Oxford, and I have suggested that even though these ghosts can’t be directly detected, they should get entangled with electrons under certain circumstances and this entanglement could, in principle, be detected. As we set out in a 2023 paper, you could do this by putting an electron into a superposition, whereupon, if we are right, it should get entangled with the ghosts, and this would be detectable with the right kind of careful measurement. It is a challenging experiment, but certainly one that lies within the reach of existing technology. It would be a quantum equivalent of seeing a ghost.\n\nVlatko Vedral working on an entanglement experiment in the lab Sunny Tiwari\n\nWhat would it mean if this experiment showed that these ghosts can be entangled, as I fully expect it would? The most basic thing we normally think of as capable of being entangled is a particle. But ghosts can’t truly be considered particles. All they are, in truth, is q-numbers in an equation. But that, for me, is precisely the point. It is the q-numbers that are fundamental, not the human conception of a “particle”. It just so happens that particles have q-numbers, and that has misled us into thinking the former are the fundamental elements of reality, when it is actually the latter.\n\nThere is another layer of sophistication that reinforces my argument that particles aren’t real. Let’s consider an individual particle, say an electron. In the language of vanilla quantum theory, we would say that, before we measure this particle, it is in a superposition of states. It is both here and there, and both possibilities are described by q-numbers. But now change your perspective. If q-numbers are the essence of reality, these two q-numbers can be entangled with each other. Put another way, you might say that a particle in superposition can be “entangled with itself”.\n\nNot all physicists would accept this is possible, but more than 15 years ago, I proposed an experiment that can determine the truth, this time with my colleague Jacob Dunningham, now at the University of Sussex, UK. Take a single particle and make its state delocalised, so that it is in a superposition of two different physical locations. To experimentally verify whether the superposition is entangled, you need to make separate measurements in the two different locations and check if they violate an equation called Bell’s inequality, the hallmark of entanglement.\n\nThere is already some evidence that this single-particle entanglement occurs. Experiments conducted by Björn Hessmo at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and his colleagues in 2004 showed that individual photons split between two positions do violate Bell’s inequality. Photons, in other words, aren’t fundamental elements of reality – it is their q-numbers that matter. Still, photons are massless and no one has yet done this with an object with mass, such as an atom or even a much lighter electron, because those experiments are challenging. But there is no doubt in my mind that the outcome would be the same.\n\nAre space and time real?\n\nNow we are ready to talk about space and time. Some people think of this as the last frontier of physics, and it is related to the field’s biggest open problem, namely that of combining those two pillars of physics, general relativity and quantum theory, into a theory of quantum gravity. Since I have so far argued that we should think of everything as being made up of q-numbers, you might anticipate that space and time should be quantum too. Indeed, many researchers think this.\n\nBut here I take a more radical view: space and time don’t exist at all. Like “observers”, they are convenient labels – bookkeeping devices – but there are no physical entities corresponding to them. Therefore, quantising gravity doesn’t mean quantising space-time, it means quantising the gravitational field (upgrading Einstein’s c-numbers into q-numbers) in the same way that other fields are quantised.\n\n“ I take a more radical view: space and time don’t exist at all “\n\nThis might seem a subtle point. After all, in general relativity, the gravitational field is thought of as being nothing more and nothing less than bending space-time. But this is where I put a twist on things: what bends isn’t space or time, but fields like the electromagnetic field that holds all matter together. Atoms, molecules, clocks and rulers are all bound by electromagnetism. The job of the gravitational field is to couple to these fields and tell them how to bend. For convenience, we talk about these fields being laid across an invisible grid we call space-time. That’s fine, but let’s not fool ourselves into thinking space-time is fundamental.\n\nSome of my colleagues may consider this pretty extreme, and I admit it is hard to think of any experiment at present that could prove I am right. But for me, this is all part of taking quantum theory at face value. I am suggesting that gravity should be just like any other quantum field.\n\nAlong with space, time and observers, it seems that particles may not be a fundamental ingredient of reality Pete Godfrey/Unsplash\n\nSo: no particles, no space, no time. Instead, I think the basic ingredient of nature is the q-number. To finish, let’s explore how fully embracing this principle might lead us towards new insights. What I am about to say brings to mind the story of when philosopher Bertrand Russell had a cosmology lecture interrupted by an attendee who claimed that the universe is carried on the back of a gigantic cosmic turtle. When Russell asked her what the turtle stands on, she replied: “It’s turtles all the way down!” My proposal is similar, although no turtles are involved.\n\nWhen we talk about how quantum fields interact, we use a piece of mathematics called the quantum Hamiltonian. It has long bothered me that these Hamiltonians mix q-numbers with ordinary c-numbers – for example, physical constants such as the speed of light or the electron charge. This is routine, but it doesn’t seem right to me. Over the past century or so, physicists took classical equations and made some bits of them quantum. But wouldn’t it be neater, and in the spirit of the philosophy I have been espousing, if our equations were quantum through and through?\n\nI’m not the first to think like this. In the 1980s, physicist David Deutsch proposed eliminating c-numbers altogether, making all the quantities in quantum Hamiltonians into q-numbers. Doing this, however, would have strange consequences. Let’s take just one of the possibilities and look at the speed of light, which we currently treat as a simple c-number. If we turned this into a q-number – which, remember, always describes a point in a quantum field – this would imply that there is some new quantum field connected to the speed of light. It would be a bit like what happened when we quantised the electromagnetic field and got those pesky ghosts, a suggestion that there is more to reality than we thought.\n\nThis general idea can be subjected to experiment. If there are extra quantum fields out there, particles should be capable of becoming entangled with them. Imagine, for example, you maximally entangle an atom and a photon. If there is another field out there that mediates this interaction, it should join the party and create a three-body entangled system. The result would be that the strength of the entanglement between the photon and the atom would be weaker than expected. In 2022, Jim Franson at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, proposed one method for detecting this entanglement – it is conceptually quite similar to the experiment I imagined for detecting the ghosts. No one has performed this so far, but it is technologically possible.\n\nIn principle, we could imagine taking quantisation to an even deeper level. Q-numbers are tables of numbers, and you could easily “upgrade” all of the ordinary numbers in those tables to be q-numbers themselves – and then do the same again. Tables of tables of tables. In this view, it isn’t turtles, but rather q-numbers, all the way down.\n\nPhilosophers hate infinite regress. But nature is under no obligation to respect our philosophical scruples. The universe may simply be a bottomless pit, offering physicists an inexhaustible supply of mysteries.",
