      "title": "EVs are already making your air cleaner",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "The logic behind electric vehicles benefiting public health has long been solid: More EVs means fewer internal combustion engines on the road, and a reduction in harmful tailpipe emissions. But now researchers have confirmed, to the greatest extent yet, that this is indeed what’s actually happening on the ground. What’s more, they found that even relatively small upticks in EV adoption can have a measurably positive impact on a community.\n\nWhereas previous work has largely been based on modeling, a study published this month in the journal Lancet Planetary Health used satellites to measure actual emissions. The study, conducted between 2019 and 2023, focused on California, which has among the highest rates of EV use in the country, and nitrogen dioxide, one of the gases released during combustion, including when fossil fuels are burned. Exposure to the pollutant can contribute to heart and lung issues, or even premature death. Across nearly 1,700 ZIP codes, the analysis showed that, for every increase of 200 electric vehicles, nitrogen dioxide emissions decreased by 1.1 percent.\n\n“A pretty small addition of cars at the ZIP code level led to a decline in air pollution,” said Sandrah Eckel, a public health professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine and lead author of the study. “It’s remarkable.”\n\nThe group had tried to establish this link using Environmental Protection Agency air monitors before, but because there are only about 100 of them in California, the results weren’t statistically significant. The data also were from 2013 through 2019, when there were fewer electric vehicles on the road. Although the satellite instrument they ultimately used only detected nitrogen dioxide, it did allow researchers to gather data for virtually the entire state, and this time the findings were clear.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\n“It’s making a real difference in our neighborhoods,” said Eckel, who said a methodology like theirs could be used anywhere in the world. The advent of such powerful satellites allows scientists to look at other sources of emissions, such as factories or homes, too. “It’s a revolutionary approach.”\n\nMary Johnson, who researches environmental health at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and was not involved in the study, said she’s not aware of a similar study of this size, or one that uses satellite data so extensively. “Their analysis seems sound,” she said, noting that the authors controlled for variables such as the COVID-19 pandemic and shifts toward working from home.\n\nThe results, Johnson added, “totally make sense” and align with other research in this area. When London implemented congestion pricing in 2003, for example, it reduced traffic and emissions and increased life expectancy. That is the direction this latest research could go too. “They didn’t take the next step and look at health data,” she said, “which I think would be interesting.”\n\n\n\nDaniel Horton, who leads Northwestern University’s climate change research group, also sees value in this latest work. “The results help to confirm the sort of predictions that numerical air quality modelers have been making for the past decade,” he said, adding that it could also lay the foundation for similar research. “This proof of concept paper is a great start and augurs good things to come.”\n\n\n\nEckel hopes that, eventually, advances in satellite technology will allow for more widespread detection of other types of emissions too, such as fine particulate matter. That could even help account for some of the potential downsides of EVs, which are heavier and could therefore kick up more tire or brake dust than their gasoline counterparts. On the whole, though, she believes the picture overwhelmingly illustrates how driving an electric car is better not just for the planet but for people.\n\nResearch like this, she says, underscores the importance of continued EV adoption, the sales of which have slumped recently, and the need to do so equitably. Although lower-income neighborhoods have historically borne the brunt of pollution from highways and traffic, they can’t always afford the relatively high cost of EVs. Eckel hopes that research like this can help guide policymakers.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\n“There are concerns that some of the communities that really stand to benefit the most from reductions in air pollution are also some of the communities that are really at risk of being left behind in the transition,” she said. Previous research has shown that EVs could alleviate harms such as asthma in children, and detailed data like this latest study can help highlight both where more work needs to be done and what’s working.\n\n“It’s really exciting that we were able to show that there were these measurable improvements in the air that we’re all breathing,” she said. Another arguably hopeful finding was that the median increase in electric vehicle usage during the study was 272 per ZIP code.\n\nThat, Eckel says, means there is plenty of opportunity to make our air even cleaner.\n\nCorrection: This story originally misidentified the pollutant studied. It is nitrogen dioxide.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Electric vehicles (EVs) have been known to reduce pollution because they don’t produce harmful exhaust like gasoline cars. However, most previous studies used computer models instead of real measurements to show this effect.\n\n**What happened** – A new study published in 2024 used satellite data to measure pollution from 2019 to 2023 across California. Researchers looked at nitrogen dioxide, a harmful gas from car engines, and found that for every 200 more electric cars in a ZIP code, nitrogen dioxide levels dropped by 1.1 percent.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first large study to use satellites to prove that even small increases in electric car use can clean the air. Cleaner air means fewer health problems like lung and heart diseases for people living nearby. The study also shows that this method can be used in other places to track pollution better than before.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists hope to use satellites to monitor other types of pollution, like tiny particles from tires and brakes. The research also encourages more people to buy electric cars, especially in neighborhoods that suffer the most pollution but might not afford EVs yet. Policymakers could use this information to help make cleaner air available to everyone.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Using satellites, researchers confirmed that more electric cars on the road are already helping reduce harmful air pollution in California communities.\n\n",

      "content": "Overall, the EIB invested a “record” amount of 100 billion in 2025, above the 89 billion in 2024, and plans to maintain this volume also in 2026.\n\nBrussels – The European Investment Bank (EIB) invested 13.8 billion euros in Spain in 2025, the highest figure among European Union countries and almost 14% of the total 100 billion in financing channeled by the public bank, in line with the percentage of the previous year.\n\nOf this investment, 2.9 billion euros came from post-pandemic recovery funds that were transferred to the Spanish economy through the EIB, which partly explains why Spain is at the top in financing, according to the 2025 results published today by the institution.\n\n“2025 has been a record year for the EIB in Spain for two fundamental reasons. One, the strength and dynamism of the Spanish economy, which has a demand for investment in high-quality projects. And secondly, due to a situation that will not continue indefinitely (…) which is the implementation of the Next Generation EU loans,” said EIB President Nadia Calviño in statements to the press.\n\nThese loans from the post-Covid recovery fund began to be channeled in 2025 through the EIB in the different Autonomous Communities, added the former vice president of the Spanish Government, who considered that “it is too early to know how business will develop in 2026” in Spain.\n\nBehind Spain are France, the second-largest recipient in absolute terms with 13.121 billion euros, including 121 million in recovery funds; Italy (12.343 billion euros, of which 343 million are post-Covid funds), Germany (10.4 billion), Poland (8 billion euros) and the Netherlands (4.1 billion).\n\nIf the contribution from the recovery fund is not taken into account, Spain would rank as the third-largest beneficiary behind France and Italy, according to EIB data, which will present the country results for each financing area in Spain on February 9.\n\nRecord figure in 2025\n\nOverall, the EIB invested a “record” amount of 100 billion in 2025, above the 89 billion in 2024, and expects to maintain this volume also in 2026, Calviño explained at a press conference.\n\nAlmost 60% (57 billion euros) of the total went to “green” projects and, within this category, a “record” volume of 11.6 billion euros was dedicated to energy grids and storage which, according to EIB estimates, will help build or upgrade 56,000 kilometers of energy lines, including the Bay of Biscay interconnector between the Iberian Peninsula and France.\n\nLast year the institution also launched the TechEU technology and innovation investment program, with which it has already invested 22.4 billion and expects to mobilize at least 250 billion by 2027.\n\nDefense and housing\n\nThe main change was, however, the increase in investment allocated to security and defense, which quadrupled to 4 billion euros, above the target set after the EIB agreed to expand the projects eligible to receive funds.\n\nWith this, the institution has reached the goal it had set for 2026 of allocating 5% of total investment to this area, and Calviño said that, although it is too early to anticipate how investments and contracts will evolve, she does not rule out that this target may be revised upwards.\n\nProjects in this area include military fields, research and development in radar and aviation systems, sensors for the protection of underwater assets, security infrastructure or space capabilities, among others.\n\nIn terms of housing, the EIB managed to mobilize 5 billion through its Affordable and Sustainable Housing Plan, particularly for innovation, renovation and new buildings, almost 50% more than the previous year and an amount the bank plans to increase.\n\n“We expect to continue on this upward path also in 2026,” said Calviño, who stressed that Spain is one of the “main markets” in which the EIB is operating, with “important projects in Barcelona” and innovation projects that are experimenting with new materials and in housing renovation.\n\nLikewise, last year the EIB allocated 16 billion euros in guarantees and equity financing for small businesses and start-ups through the European Investment Fund, its venture investment subsidiary; as well as 9 billion to investments outside the EU.

Improved ice models are also useful for navigational safety, like when ice-breaking ships clear frozen waterways.\n\n“Usually it’s the scientists putting data out to the public, and this time, we’re asking the public to give feedback to the scientists so they can improve the models,” said Shelby Brunner, science and observations manager at GLOS.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist.

Data collected by the public can be submitted online as long as there’s ice to measure, and stipends are available to participants.\n\nRecreation aside, the Great Lakes also make up the region’s largest source of fresh water — more than 30 million people rely on the Great Lakes for drinking water, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nBrunner said the data from last year showed researchers that ice is more variable than they initially predicted.

That means there are years with very little ice or years with a lot of it — as of January 28, 38 percent of the Great Lakes had iced over this winter, higher than the historical average at this time of year.\n\n“We don’t get to go back in time and measure the past. We have to measure it now and keep it safe. So we can use it for reference for how things are looking in the future,” Brunner said.\n\nIt’s not just ice fishers contributing data. Mandi Young, a science teacher in Traverse City, took her middle school students out last year to measure ice thickness on Cedar Lake, a long, narrow lake adjacent to Grand Traverse Bay popular for boating and fishing.\n\nYoung has her students regularly collect information from the water, like its temperature or depth, to compare with previous years. Ice thickness was another data point they could add to the mix, she said.\n\n“The students really love it. They get the chance to be outside. They know that their information is being saved and used by other community members,” Young said.\n\nYoung plans to have her students measure ice thickness again this winter. This time, they have an auger to drill holes into the icy lake.\n\nShe said one of her favorite parts is the questions students ask while they’re out taking measurements: “Could we throw a rock on it? Will it break? Oh, what about throwing ice on ice, what’s gonna happen? Oh, did you hear that sound?”\n\n“Kids just get curious about ice,” she said.\n\nThe data they collect from inland lakes like this one will be kept for archives and used in future research, Brunner, the scientist, said. She hopes citizen scientists see the benefit in contributing data that could help the many people, from ice fishers and ship captains to researchers, who spend time on the ice.\n\n“Our job is to collect information that’s relevant now, but also make sure we do our due diligence and make it useful in the future,” she said.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists want to better understand how thick the ice is on the Great Lakes and nearby lakes during winter. This information is important because ice thickness affects safety for people on the ice and helps improve forecasts about ice conditions.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from the Great Lakes Observing System (GLOS) in Michigan started a citizen science program asking people in the region to measure ice thickness and share their data online. This program is now in its second year, and it encourages anyone who spends time on frozen lakes to contribute measurements. Even middle school students are involved, using tools like augers to drill into the ice.\n\n**Impact** – Measuring ice thickness by hand gives scientists information satellites cannot provide. The data helps improve models that predict ice conditions, which is important for public safety, shipping, and understanding climate change effects. For example, last year’s data showed ice thickness varies more than expected, highlighting the need for more measurements. The Great Lakes supply drinking water to over 30 million people, so knowing ice conditions helps protect this vital resource.\n\n**What's next step** – The program will continue collecting data this winter and hopes to involve more people. The information gathered will be stored for future research and used to make ice forecasts safer and more accurate. Scientists want citizen scientists to keep sharing photos and measurements to improve understanding of changing ice patterns.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – People across the Great Lakes region are helping scientists measure ice thickness to improve safety and understand how climate change affects winter ice.\n",
