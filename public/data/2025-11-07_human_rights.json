The Statewide Treaty Bill sets up a democratically elected body to represent First Nations people in Victoria and advise the state government on laws and policies impacting their rights and interests.Victoria’s treaty is the first of its kind in Australia. Unlike other Commonwealth countries, Australia has never entered into treaties with Indigenous people. When Britain first made contact in 1788, the British crown denied First Nations ownership of the land under the doctrine of terra nullius— “land belonging to no one”—which was used to justify violent dispossession and colonization.The treaty acknowledges that First Nations people have lived in balance with the land for at least 60,000 years and rejects terra nullius, stating: “The fiction of ‘land belonging to no one’ ignored those already here.”Under the law, a new representative body called Gellung Warl “gives effect to the right to self-determination and will play a central part in the democratic life of the state.” It will also include truth-telling and accountability bodies to ensure the government upholds existing commitments to reduce Indigenous disparities.In 2025, Victoria’s Yoorrook Justice Inquiry, which was Australia’s first formal Indigenous-led truth-telling inquiry, determined that the decimation of First Peoples in Victoria constituted genocide. First Nations people in Australia continue to be subject to systemic discrimination. They are hugely overrepresented in Australia’s prisons and are over 12 times more likely to have their children removed by child protection authorities than non-Indigenous people.Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Australia is party, all peoples have the right to self-determination, including to freely determine their political status and pursue their economic, social, and cultural development. Australia also endorsed the 2009 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which sets out minimum standards for the rights and well-being of Indigenous peoples.Several UN rights experts have said that the protection of Indigenous peoples’ rights also requires transitional justice measures to effectively address legacies of gross violations of human rights as a form of recognition, reparation and reconciliation.”The treaty is an important step toward upholding the right to self-determination in Victoria, but it needs to jumpstart efforts at the national level to right historical and ongoing wrongs against First Nations people throughout the country. Australia’s federal government should respond to First Peoples’ claims with necessary institutional reforms.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In Australia, Indigenous peoples, called First Nations people, have never had a formal treaty with the government. When Britain arrived in 1788, it claimed the land was empty, ignoring the long history and rights of these peoples.\n\n**What happened** – On October 30, 2024, the state of Victoria passed a new law to create the country’s first treaty with First Nations people. This law also sets up a group called Gellung Warl, which will be elected by Indigenous people to represent their interests and advise the government on important decisions.\n\n**Impact** – This treaty is the first in Australia and officially recognizes that First Nations people have cared for the land for over 60,000 years. It rejects the old idea that the land belonged to no one. The treaty also includes plans for truth-telling and holding the government accountable to reduce unfair treatment of Indigenous people, who still face major challenges like higher rates of imprisonment and family separation.\n\n**What's next step** – The treaty starts a new chapter in Victoria but also encourages the whole country to make changes. Experts say Australia’s federal government should create more reforms to fix past and present wrongs against First Nations people.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Victoria’s new treaty law marks Australia’s first official recognition of Indigenous rights and sets up a representative body to ensure their voices shape the future.\n\n",

Lorsque les Britanniques sont arrivés en 1788, ils ont prétendu que la terre était vide, ignorant l’histoire et les droits de ces peuples.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Le 30 octobre 2024, l’État de Victoria a adopté une nouvelle loi pour créer le premier traité du pays avec les peuples des Premières Nations. Cette loi met aussi en place un groupe appelé Gellung Warl, élu par les autochtones pour représenter leurs intérêts et conseiller le gouvernement.\n\n**Impact** – Ce traité est le premier en Australie et reconnaît officiellement que les Premières Nations prennent soin de la terre depuis plus de 60 000 ans. Il rejette l’ancienne idée que la terre n’appartenait à personne. Le traité prévoit aussi des mesures de vérité et de responsabilité pour réduire les traitements injustes envers les autochtones, qui font face à des problèmes importants comme des taux élevés d’emprisonnement et de séparation familiale.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Ce traité ouvre un nouveau chapitre dans l’État de Victoria, mais encourage aussi tout le pays à faire des changements. Les experts disent que le gouvernement fédéral australien doit créer plus de réformes pour réparer les torts passés et présents envers les Premières Nations.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – La nouvelle loi sur le traité de Victoria marque la première reconnaissance officielle des droits autochtones en Australie et crée un organe représentatif pour faire entendre leur voix dans l’avenir.\n\n",

Los expertos dicen que el gobierno federal de Australia debe crear más reformas para corregir errores pasados y presentes contra los pueblos de las Primeras Naciones.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – La nueva ley del tratado de Victoria marca el primer reconocimiento oficial de los derechos indígenas en Australia y crea un cuerpo representativo para asegurar que sus voces influyan en el futuro.\n\n",

The organizations submitted a joint briefing urging the commission to prioritize reforms that enable a durable, rights-based peace.Parliament established the National Solidarity, Sisterhood/Brotherhood and Democracy Commission in August, 2025 after the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK’s) announced its intention to disarm and disband. The announcement followed efforts by the Turkish government and Abdullah Öcalan, the jailed PKK leader, to end the four-decade conflict. The commission’s stated aim is to strengthen social integration, consolidate national unity and sisterhood/brotherhood, and advance freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.“Bringing an end to the four-decade Kurdish conflict requires not just ending fighting but concrete steps to change laws that have long been used to bring criminal charges against and incarcerate Kurds and other groups for nonviolent political activity and speech,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The cross-party commission has a unique opportunity to help shape a post-conflict society and should make bold recommendations to repeal abusive laws used to silence and marginalize people.”The briefing, Advancing Human Rights, Justice and Democracy for Kurds and All Other Communities in Türkiye, draws on years of experience by the organizations in litigation, monitoring and documenting human rights violations and attacks against the rule of law and the separation of powers in Türkiye. The groups focused on abusive criminal law provisions which have been applied in discriminatory and politically motivated ways in Türkiye, particularly against Kurds and other perceived dissenting voices. While not exhaustive, the briefing outline four key areas in which structural reforms are urgently needed. The groups urged the commission to recommend achievable changes that can lay the foundation for a more rights-respecting, equitable and democratic post-conflict environment for all individuals and communities in Türkiye.These areas include:Reforming anti-terror legislation by repealing or substantially amending vague and overbroad provisions that have been used in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner to investigate, detain, prosecute and convict a wide range of people who have no material connection to armed groups. Those facing criminal charges have included journalists, lawyers, human rights defenders and other activists, as well as individuals who peacefully express their opinions;Ending the misuse of criminal law against elected officials by stopping the widespread practice of arbitrarily detaining, prosecuting and removing elected opposition politicians, whether members of parliament, mayors, or municipal council members. The officials have been removed solely on the basis of political speech protected under international human rights law, or in response to peaceful activities. In the interests of protecting democratic space and upholding the right to free and fair elections, the commission should make clear that any restrictions on the exercise of an electoral mandate should be exceptional, based on compelling evidence of serious criminal wrongdoing, subject to effective judicial review, and consistent with international human rights law and standards guaranteeing free and fair elections and political participation;Guaranteeing the right to peaceful assembly by ceasing the systemic restriction of public assemblies and demonstrations and the unwarranted and violent police dispersal of those who attempt to exercise their right to peaceful protest. The commission should make clear recommendations to reform the Law on Meetings and Demonstrations and related practice in this area to ensure that the authorities view public demonstrations as a normal part of democratic participation and evidence of an engaged and pluralistic society.Recognizing the “right to hope,” by ensuring that prisoners who are serving “aggravated life” sentences without the prospect of release can be considered for release on the basis of a meaningful, reviewable process. The European Court of Human Rights has found that Türkiye’s current system violates the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment in the European Convention on Human Rights (article 3), and the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers has repeatedly called on Türkiye to reform its law to guarantee all prisoners a real, objective prospect of release. Notably, Devlet Bahçeli, the leader of the Nationalist Action Party in coalition with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party, has publicly referred to the “right to hope” in his parliamentary speeches on ending the conflict with the PKK.“The dialogue process between the parties to the conflict presents a historic opportunity to begin dismantling the entrenched cycle of violence and legal exceptionalism,” said Ayşe Bingöl Demir of the Turkey Human Rights Litigation Support Project (TLSP). “The commission should draw on the available expertise from civil society, lawyers’ groups and academics and take an inclusive and wide-ranging approach to advocating for comprehensive reforms that uphold human rights and the rule of law, and that are necessary to underpin a sustainable peace.”The briefing also highlights two broader cross-cutting concerns that the commission should address. One is judicial independence: concrete steps are needed to ensure that the judiciary is institutionally protected from undue influence and able to uphold the rule of law for all, without interference or discrimination.The other is accountability for grave human rights violations: the commission should address long-standing impunity for serious human rights violations that has marked the conflict. The commission should propose credible avenues for accountability for these violations committed by abusers on all sides of the conflict, and mechanisms for truth-telling and justice as necessary conditions for building a rights-based and democratic future for everyone in Türkiye.“To fulfill its mandate, the commission should go beyond symbolic recommendations by addressing the structural injustices and discriminatory legal frameworks that have sustained decades of conflict, repression and impunity,” said Temur Shakirov, Europe and Central Asia program director of the International Commission of Jurists.

      "summary": "The Second World Summit for Social Development concluded in Doha on Thursday with calls for countries to move swiftly from commitments to implementation, ensuring that the Doha Political Declaration delivers measurable progress on poverty reduction, decent work and social inclusion.",
      "content": "Speaking at the closing press conference, President of the UN General Assembly Annalena Baerbock said the Summit marked a “deliberate shift” from identifying gaps to acting on proven solutions.\n\n“Copenhagen taught us 30 years ago that social development and inclusion are essential for strong societies,” she said. “We promised to leave no one behind. Social development is not a ‘nice to have’ nor an act of charity. It is in the self-interest of every country.”\n\nShe warned that hunger and poverty today are not caused by scarcity, but by conflict, inequality and political failures, stressing: “One of the biggest problems is not money as such. It is rather how it is invested.”\n\nMore than 40 Heads of State and Government, over 230 ministers and senior officials, and nearly 14,000 attendees took part in the Summit.\n\nAlongside the formal plenary and roundtable discussions, more than 250 “solution sessions” were held to exchange practical approaches to expanding social protection, improving access to healthcare and education, and supporting work that provides dignity.\n\n‘People expect results’\n\nDeputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said the outcome reflects the urgency expressed by civil society, trade unions, community leaders, businesses and youth representatives throughout the week.\n\n“The message has been clear: people expect us to deliver answers, not simply declarations,” she said. “The Doha Political Declaration is not a document for the shelves. It is a commitment to place people at the centre of sustainable development.”\n\nShe emphasised that implementation must now focus on accelerating poverty reduction, creating real jobs and ensuring no one is left behind. “We have opened the door in Doha. Now we must walk through it together.”\n\n‘Invest in people’\n\nAmbassador Alya Ahmed Saif Al-Thani of Qatar said hosting the Summit reflects her country’s conviction that equality, dignity and inclusion are essential to peace and prosperity.\n\n“Investing in people is the most sustained investment a nation can make,” she said, noting Qatar’s social spending at home and international development partnerships abroad.\n\nShe stressed that the priority now is to ensure that commitments move off the page and into policy, supported by international cooperation and innovative financing.\n\n“The outcomes of this Summit provide a strong foundation,” she said. “What matters most now is implementation.”\n\nBroadcast of the press conference.\n\nUN regional bodies to support follow-through\n\nRegional economic commissions said they will assist countries in translating commitments into practical measures.\n\nThe Economic Commission for Europe highlighted support for ageing policies, affordable housing, just energy transitions, and better poverty data, helping governments design systems that reach those most at risk.\n\nThe Economic Commission for Africa underscored the continent’s “youth potential,” calling for investments in education, skills, employment opportunities and entrepreneurship, in partnership with the African Union and regional institutions.\n\nUN News has been on the ground in Doha covering the Summit throughout the week.

      "summary": "The UN High Commissioner for Refugees appealed on Thursday for more solutions to address forced displacement in his final address to the General Assembly. ",
      "content": "Filippo Grandi reported that for the first time in nearly a decade, the number of refugees and other people fleeing war, violence and persecution, has decreased – from 123 million at the end of 2024 to about 117 million today.\n\n“This may seem surprising. Because the world has not become safer – on the contrary,” he said, pointing to conflicts in places such as Sudan, Gaza, Ukraine and Myanmar.\n\nVoluntary return crucial\n\nThe “unexpected decrease” has largely been driven by returns to places of origin, mainly Syria and Afghanistan. Most were voluntary, despite continued fragility in these locations.\n\n“The voluntary nature of returns is an important distinction which statistics cannot always capture, as the decrease in the total number of forcibly displaced people also accounts unfortunately for returns that were not voluntary,” said Mr. Grandi.\n\nThe return of displaced Syrians “illustrates very clearly the dynamic of voluntariness,” he told ambassadors.\n\nMore than a million refugees have come back since the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, while some two million people inside Syria have returned to communities of origin.\n\nGreater support for Syria\n\nMr. Grandi stressed the need to support Syria, where teams from his refugee agency, UNHCR, are on the ground providing cash assistance, shelter rehabilitation, documentation and other services to meet immediate needs.\n\n“But much more is needed,” he said. “The international community, and especially donors in the Gulf region and Europe and the international financial institutions, must step up their support in building infrastructure, restoring services, reforming the security sector, restarting the economy.”\n\nForced returns to Afghanistan\n\nThe situation of Afghans, particularly those forced to return from Iran and Pakistan, has been the other driver of lower displacement figures.\n\nThe two countries have hosted Afghan refugees for decades, who received access to services “practically on par with nationals.” Furthermore, generations of these refugees, especially women, were educated in local schools.\n\n“But the recent waves of forced returns to Afghanistan deny many Afghan refugees the protection they need, forcing them back to an environment where human rights violations and discrimination are widespread -– especially against women,” he remarked.\n\nProtection and opportunities\n\nMr. Grandi explained that forced displacement is “a complex phenomenon” as “people may flee a country at the same time as others return to it,” which is the case in both Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nResponse is also “a complex challenge”, however “the solution does not lie in restrictions, barriers and pushbacks”.\n\nHe suggested that “it is more strategic to look at entire displacement routes and identify measures that provide protection and opportunities to people on the move, and their hosts, as early as possible — before people cross several borders.”\n\nFinancial shortfall\n\nMr. Grandi is leaving UNHCR in the coming weeks “after 10 challenging yet fascinating years.”\n\nBefore concluding his remarks, he addressed how the “drastic and sudden reductions in financing” this year have had an impact on the agency and the entire humanitarian sector.\n\nUNHCR faces a $1.3 billion shortfall and expects to receive less than $4 billion this year, out of a budget of $10.6 billion.\n\nHe urged donors to help “bridge the gap” and make early flexible pledges for 2026.",

      "personality_title": "Global refugee numbers drop for first time in years as voluntary returns rise",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – For nearly ten years, the number of people forced to leave their homes because of war, violence, or persecution kept growing, reaching 123 million by the end of 2024. These people are called refugees or forcibly displaced persons.\n\n**What happened** – Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), announced that this number has now dropped to about 117 million. This is the first decrease in almost a decade. The main reason is that more people are voluntarily returning to their home countries, especially Syria and Afghanistan, despite ongoing difficulties there.\n\n**Impact** – This drop is important because it shows that some refugees feel safe enough to go back home, which is not common in such tough situations. For example, over a million Syrians have returned since late 2024 after the fall of the Assad regime. However, there are still challenges, like forced returns to Afghanistan, where many refugees face human rights problems, especially women. The drop in numbers also highlights how complicated displacement is, with people leaving and returning at the same time.\n\n**What's next step** – UNHCR and other groups want more help from countries and donors to support refugees and those returning home. They need money to rebuild homes, provide services, and protect people’s rights. Right now, UNHCR is missing $1.3 billion in funding and is asking for more donations to continue their work in 2026.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – For the first time in years, fewer people are forced to flee their homes, thanks to more voluntary returns, but continued support and funding are crucial to keep helping refugees and rebuild communities.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Depuis près de dix ans, le nombre de personnes contraintes de fuir leur foyer à cause de la guerre, de la violence ou de persécutions ne cessait d’augmenter, atteignant 123 millions fin 2024. Ces personnes sont appelées réfugiés ou déplacés forcés.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Filippo Grandi, Haut-Commissaire des Nations unies pour les réfugiés (HCR), a annoncé que ce nombre est maintenant descendu à environ 117 millions. C’est la première baisse depuis presque dix ans. Cette baisse s’explique surtout par le retour volontaire de nombreuses personnes dans leur pays d’origine, notamment en Syrie et en Afghanistan, malgré les difficultés persistantes.\n\n**Impact** – Cette diminution est importante car elle montre que certains réfugiés se sentent assez en sécurité pour rentrer chez eux, ce qui est rare dans de telles situations difficiles. Par exemple, plus d’un million de Syriens sont revenus depuis la fin 2024 après la chute du régime Assad. Cependant, des défis restent, comme les retours forcés en Afghanistan où beaucoup de réfugiés, surtout des femmes, subissent des violations des droits humains. La baisse illustre aussi la complexité des déplacements, avec des départs et des retours en même temps.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le HCR et d’autres organisations demandent plus d’aide des pays et des donateurs pour soutenir les réfugiés et ceux qui rentrent chez eux. Ils ont besoin d’argent pour reconstruire les maisons, fournir des services et protéger les droits des personnes. Actuellement, le HCR manque 1,3 milliard de dollars de financement et appelle à plus de dons pour continuer leur travail en 2026.\n\n**En une phrase** – Pour la première fois depuis des années, moins de personnes sont contraintes de fuir leur foyer grâce à plus de retours volontaires, mais un soutien continu et des financements restent essentiels pour aider les réfugiés et reconstruire les communautés.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Durante casi diez años, la cantidad de personas obligadas a abandonar sus hogares por guerras, violencia o persecución no dejó de crecer, llegando a 123 millones a finales de 2024. Estas personas se llaman refugiados o desplazados forzosos.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Filippo Grandi, el Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Refugiados (ACNUR), anunció que esa cifra ha bajado a alrededor de 117 millones. Es la primera disminución en casi una década. La razón principal es que más personas están regresando voluntariamente a sus países, especialmente a Siria y Afganistán, a pesar de las dificultades que aún enfrentan.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta caída es importante porque muestra que algunos refugiados se sienten lo suficientemente seguros para volver a casa, algo poco común en estas situaciones difíciles. Por ejemplo, más de un millón de sirios han regresado desde finales de 2024 tras la caída del régimen de Assad. Sin embargo, hay desafíos, como los retornos forzados a Afganistán, donde muchos refugiados enfrentan problemas de derechos humanos, especialmente las mujeres. La cifra también refleja lo complejo que es el desplazamiento, con personas que salen y regresan al mismo tiempo.\n\n**Próximo paso** – ACNUR y otros grupos quieren más ayuda de países y donantes para apoyar a los refugiados y a quienes regresan a sus hogares. Necesitan dinero para reconstruir viviendas, ofrecer servicios y proteger los derechos de las personas. Ahora mismo, ACNUR tiene un déficit de 1.300 millones de dólares y pide más donaciones para continuar su trabajo en 2026.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Por primera vez en años, menos personas se ven obligadas a huir de sus hogares gracias a más retornos voluntarios, pero el apoyo y financiamiento continuo son clave para seguir ayudando a los refugiados y reconstruir comunidades.",
