The image is sharper, deeper, and wider than anything previously released, uncovering both star-forming regions and the remains of ancient stellar explosions. Scientists can now better distinguish where stars are being born versus where they’ve met dramatic ends. The discovery opens powerful new ways to study the life cycle of stars and the shape of our galaxy.",
      "content": "Astronomers at the International Centre of Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) have produced the largest low-frequency radio color image of the Milky Way ever assembled. The new image presents an extraordinary view of our galaxy as seen from the Southern Hemisphere, revealing the Milky Way across a broad range of radio wavelengths, often described as different colors of radio light.\n\nBy capturing the galaxy in this way, the image opens up powerful new opportunities to study how stars are born, how they evolve, and how they ultimately die within the Milky Way.\n\nYears of Computing Power Behind the Image\n\nThe image was created by Silvia Mantovanini, a PhD student at the Curtin University node of ICRAR. She spent 18 months working on the project and used roughly 1M CPU hours on supercomputers at the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre. These systems were needed to process and combine massive amounts of data collected during two major sky surveys.\n\nThe observations were carried out with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescope, located at Inyarrimanha Ilgari Bundara, the CSIRO Murchison Radio-Astronomy Observatory on Wajarri Yamaji Country in Western Australia.\n\nThe data came from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey and its follow-up, GLEAM-X (GLEAM eXtended). GLEAM was observed over 28 nights during 2013 and 2014, while GLEAM-X gathered data across 113 nights from 2018 to 2020.\n\nSharper, Deeper, and Wider Than Before\n\nFocusing specifically on our own galaxy, the new image represents a major leap forward compared with the earlier GLEAM image released in 2019. It delivers twice the resolution, ten times the sensitivity, and covers twice as much of the sky.\n\nThese improvements allow astronomers to examine the Milky Way in far greater detail than before, uncovering features that were previously difficult or impossible to see.\n\n\"This vibrant image delivers an unparalleled perspective of our Galaxy at low radio frequencies,\" Ms. Mantovanini said.\n\n\"It provides valuable insights into the evolution of stars, including their formation in various regions of the Galaxy, how they interact with other celestial objects, and ultimately their demise.\"\n\nTracing Exploded Stars and Stellar Nurseries\n\nMs. Mantovanini's research focuses on supernova remnants, the expanding clouds of gas and energy created when a star explodes at the end of its life. While astronomers have already identified hundreds of these remnants, many researchers believe thousands more remain undiscovered.\n\nThe new image makes it easier to separate the material surrounding newly forming stars from the gas left behind by dead ones, revealing clearer structures throughout the galaxy.\n\n\"You can clearly identify remnants of exploded stars, represented by large red circles. The smaller blue regions indicate stellar nurseries where new stars are actively forming,\" Ms. Mantovanini said.\n\nNew Clues About Pulsars\n\nThe image may also help scientists better understand pulsars, the rapidly spinning remnants of massive stars. By analyzing how bright pulsars appear across different GLEAM-X frequencies, astronomers hope to learn more about how these objects produce radio waves and where they are distributed throughout the Milky Way.\n\nA Milestone in Mapping the Milky Way\n\nAssociate Professor Natasha Hurley-Walker, a member of the same ICRAR team and the principal investigator of the GLEAM-X survey, highlighted the importance of the achievement for studying the structure of our galaxy.\n\n\"This low-frequency image allows us to unveil large astrophysical structures in our Galaxy that are difficult to image at higher frequencies,\"\n\n\"No low-frequency radio image of the entire Southern Galactic Plane has been published before, making this an exciting milestone in astronomy.\"\n\n\"Only the world's largest radio telescope, the SKA Observatory's SKA-Low telescope, set to be completed in the next decade on Wajarri Yamaji Country in Western Australia, will have the capacity to surpass this image in terms of sensitivity and resolution,\" concluded Associate Professor Hurley-Walker.\n\nTens of Thousands of Cosmic Sources Revealed\n\nThe surveys behind the image required hundreds of hours of observations using the MWA radio telescope at Inyarrimanha Ilgari Bundara, the CSIRO Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory. Using this data, ICRAR researchers catalogued around 98,000 radio sources across the portion of the Galactic Plane visible from the southern hemisphere.\n\nThese sources include pulsars, planetary nebulae, compact HII regions -- which are dense, ionized gas clouds in space -- as well as distant galaxies that lie far beyond the Milky Way.",

      "title": "Astronomers found a black hole growing way too fast",
      "summary": "Astronomers have spotted a rare, rule-breaking quasar in the early Universe that appears to be growing its central black hole at an astonishing pace. Observations show the black hole is devouring matter far faster than theory says it should—about 13 times the usual “speed limit”—while simultaneously blasting out bright X-rays and launching a powerful radio jet. This surprising combination wasn’t supposed to happen, according to many models, and suggests scientists may be catching the black hole during a brief, unstable growth spurt.",
      "content": "An international team of astronomers led by researchers from Waseda University and Tohoku University has identified an unusual quasar in the early Universe that contains one of the fastest-growing supermassive black holes known for its size. Data from the Subaru Telescope show a surprising mix of traits. The quasar is pulling in matter at an exceptionally high rate while also emitting intense X-rays and launching a strong radio jet. Many existing theories suggest these features should not appear together, making this object a rare and revealing find. The observations provide fresh insight into how supermassive black holes may have grown so quickly in the Universe's early days.\n\nSupermassive black holes, with masses ranging from millions to billions of times that of the Sun, reside at the centers of most galaxies. They increase in size by drawing in surrounding gas. As this material spirals inward, it forms a rotating accretion disk and can energize a compact region of extremely hot plasma known as a corona (a key source of X-rays). In some cases, the system also produces a narrow jet that shines brightly at radio wavelengths. When black holes are actively feeding and extremely luminous, they are known as quasars. A major unanswered question remains how some of these giants became so massive so early in cosmic history.\n\nPushing Beyond the Black Hole Growth Limit\n\nOne proposed explanation for rapid early growth is super-Eddington accretion. Under standard conditions, radiation released by infalling material pushes outward, limiting how fast a black hole can grow. This theoretical cap is known as the Eddington limit. Certain extreme environments, however, may allow black holes to exceed this limit for short periods, leading to very rapid increases in mass.\n\nTo investigate whether this kind of growth occurred in the early Universe, the researchers used the Subaru Telescope's near-infrared spectrograph (MOIRCS). By tracking the motion of gas near the quasar and analyzing the Mg II (2800 Å) emission line, they estimated the black hole's mass. The results point to a supermassive black hole that existed about 12 billion years ago and is accreting matter at roughly 13 times the Eddington limit, based on X-ray measurements.\n\nA Quasar That Defies Expectations\n\nWhat sets this object apart is how it behaves across different wavelengths of light. Many theoretical models predict that during super-Eddington growth, changes in the inner structure of the accretion flow should weaken X-ray emission and suppress jet activity. Instead, this quasar remains bright in X-rays and strongly radio-loud at the same time. The findings suggest the black hole is growing at an extreme pace while still maintaining an active corona and a powerful jet. This unusual combination points to physical processes that current models do not yet fully explain.\n\nThe team suggests the quasar may be observed during a short transitional period, possibly following a sudden influx of gas. In this scenario, a rapid increase in available material drives the black hole into a super-Eddington state. For a limited time, both the X-ray-emitting corona and the radio jet remain highly energized before the system gradually settles into a more typical mode of growth.\n\nIf this interpretation is correct, the object offers a rare chance to study black hole growth as it changes over time in the early Universe, an important step toward explaining how supermassive black holes formed so rapidly.\n\nImplications for Galaxy Evolution\n\nThe strong radio signal indicates that the jet carries enough energy to affect its surroundings. Such jets can heat or disrupt gas within the host galaxy, potentially influencing star formation and shaping how galaxies and their central black holes evolve together. The relationship between super-Eddington growth and jet-driven feedback is still not well understood, and this quasar provides a valuable reference point for testing new ideas.\n\nLead author Sakiko Obuchi (Waseda University) says:\n\n\"This discovery may bring us closer to understanding how supermassive black holes formed so quickly in the early Universe. We want to investigate what powers the unusually strong X-ray and radio emissions, and whether similar objects have been hiding in survey data.\"\n\nThe findings were published as Obuchi et al. \"Discovery of an X-ray Luminous Radio-Loud Quasar at z = 3.4: A Possible Transitional Super-Eddington Phase\" in the Astrophysical Journal on January 21, 2026.\n\nThe research was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Grant Nos. 25K01043, 23K13154, 22H00157), the JST FOREST Program (JPMJFR2466), and a research grant from the Inamori Foundation.\n\nThe Subaru Telescope is a large optical-infrared observatory operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, with support from the MEXT Project to Promote Large Scientific Frontiers. The team acknowledges and respects the cultural, historical, and natural significance of Maunakea in Hawai`i, from where these observations were made.",

      "summary": "A distant Sun-like star suddenly went dark for months, stunning astronomers who quickly realized something massive was passing in front of it. Observations revealed a gigantic disk of gas and dust filled with vaporized metals, swirling around an unseen companion object. For the first time, scientists directly measured the motion of these metallic winds inside such a disk. The findings suggest that even ancient star systems can still experience catastrophic planetary smashups.",
      "content": "Astronomers have identified powerful winds of vaporized metals inside a vast cloud that blocked the light of a distant star for almost nine months. The finding was made using the Gemini South telescope in Chile, one half of the International Gemini Observatory, which is partly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and operated by NSF NOIRLab. The observation offers a rare look at energetic and chaotic activity that can continue shaping planetary systems long after they form.\n\nIn September 2024, a star located about 3000 light-years from Earth abruptly dimmed to just one-fortieth of its normal brightness. That dramatic drop persisted until May 2025. The star, known as J0705+0612, closely resembles our Sun, which made the event especially striking to astronomers.\n\n\"Stars like the Sun don't just stop shining for no reason,\" says Nadia Zakamska, a professor of astrophysics at Johns Hopkins University. \"So dramatic dimming events like this are very rare.\"\n\nMonths of Observations Capture a Rare Event\n\nRealizing that this unusual dimming could reveal something important, Zakamska and her colleagues began an extended observing campaign. They used the Gemini South telescope on Cerro Pachón in Chile, along with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope and the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes. Their results are described in a paper published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\nBy combining new observations with archival data on J0705+0612,[1] the researchers concluded that the star was briefly hidden behind an enormous, slowly drifting cloud of gas and dust. The team estimates that the cloud sits about two billion kilometers (1.2 billion miles) from the star and spans roughly 200 million kilometers (120 million miles) across.\n\nA Massive Companion Holds the Cloud Together\n\nThe data suggest that the cloud is not free-floating. Instead, it appears to be gravitationally bound to a second object that orbits the star far from its center. Although the exact nature of this companion remains uncertain, it must be massive enough to keep the cloud intact.\n\nObservations indicate that the object has at least several times the mass of Jupiter, and possibly much more. It could be a giant planet, a brown dwarf, or an extremely low-mass star.\n\nIf the object turns out to be a star, the cloud would be considered a circumsecondary disk, meaning a debris disk orbiting the smaller member of a two-star system. If it is a planet, the structure would be classified as a circumplanetary disk. In either scenario, seeing a star temporarily blocked by a disk surrounding a secondary object is extremely uncommon, with only a few known cases.\n\nProbing the Cloud With a Powerful New Instrument\n\nTo learn what the cloud is made of, the team turned to Gemini South's newest instrument, the Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST). In March 2025, GHOST observed the dimming event for just over two hours, splitting the starlight into a detailed spectrum that reveals the elements within the cloud.\n\n\"When I started observing the occultation with spectroscopy, I was hoping to unveil something about the chemical composition of the cloud, as no such measurements had been done before. But the result exceeded all my expectations,\" says Zakamska.\n\nThe spectra revealed multiple metals -- elements heavier than helium -- mixed into the gas. Even more striking, the precision of the data allowed the team to track how the gas was moving in three dimensions. This marked the first time scientists have directly measured internal gas motions within a disk orbiting a secondary object such as a planet or a low-mass star.\n\nThe measurements show an active and turbulent environment, with winds of gaseous metals including iron and calcium flowing through the cloud.\n\n\"The sensitivity of GHOST allowed us to not only detect the gas in this cloud, but to actually measure how it is moving,\" Zakamska says. \"That's something we've never been able to do before in a system like this.\"\n\n\"This study illustrates the considerable power of Gemini's newest facility instrument, GHOST,\" notes Chris Davis, NSF Program Director for NOIRLab, \"and further highlights one of Gemini's great strengths -- rapidly responding to transient events like this occultation.\"\n\nEvidence Points to a Disk in the Outer System\n\nThe detailed wind measurements show that the cloud is moving independently of the star itself. Combined with the long duration of the dimming, this confirms that the object blocking the star is a disk surrounding a secondary companion, orbiting in the outer regions of the system.\n\nThe star also shows an excess of infrared radiation, which is often linked to disks of material around young stars. However, J0705+0612 is more than two billion years old, making it unlikely that the disk is leftover material from the system's original formation.\n\nA Possible Planetary Collision\n\nSo where did the disk come from? Zakamska suggests that it may have formed after a major collision between two planets in the outer part of the system. Such an impact could have blasted out enormous amounts of dust, rock, and gas, creating the massive cloud now seen drifting in front of the star.\n\nWhy This Discovery Matters\n\nThe findings demonstrate how new instruments are opening fresh ways to study hidden and short-lived phenomena in distant planetary systems. GHOST, in particular, is allowing astronomers to examine structures that were previously impossible to probe in detail.\n\n\"This event shows us that even in mature planetary systems, dramatic, large-scale collisions can still occur,\" says Zakamska. \"It's a vivid reminder that the Universe is far from static -- it's an ongoing story of creation, destruction, and transformation.\"\n\nNotes\n\nA study using archival data from Harvard found that J0705+0612 underwent two other similar dimming events in 1937 and 1981, establishing a 44-year period.\n\nThe team is composed of Nadia L.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – A star similar to our Sun, named J0705+0612, about 3,000 light-years away, suddenly became much dimmer for almost nine months starting in September 2024. Such a long and deep dimming is very rare for stars like our Sun.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists used several telescopes, including the Gemini South telescope in Chile, to watch the star closely. They discovered that the star was hidden behind a huge cloud of gas and dust about two billion kilometers away from it. This cloud is held together by a massive unseen companion, which could be a giant planet, a brown dwarf, or a very small star. Using a special instrument called GHOST, astronomers measured the metals like iron and calcium in the cloud and tracked how these gases moved inside it for the first time.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first direct observation of metallic winds moving inside a disk around a secondary object orbiting a star. It shows that even old star systems, more than two billion years old, can still have violent events like planetary collisions that create huge clouds of gas and dust. This discovery gives scientists a new way to study how planetary systems change over time.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will continue to study this star and others to learn more about these rare dimming events and the nature of the companion object. They will also use instruments like GHOST to explore similar disks, helping to understand how common such collisions and gas clouds are in space.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – For the first time, astronomers have tracked metal-rich winds in a vast gas cloud blocking a distant star, revealing ongoing dramatic changes in mature planetary systems.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Une étoile similaire à notre Soleil, nommée J0705+0612, située à environ 3 000 années-lumière, est soudainement devenue beaucoup plus faible pendant près de neuf mois à partir de septembre 2024. Un tel affaiblissement long et profond est très rare pour des étoiles comme la nôtre.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des scientifiques ont utilisé plusieurs télescopes, dont le télescope Gemini Sud au Chili, pour observer attentivement l’étoile. Ils ont découvert que l’étoile était cachée derrière un énorme nuage de gaz et de poussière situé à environ deux milliards de kilomètres. Ce nuage est maintenu par un compagnon massif invisible, qui pourrait être une planète géante, une naine brune ou une très petite étoile. Grâce à un instrument spécial appelé GHOST, les astronomes ont mesuré les métaux comme le fer et le calcium dans le nuage et ont suivi pour la première fois leurs mouvements.\n\n**Impact** – C’est la première observation directe de vents métalliques se déplaçant à l’intérieur d’un disque autour d’un objet secondaire en orbite autour d’une étoile. Cela montre que même les systèmes stellaires anciens, âgés de plus de deux milliards d’années, peuvent encore connaître des événements violents comme des collisions planétaires qui créent d’énormes nuages de gaz et de poussière. Cette découverte offre une nouvelle façon d’étudier l’évolution des systèmes planétaires.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs continueront d’étudier cette étoile et d’autres pour mieux comprendre ces événements rares d’affaiblissement et la nature de l’objet compagnon. Ils utiliseront aussi des instruments comme GHOST pour explorer des disques similaires, afin de savoir à quel point ces collisions et nuages de gaz sont fréquents dans l’espace.\n\n**Message clé en une phrase** – Pour la première fois, des astronomes ont suivi des vents riches en métaux dans un vaste nuage de gaz bloquant une étoile lointaine, révélant des changements dramatiques dans des systèmes planétaires matures.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Una estrella parecida al Sol, llamada J0705+0612, ubicada a unos 3.000 años luz, se volvió mucho más tenue durante casi nueve meses a partir de septiembre de 2024. Esta caída prolongada y profunda en su brillo es muy rara en estrellas como la nuestra.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Los científicos usaron varios telescopios, incluyendo el Gemini South en Chile, para observar la estrella de cerca. Descubrieron que la estrella estaba cubierta por una enorme nube de gas y polvo a unos dos mil millones de kilómetros de distancia. Esta nube está sostenida por un compañero masivo invisible, que podría ser un planeta gigante, una enana marrón o una estrella muy pequeña. Con un instrumento especial llamado GHOST, los astrónomos midieron los metales como hierro y calcio en la nube y siguieron por primera vez cómo se movían estos gases.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta es la primera vez que se observa directamente vientos metálicos dentro de un disco alrededor de un objeto secundario que orbita una estrella. Esto muestra que incluso sistemas estelares antiguos, con más de dos mil millones de años, pueden tener eventos violentos como colisiones planetarias que crean grandes nubes de gas y polvo. Este descubrimiento ofrece una nueva forma de estudiar cómo cambian los sistemas planetarios con el tiempo.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores seguirán estudiando esta estrella y otras para entender mejor estos raros eventos de oscurecimiento y la naturaleza del objeto compañero. También usarán instrumentos como GHOST para explorar discos similares y conocer qué tan comunes son estas colisiones y nubes de gas en el espacio.\n\n**Mensaje clave en una frase** – Por primera vez, los astrónomos han rastreado vientos ricos en metales en una gran nube de gas que bloquea una estrella lejana, revelando cambios dramáticos en sistemas planetarios maduros.",
