      "summary": "NASA astronaut Suni Williams has retired after 27 years of service and a career defined by endurance, leadership, and firsts in space. She spent 608 days in orbit, completed nine spacewalks, and twice commanded the International Space Station. Williams flew on everything from the space shuttle to Boeing’s Starliner, playing a key role in shaping modern human spaceflight. Her legacy will influence future missions to the Moon and beyond.",
      "content": "NASA astronaut Suni Williams has retired after a 27-year career with the agency, with her retirement taking effect on Dec. 27, 2025. Over that time, Williams flew three missions to the International Space Station and built one of the most accomplished records in human spaceflight.\n\n\"Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,\" said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. \"Her work advancing science and technology has laid the foundation for Artemis missions to the Moon and advancing toward Mars, and her extraordinary achievements will continue to inspire generations to dream big and push the boundaries of what's possible. Congratulations on your well-deserved retirement, and thank you for your service to NASA and our nation.\"\n\nRecord-Setting Time in Orbit and Spacewalk Milestones\n\nAcross her missions, Williams spent a total of 608 days in space, placing her second among NASA astronauts for cumulative time off Earth. She also ranks sixth for the longest single spaceflight by an American astronaut, tied with NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore. Each spent 286 days in orbit during NASA's Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew-9 missions.\n\nWilliams completed nine spacewalks, adding up to 62 hours and 6 minutes outside the space station. That total stands as the highest amount of spacewalk time achieved by a woman and the fourth-highest cumulative total of all time. She also made history by becoming the first person to run a marathon while in space.\n\n\"Over the course of Suni's impressive career trajectory, she has been a pioneering leader,\" said Vanessa Wyche, director of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"From her indelible contributions and achievements to the space station, to her groundbreaking test flight role during the Boeing Starliner mission, her exceptional dedication to the mission will inspire the future generations of explorers.\"\n\nEarly Space Shuttle Missions\n\nWilliams made her first trip to space in December 2006, launching aboard space shuttle Discovery on mission STS-116. She returned to Earth with the STS-117 crew aboard space shuttle Atlantis. During this mission, she served as a flight engineer for Expeditions 14/15 and carried out four spacewalks, which set a record at the time.\n\nIn 2012, Williams launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for a 127-day mission as part of Expedition 32/33. During Expedition 33, she served as commander of the space station. While in orbit, she performed three spacewalks to repair a leak in a station radiator and replace a component that transfers power from the station's solar arrays to its systems.\n\nStarliner Test Flight and Final Mission\n\nWilliams' most recent mission began in June 2024, when she and Wilmore launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft for NASA's Crew Flight Test mission. The two later joined Expeditions 71/72, and Williams once again took command of the space station during Expedition 72. She completed two additional spacewalks and returned to Earth in March 2025 as part of NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 mission.\n\n\"Suni is incredibly sharp, and an all-around great friend and colleague,\" said Scott Tingle, chief of the Astronaut Office at NASA Johnson. \"She's inspired so many people, including myself and other astronauts in the corps. We're all going to miss her greatly and wish her nothing but the best.\"\n\nWilliams also held several important leadership and training roles throughout her NASA career. In 2002, she took part in NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environments Mission Operations), spending nine days living and working in an underwater habitat. After her first spaceflight, she served as deputy chief of NASA's Astronaut Office. Following her second mission, she became director of Operations in Star City, Russia. More recently, she helped establish a helicopter training platform to prepare astronauts for future Moon landings.\n\nOriginally from Needham, Massachusetts, Williams earned a bachelor's degree in physical science from the United States Naval Academy and a master's degree in engineering management from Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida. She retired from the U.S. Navy as a captain and is an experienced helicopter and fixed-wing pilot, with more than 4,000 flight hours across 40 different aircraft.\n\nLooking Ahead to NASA's Next Chapter\n\n\"Anyone who knows me knows that space is my absolute favorite place to be,\" said Williams. \"It's been an incredible honor to have served in the Astronaut Office and have had the opportunity to fly in space three times. I had an amazing 27-year career at NASA, and that is mainly because of all the wonderful love and support I've received from my colleagues. The International Space Station, the people, the engineering, and the science are truly awe-inspiring and have made the next steps of exploration to the Moon and Mars possible. I hope the foundation we set has made these bold steps a little easier. I am super excited for NASA and its partner agencies as we take these next steps, and I can't wait to watch the agency make history.\"\n\nAfter 27 years of service, NASA astronaut Suni Williams retired from the agency, effective Dec. 27, 2025. Williams completed three missions aboard the International Space Station, setting numerous human spaceflight records throughout her career.\n\n\"Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,\" said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. \"Her work advancing science and technology has laid the foundation for Artemis missions to the Moon and advancing toward Mars, and her extraordinary achievements will continue to inspire generations to dream big and push the boundaries of what's possible.

      "summary": "Trained on data from NASA’s exoplanet-hunting missions, the open-source ExoMiner++ deep learning model uses an advanced algorithm to validate new planets.",
      "content": "This artist's impression shows the star TRAPPIST-1 with two planets transiting across it. ExoMiner++, a recently updated open-source software package developed by NASA, uses artificial intelligence to help find new transiting exoplanets in data collected by NASA’s missions. NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI)\n\nScientists have discovered over 6,000 planets that orbit stars other than our Sun, known as exoplanets. More than half of these planets were discovered thanks to data from NASA’s retired Kepler mission and NASA’s current TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission. However, the enormous treasure trove of data from these missions still contains many yet-to-be-discovered planets. All of the data from both missions is publicly available in NASA archives, and many teams around the world have used that data to find new planets using a number of techniques.\n\nIn 2021, a team from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley created ExoMiner, a piece of open-source software that used artificial intelligence (AI) to validate 370 new exoplanets from Kepler data. Now, the team has created a new version of the model trained on both Kepler and TESS data, called ExoMiner++.\n\nArtist's impression of NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which launched in 2018 and has discovered nearly 700 exoplanets so far. NASA’s ExoMiner++ software is working toward identifying more planets in TESS data using artificial intelligence. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThe new algorithm, which is discussed in a recent paper published in the Astronomical Journal, identified 7,000 targets as exoplanet candidates from TESS on an initial run. An exoplanet candidate is a signal that is likely to be a planet but requires follow-up observations from additional telescopes to confirm.\n\nExoMiner++ can be freely downloaded from GitHub, allowing any researcher to use the tool to hunt for planets in TESS’s growing public data archive.\n\n“Open-source software like ExoMiner accelerates scientific discovery,” said Kevin Murphy, NASA’s chief science data officer at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “When researchers freely share the tools they've developed, it lets others replicate the results and dig deeper into the data, which is why open data and code are important pillars of gold-standard science.”\n\nExoMiner++ sifts through observations of possible transits to predict which ones are caused by exoplanets and which ones are caused by other astronomical events, such as eclipsing binary stars. “When you have hundreds of thousands of signals, like in this case, it’s the ideal place to deploy these deep learning technologies,” said Miguel Martinho, a KBR employee at NASA Ames who serves as the co-investigator for ExoMiner++.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video This animation shows a graph of the tiny amount of dimming that takes place when a planet passes in front of its host star. NASA’s Kepler and TESS missions spot exoplanets by looking for these transits. ExoMiner++ uses artificial intelligence to help separate real planet transits from other, similar-looking astronomical phenomena. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nKepler and TESS operate differently — TESS is surveying nearly the whole sky, mainly looking for planets transiting nearby stars, while Kepler looked at a small patch of sky more deeply than TESS. Despite these different observing strategies, the two missions produce compatible datasets, allowing ExoMiner++ to train on data from both telescopes and deliver strong results. “With not many resources, we can make a lot of returns,” said Hamed Valizadegan, the project lead for ExoMiner and a KBR employee at NASA Ames.\n\nThe next version of ExoMiner++ will improve the usefulness of the model and inform future exoplanet detection efforts. While ExoMiner++ can currently flag planet candidates when given a list of possible transit signals, the team is also working on giving the model the ability to identify the signals themselves from the raw data.\n\nOpen-source science and open-source software are why the exoplanet field is advancing as quickly as it is. Jon Jenkins Exoplanet Scientist, NASA Ames Research Center\n\nIn addition to the ongoing stream of data from TESS, future exoplanet-hunting missions will give ExoMiner users plenty more data to work with. NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will capture tens of thousands of exoplanet transits — and, like TESS data, Roman data will be freely available in line with NASA’s commitment to Gold Standard Science and sharing data with the public. The advances made with the ExoMiner models could help hunt for exoplanets in Roman data, too.\n\n“The open science initiative out of NASA is going to lead to not just better science, but also better software,” said Jon Jenkins, an exoplanet scientist at NASA Ames. “Open-source science and open-source software are why the exoplanet field is advancing as quickly as it is.”\n\nNASA's Office of the Chief Science Data Officer leads the open science efforts for the agency. Public sharing of scientific data, tools, research, and software maximizes the impact of NASA’s science missions.
