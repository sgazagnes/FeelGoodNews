That proposal urges lawmakers to adopt a rights-based framework grounded in autonomy, participation, and independent living for care and support legislation.The Coalition, Cuidados Sí; Apoyos También (Care Yes; Supports Too), is made up largely of people with disabilities. It includes organizations such as Mexicanas con Discapacidad, Women Enabled International, Movimiento de Personas con Discapacidad as well as human rights organizations including Yo También, Human Rights Watch, and Documenta. The coalition has submitted a proposal calling on legislators to include a dedicated chapter on support for independent living in the care and support bills currently under review by the Congress of Mexico City.“Care and support policies developed without the meaningful participation of the people who will rely on them risk reinforcing the very dependence and exclusion they are meant to address,” said Carlos Ríos Espinosa, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “People with disabilities are not passive recipients of care and support. They are rights holders, with expertise grounded in lived experience, and their proposals deserve serious consideration.”The coalition submitted its proposal as the Mexico City Congress moves from pre-consultations toward drafting formal care and support legislation. Members urged lawmakers to seize the opportunity to build a care and support system that expands choice, autonomy, and inclusion, in line with Advisory Opinion 31/2025 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Tlatelolco Commitment, a regional agreement.The proposal seeks to shift the focus of Mexico City’s care and support system away from narrow, charity-based approaches and toward a comprehensive, rights-based framework aligned with international human rights law, Human Rights Watch said. It outlines a broad range of support that people with disabilities may require to exercise their rights on an equal basis with others. These include support to access information, exercise legal capacity, prevent and report violence, ensure personal mobility, participate in education and employment, and engage fully in community and public life.The proposal also emphasizes the central role of personal assistance and community-based services, such as centers for independent living, to prevent institutionalization and forced dependence on families.Diana Velarde, executive director of Mexicanas con Discapacidad and a member of the coalition, said the proposal reflects what people with disabilities have long demanded in their daily lives. “For many of us, support is not an abstract legal concept—it is what makes it possible to leave our homes, participate in our communities, and live with dignity,” Velarde said. “This proposal puts into law what international standards already recognize: that care and support are rights, and that states have an obligation to ensure they are available, accessible, and centered on people’s autonomy.”Coalition members also emphasized the often invisible costs of relying on unpaid family care and support. Sara Villanueva, a member of the coalition who requires intensive support, said the absence of adequate public systems places an unsustainable responsibility on families, particularly as the parents of people with disabilities grow older.“In many cases, the support that allows us to live day to day is provided by our families, without pay, without rest, and without alternatives,” Villanueva said. “My parents—both in their 80s—continue to provide essential support so that I can live my life. This is not a solution that can last forever.”Villanueva emphasized that the proposal is especially significant because it reflects the realities of people with disabilities themselves. “This coalition is made up almost entirely of people with disabilities, most of us women,” she said. “Our proposal responds to real needs and real barriers, not assumptions about our lives.”“Aligning care and support policies with international human rights standards is both possible and effective to ensure rights for care and support providers and people with disabilities,” Ríos Espinosa said. “Mexico City has an opportunity to ensure that its legislative proposals on care and support are consistent with these standards and recognize supports for independent living as a core component of equality and dignity for people with disabilities.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Mexico City is working on new laws about care and support for people who need help in daily life. Right now, these laws often focus on charity, which can make people feel dependent instead of independent.\n\n**What happened** – A group called Cuidados Sí; Apoyos También (Care Yes; Supports Too), mostly made up of people with disabilities and human rights groups, sent a proposal to Mexico City's Congress. They want the new care law to focus on rights like independence, choice, and community participation. The proposal asks lawmakers to include a special chapter about helping people live independently.\n\n**Impact** – This proposal is important because it comes directly from people with disabilities who know what support they really need. It moves away from old ideas that treat care as a favor and instead treats it as a right. It also points out problems with relying only on family members for support, which can be very hard on families, especially as they get older.\n\n**What's next step** – Mexico City Congress will review this proposal as they write the new care and support law. If they accept it, the city could create a law that helps people with disabilities live more independently and with dignity, following international human rights standards.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – People with disabilities in Mexico City are leading a new proposal to make care and support laws that respect their independence and rights.\n",

Actuellement, ces lois sont souvent basées sur la charité, ce qui peut rendre les personnes dépendantes au lieu d’indépendantes.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Un groupe nommé Cuidados Sí; Apoyos También (Soins Oui; Soutiens Aussi), composé principalement de personnes handicapées et d’organisations de défense des droits humains, a soumis une proposition au Congrès de Mexico. Ils souhaitent que la nouvelle loi sur les soins mette l’accent sur les droits comme l’indépendance, le choix et la participation dans la communauté. La proposition demande une partie spéciale sur le soutien à la vie indépendante.\n\n**Impact** – Cette proposition est importante car elle vient directement des personnes handicapées qui savent quel soutien elles ont vraiment besoin. Elle s’éloigne des anciennes idées qui considèrent les soins comme une faveur et les traite comme un droit. Elle souligne aussi les difficultés liées au fait de compter uniquement sur la famille pour le soutien, ce qui peut être très lourd, surtout avec l’âge.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le Congrès de Mexico va examiner cette proposition en rédigeant la nouvelle loi sur les soins et le soutien. S’ils l’acceptent, la ville pourrait créer une loi qui aide les personnes handicapées à vivre plus indépendamment et dignement, en suivant les normes internationales des droits humains.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – Les personnes handicapées de Mexico dirigent une nouvelle proposition pour que les lois sur les soins respectent leur indépendance et leurs droits.\n",

      "content": "On Wednesday Parliament adopted a package of proposals aimed at supporting Ukraine with a €90 billion EU loan for 2026 and 2027. The so-called Ukraine support loan will help meet Ukraine’s urgent financing needs amid Russia’s ongoing war of aggression entering its fifth year.\n\nOf the loan, €30 billion will be made available for macro-financial assistance or budget support, delivered through the EU’s Ukraine Facility. €60 billion will be allocated to strengthen Ukraine’s defence capabilities and support the procurement of military equipment, ensuring timely access to critical defence products from - in principle - Ukrainian, EU, and European Economic Area (EEA)/European Free Trade Association (EFTA) defence industries. If certain defence material is not immediately available from these countries for urgent delivery to Ukraine, a set of targeted derogations will apply to sourcing them from other countries.\n\nFinancial assistance will be provided in line with Ukraine’s financing needs, as set out in a financing strategy prepared by Ukraine and assessed by the Commission. The strategy will require approval by the Council.\n\nAll funding will be subject to strict conditions, including Ukraine’s continued commitment to democratic governance, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights, including the rights of minorities. This includes ongoing efforts to combat corruption and strengthen democratic institutions.\n\nThe support loan will be financed through common EU borrowing from capital markets and guaranteed by the “headroom” of the EU long-term budget, and debt-servicing costs will be covered by the EU’s annual budgets. The Commission has estimated the debt service costs at around €1 billion for 2027 and around €3 billion per year from 2028. Ukraine will be liable for the repayment of the principal of the loan once it receives war reparations from Russia.\n\nThe legislative acts needed to complete this support package were adopted under the Parliament’s urgent procedure to ensure the provision of rapid aid to Ukraine. The proposal on the Ukraine support loan was approved with 458 votes to 140 and 44 abstentions, the proposal to amend the Ukraine Facility received 473 votes to 140, and 32 abstentions, while the proposal to amend the 2021-2027 EU long-term budget (MFF) secured 490 votes to 130 and 32 abstentions.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Council also needs to formally adopt the package in order for the Commission to be able to disburse the first payment early in the second quarter of 2026.\n\nBackground\n\nThe EU support loan was agreed at the European Council in Brussels on 18 December 2025, and presented by the European Commission on 14 January 2026. The €90 billion is intended to cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s estimated financial needs for the period concerned. As Czechia, Hungary and Slovakia have opted out from backing the loan, the agreement was taken under the enhanced cooperation procedure, a mechanism that allows willing EU member states to collaborate in specific areas absent unanimity.",

The decision was adopted in plenary by 593 votes in favour, 55 against and 9 abstentions.\n\nIn February 2025, Audi halted production of its Q8 e-tron model in Brussels and shuttered the plant after over 75 years activity, triggering layoffs not only at Audi itself but also among several of its suppliers. The EGF support is expected to benefit 2,580 former Audi employees and 834 workers from supplier firms. EU-funded measures will include career guidance, job-search assistance, training in new skills, and support for workers wishing to set up their own businesses.\n\nMEPs expressed regret over Audi’s decision to cease its activities in Belgium despite remaining profitable, noting that production will be relocated to China and Mexico. They also voiced concern that challenging production conditions - including insufficient access to and deployment of affordable clean energy sources - contributed to Audi’s decision to relocate.\n\nThe total cost of the support package is estimated at €8.8 million. The EU will finance 85% of the amount (€7.5 million), while the remaining 15% (€1.3 million) will be covered by the Belgian regional public employment services.\n\nBackground\n\nUnder the EGF Regulation 2021-2027, the fund supports displaced workers and self-employed people who have lost their jobs due to unexpected major restructuring events. Member states can apply for EU funding when at least 200 workers are made redundant within a defined reference period. If the application meets the EGF criteria, the Commission proposes mobilising funds, which must be approved by the European Parliament and the Council. According to the Commission, the EGF has helped more than 181,000 people in 20 member states, supporting 186 cases with €727 million disbursed.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Audi closed its Brussels factory in February 2025 after more than 75 years of operation. This closure led to thousands of workers losing their jobs, including those employed by Audi and its suppliers.\n\n**What happened** – On Wednesday, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted to release €7.5 million from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). This money will help 3,414 workers affected by the factory shutdown.

The EU will cover 85% of the total €8.8 million cost, with Belgium’s regional public employment services paying the rest.\n\n**Impact** – This funding is important because it offers real support to workers facing sudden unemployment due to big changes in industry. It helps them find new jobs or create their own companies, reducing the hardship caused by the factory closure. The case also highlights challenges like limited access to affordable clean energy, which influenced Audi’s decision to move production abroad.\n\n**What's next step** – The support programs will now begin to help the former Audi workers and those from supplier companies. This will include training sessions and business support activities. The EU’s continued approval of such funds shows ongoing attention to workers affected by major economic changes.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU is providing €7.5 million to support over 3,400 workers in Belgium after Audi’s factory closure, offering training and job help to ease their transition.\n",
