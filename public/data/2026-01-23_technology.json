      "summary": "Scientists are learning how to temporarily reshape materials by nudging their internal quantum rhythms instead of blasting them with extreme lasers. By harnessing excitons, short-lived energy pairs that naturally form inside semiconductors, researchers can alter how electrons behave using far less energy than before. This approach achieves powerful quantum effects without damaging the material, overcoming a major barrier that has limited progress for years.",
      "content": "What if simply shining light on a material could give it entirely new abilities?\n\nThat idea may sound like fantasy, but it sits at the heart of an emerging area of physics known as Floquet engineering. Researchers in this field study how repeating influences, such as carefully tuned light, can temporarily reshape the way electrons behave inside a material. When this happens, a familiar substance like a semiconductor can briefly take on unusual properties, including behaviors normally associated with superconductors.\n\nAlthough the basic theory behind Floquet physics dates back to a 2009 proposal by Oka and Aoki, experimental proof has been difficult. Only a small number of experiments over the past decade have successfully demonstrated clear Floquet effects. One major limitation has been the need for extremely intense light. These high energy levels come close to destroying the material while still producing only modest changes.\n\nExcitons Offer a More Efficient Alternative\n\nResearchers have now identified a promising new way to achieve Floquet effects without relying on such extreme light conditions. A global team led by the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and Stanford University has shown that excitons can drive these effects far more efficiently than light alone. Their findings were published in Nature Physics.\n\n\"Excitons couple much stronger to the material than photons due to the strong Coulomb interaction, particularly in 2D materials,\" says Professor Keshav Dani from the Femtosecond Spectroscopy Unit at OIST, \"and they can thus achieve strong Floquet effects while avoiding the challenges posed by light. With this, we have a new potential pathway to the exotic future quantum devices and materials that Floquet engineering promises.\"\n\nThis approach points to a new route for controlling quantum materials while reducing the risk of damage.\n\nHow Floquet Engineering Changes Quantum Materials\n\nFloquet engineering has long been seen as a possible way to create custom quantum materials from ordinary semiconductors. The idea is based on a familiar physical principle. When a system experiences a repeating influence, its response can become more complex than the repetition itself. A simple example is a playground swing, where timed pushes cause the swing to rise higher even though the motion remains rhythmic.\n\nIn quantum materials, electrons already experience a repeating structure because atoms are arranged in an orderly crystal lattice. This spatial repetition restricts electrons to specific energy levels, known as bands. When light with a fixed frequency interacts with the crystal, it introduces a second repeating influence that unfolds over time. As photons interact rhythmically with electrons, the allowed energy bands shift.\n\nBy carefully adjusting the light's frequency and intensity, electrons can temporarily occupy new hybrid energy bands. These changes affect how electrons move and interact, which alters the material's overall properties. When the light is turned off, the material returns to its original state. During the interaction, however, researchers can effectively dress materials with new quantum behaviors.\n\nWhy Light-Based Approaches Fall Short\n\n\"Until now, Floquet engineering has been synonymous with light drives,\" says Xing Zhu, PhD student at OIST. \"But while these systems have been instrumental to proving the existence of Floquet effects, light couple weakly to matter, meaning that very high frequencies, often at the femtosecond scale, are required to achieve hybridization. Such high energy levels tend to vaporize the material, and the effects are very short-lived. By contrast, excitonic Floquet engineering require much lower intensities.\"\n\nThis challenge has slowed progress toward practical applications.\n\nWhat Excitons Are and Why They Matter\n\nExcitons form inside semiconductors when electrons absorb energy and jump from their resting state in the valence band to a higher energy state in the conduction band. This process leaves behind a positively charged hole. The electron and hole remain linked as a short-lived quasiparticle until the electron falls back and emits light.\n\nBecause excitons originate from the material's own electrons, they interact much more strongly with the surrounding structure than external light does. They also carry oscillating energy from their initial excitation, which influences nearby electrons at adjustable frequencies.\n\n\"Excitons carry self-oscillating energy, imparted by the initial excitation, which impacts the surrounding electrons in the material at tunable frequencies. Because the excitons are created from the electrons of the material itself, they couple much more strongly with the material than light. And crucially, it takes significantly less light to create a population of excitons dense enough to serve as an effective periodic drive for hybridization - which is what we have now observed,\" explains co-author Professor Gianluca Stefanucci of the University of Rome Tor Vergata.\n\nCapturing the Effect With Advanced Spectroscopy\n\nThis advance builds on years of exciton research at OIST and the development of a powerful TR-ARPES (time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy) system.\n\nTo separate the effects of light from those of excitons, the team studied an atomically thin semiconductor. They first applied a strong optical (i.e. light) drive to directly observe changes in the electronic band structure, confirming the expected Floquet behavior. Then they reduced the light intensity by more than an order of magnitude and measured the electronic response 200 femtoseconds later. This timing allowed them to isolate the excitonic contribution.\n\n\"The experiments spoke for themselves,\" says Dr. Vivek Pareek, OIST graduate who is now a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at the California Institute of Technology. \"It took us tens of hours of data acquisition to observe Floquet replicas with light, but only around two to achieve excitonic Floquet - and with a much a stronger effect.\"\n\nToward Practical Quantum Material Design\n\nThe results show that Floquet effects are not limited to light-based techniques. They can also be generated reliably using other bosonic particles beyond photons. Excitonic Floquet engineering requires far less energy than optical methods and opens the door to a broader set of tools.\n\nIn principle, similar effects could be achieved using phonons (using acoustic vibration), plasmons (using free-floating electrons), magnons (using magnetic fields), and other excitations. Together, these possibilities move Floquet engineering closer to practical use and the reliable creation of new quantum materials and devices.\n\n\"We've opened the gates to applied Floquet physics,\" concludes study co-first author Dr. David Bacon, former OIST researcher now at the University College London, \"to a wide variety of bosons. This is very exciting, given its strong potential for creating and directly manipulating quantum materials. We don't have the recipe for this just yet - but we now have the spectral signature necessary for the first, practical steps.\"",

      "title": "A tiny spin change just flipped a famous quantum effect",
      "summary": "When quantum spins interact, they can produce collective behaviors that defy long-standing expectations. Researchers have now shown that the Kondo effect behaves very differently depending on spin size. In systems with small spins, it suppresses magnetism, but when spins are larger, it actually promotes magnetic order. This discovery uncovers a new quantum boundary with major implications for future materials.",
      "content": "In condensed matter physics, some of the most unusual behaviors appear only when many quantum particles interact as a group. A single quantum spin on its own behaves in relatively simple ways, but when spins influence each other across a material, entirely new effects can emerge. Explaining how these collective interactions arise is a central challenge in modern physics.\n\nOne of the most important collective phenomena is the Kondo effect. It describes how localized quantum spins interact with mobile electrons in a material and plays a major role in shaping the behavior of many quantum systems.\n\nWhy Studying the Kondo Effect Is So Difficult\n\nIn real materials, isolating the core physics of the Kondo effect is not easy. Electrons do not only carry spin. They also move through the material and occupy different orbitals, introducing charge motion and additional degrees of freedom. When all of these effects occur at once, it becomes difficult to separate the spin interactions that drive the Kondo effect from everything else happening in the system.\n\nTo address this complexity, physicists have long relied on simplified theoretical models. One of the most influential is the Kondo necklace model, introduced in 1977 by Sebastian Doniach. This model removes electron motion and orbital effects, leaving behind a system made entirely of interacting spins. Although it has been widely viewed as a powerful framework for exploring new quantum states, realizing it experimentally remained an open challenge for nearly fifty years.\n\nDoes Spin Size Change Quantum Behavior\n\nA fundamental question has persisted for decades. Does the Kondo effect behave the same way for all spin sizes, or does changing the size of the localized spin alter the outcome? Answering this question is critical for understanding quantum materials more broadly.\n\nA research team led by Associate Professor Hironori Yamaguchi of the Graduate School of Science at Osaka Metropolitan University has now provided an answer. The team created a new type of Kondo necklace using a carefully engineered organic inorganic hybrid material made from organic radicals and nickel ions. This precise design was achieved using RaX-D, a molecular design framework that allows fine control over crystal structure and magnetic interactions.\n\nFrom Spin One Half to Spin One\n\nThe researchers had previously succeeded in building a spin-1/2 Kondo necklace. In their latest work, they extended the system by increasing the localized spin (decollated spin) from 1/2 to 1. Thermodynamic measurements revealed a clear phase transition, showing that the system entered a magnetically ordered state.\n\nDetailed quantum analysis explained the origin of this change. The Kondo coupling creates an effective magnetic interaction between spin-1 moments, which stabilizes long range magnetic order across the material.\n\nChallenging a Longstanding View of Magnetism\n\nFor many years, the Kondo effect was thought to mainly suppress magnetism by locking spins into singlets, a maximally entangled state with zero total spin. The new results overturn this traditional picture. When the localized spin exceeds 1/2, the same Kondo interaction no longer weakens magnetism. Instead, it actively promotes magnetic order.\n\nBy directly comparing spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems within a clean, spin-only platform, the researchers identified a clear quantum boundary. The Kondo effect always forms local singlets for spin-1/2 moments, but it stabilizes magnetic order for spin-1 and higher.\n\nThis work provides the first direct experimental evidence that the role of the Kondo effect fundamentally depends on spin size.\n\nImplications for Quantum Materials and Technology\n\n\"The discovery of a quantum principle dependent on spin size in the Kondo effect opens up a whole new area of research in quantum materials,\" Yamaguchi said. \"The ability to switch quantum states between nonmagnetic and magnetic regimes by controlling the spin size represents a powerful design strategy for next-generation quantum materials.\"\n\nShowing that the Kondo effect can operate in opposite ways depending on spin size offers a new perspective on quantum matter and establishes a fresh conceptual foundation for designing spin-based quantum devices.\n\nBeing able to control whether a Kondo lattice becomes magnetic or non-magnetic is especially important for future quantum technologies. Such control could influence key properties such as entanglement, magnetic noise, and quantum critical behavior. The researchers hope their findings will guide the development of new quantum materials and eventually contribute to emerging technologies, including quantum information devices and quantum computing.",

Their findings suggest that this long-standing limit on efficiency breaks down for tiny systems governed by quantum effects. The work could help accelerate progress toward extremely small and energy-efficient quantum motors. The team published its mathematical proof in the journal Science Advances.\n\nTraditional heat engines, such as internal combustion engines and steam turbines, operate by turning thermal energy into mechanical motion, or simply converting heat into movement. Over the past several years, advances in quantum mechanics have allowed researchers to shrink heat engines to microscopic dimensions.\n\n\"Tiny motors, no larger than a single atom, could become a reality in the future,\" says Professor Eric Lutz of the Institute for Theoretical Physics I at the University of Stuttgart. \"It is now also evident that these engines can achieve a higher maximum efficiency than larger heat engines.\"\n\nProfessor Lutz and Dr. Milton Aguilar, a postdoctoral researcher at the same institute, describe the physics behind this surprising result in their Science Advances paper. In a three-question interview, they outline what they discovered and why it matters.\n\nRethinking a 200-Year-Old Efficiency Limit\n\nNearly two centuries ago, French physicist Sadi Carnot established the theoretical maximum efficiency that any heat engine can achieve. The Carnot principle, which later became part of the second law of thermodynamics, was formulated for large-scale systems such as steam turbines.\n\nThe Stuttgart researchers have now shown that this principle must be expanded when applied to systems at the atomic scale. This is especially true for strongly correlated molecular motors, where particles are closely connected in ways not accounted for in classical thermodynamics.\n\nThe Hidden Role of Quantum Correlations\n\nCarnot's original work showed that efficiency depends on temperature differences, with larger gaps between hot and cold leading to greater potential efficiency. What the classic formulation does not include is the effect of quantum correlations. These are subtle connections that arise between particles when systems become extremely small.\n\nFor the first time, the researchers derived generalized thermodynamic laws that fully incorporate these correlations. Their results reveal that atomic-scale thermal machines can convert not only heat into work but also quantum correlations themselves. Because of this added contribution, such machines can generate more work than classical theory allows, meaning the efficiency of a quantum engine can exceed the traditional Carnot limit.\n\nWhat This Means for Future Technology\n\nBeyond refining fundamental physics, the research opens new possibilities for future applications. A deeper understanding of how physical laws operate at the atomic level could speed the development of next-generation technologies, including ultra-small and highly efficient quantum motors capable of precise nanoscale tasks.\n\nSuch motors could one day power medical nanobots or guide machines that manipulate materials atom by atom. The range of potential uses is vast, highlighting how reexamining basic scientific principles can lead to entirely new technological horizons.",

      "title": "Slovak MEPs welcome the proposal for a 28th legal regime for EU businesses, but also have concerns",
      "summary": "Slovak MEP Ľudovít Ódor supported the proposal to create a 28th legal regime for innovative EU enterprises.",
      "content": "Brussels/Strasbourg – Members of the European Parliament (EP) on Tuesday (20 January) adopted a series of recommendations that are to become part of the European Commission’s proposal for a new legal framework to support innovative companies in the European Union, also known as the 28th legal regime. Some Slovak MEPs also commented on this proposal for TASR.\n\nĽudovít Ódor (PS), as the EP rapporteur for tax issues of the 28th legal regime, expressed his conviction that this proposal is a step in the right direction. “In the Union, in the last 50 years, no startup has emerged that would stay here and grow into a truly large global technology company. Winning digital markets take almost everything. They have a single market, while Europe is still playing by 27 rules on 27 playing fields. Harmonizing the rules in 27 countries would take decades, if it were even possible. If we want to succeed in global competition with the USA and China, we have to approach it differently,” he described the situation.\n\nBranislav Ondruš (Hlas-SD) expressed support for creating suitable conditions for European technological startups, but reminded that he is among those European lawmakers who express serious concerns that the 28th legal regime may threaten the sovereignty of member states in important legal matters. “I do not agree that our Labour Code should not apply to any company doing business in Slovakia, that any company could not be inspected by our Labour Inspectorate, and so on. It is not possible for some so-called special EU legal regime to allow companies in Slovakia to ignore our legal regulations that protect workers from ruthless exploitation. Even as it is, our workers often have great difficulty enforcing their rights,” said Ondruš.\n\nHe pointed out that last year he did not vote in the EP for strengthening the rights of Slovak employees in multinational corporations, only for some of them now to be relieved of their obligations towards their workers. “I have long rejected strengthening the competitiveness of our companies at the expense of employees and their families, and I certainly cannot support the spread in Europe of exploitative practices that we know from the USA. I expect the European Commission to take the comments and objections of the European Parliament very seriously, because otherwise it will face strong resistance from those MEPs who always stand on the side of workers, not corporations,” he warned.\n\nEP Vice-President Martin Hojsík (PS) welcomed the fact that the EP’s recommendations represent a positive shift on this issue. “We are finally moving forward in this area. I have long been advocating in the European Parliament for better conditions for European startups and this is an important step forward. If it is successfully completed, it will simplify startups’ access to investments, improve their functioning across all of Europe and thus prevent many of them from leaving Slovakia and the EU,” he explained.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union (EU) has many different rules across its 27 member countries, which makes it hard for new technology companies to grow big across the whole region. To help fix this, the EU is working on a new legal framework called the 28th legal regime, aimed at supporting innovative startups and making it easier for them to succeed.\n\n**What happened** – On January 20, the European Parliament adopted recommendations to create this 28th legal regime. Slovak Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) shared their views: Ľudovít Ódor supports the plan, saying it will help European startups compete globally by having one set of rules instead of 27. Meanwhile, Branislav Ondruš is concerned the new rules might let companies ignore important worker protections in Slovakia. Martin Hojsík welcomed the progress, hoping it will help startups get investments and stay in the EU.\n\n**Impact** – This new legal framework is important because it could make it much easier for startups to operate across all EU countries without dealing with many different laws. That could help European technology companies grow bigger and compete better with companies from the US and China. However, it also raises concerns about protecting workers’ rights, showing the challenge of balancing business growth with fair treatment of employees.\n\n**What's next step** – The European Commission will now consider the European Parliament’s recommendations and concerns as it develops the final proposal for the 28th legal regime. If approved, this could lead to simpler rules for startups and stronger support for innovation across Europe, but lawmakers will need to ensure workers’ rights remain protected.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU is working on a new legal framework to help innovative startups grow across member countries while carefully addressing worker protections.\n",
