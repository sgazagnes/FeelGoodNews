Civilians make up the vast majority of casualties caused by the use of explosive weapons—such as aerial bombs, rockets, missiles, and artillery and mortar projectiles—in populated areas. Explosive weapons also turn urban areas into rubble, destroy infrastructure, and damage the environment and cultural heritage.“Countries at war that use explosive weapons in populated areas kill, injure, and traumatize civilians, disrupt access to essential services, and cause mass displacement,” said Bonnie Docherty, senior arms adviser at Human Rights Watch; lecturer on law at the Harvard Human Rights Clinic; and lead author of the report. “The extensive harm recently documented in Ukraine, Gaza, Democratic Republic of Congo, and elsewhere shows that governments should intensify efforts to implement their expressed commitments to protect civilians from this method of warfare.”\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n      \n\n\n  \n          \n                                \n                \n\n\n\n      \n\n                        \n              \n        \n\n\n\n  \n    Play Video    \n  \n\n      \n                    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \nThe declaration, adopted in Dublin in 2022, is a nonbinding international instrument that seeks to prevent and remediate the devastating effects on civilians associated with using explosive weapons in cities, towns, and villages. Endorsing countries and other relevant stakeholders will meet in San José, Costa Rica, from November 18 to 20, 2025, for the declaration’s second international conference to encourage broader endorsement, review and strengthen implementation efforts, and outline next steps.The declaration says that countries that endorse it should take a variety of steps to better protect civilians, including “restricting or refraining from” the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and assisting victims of harm that has already occurred. Endorsing countries should also gather and publicly share data about the use and effects of explosive weapons that can be analyzed to learn lessons that improve civilian protection in the future.Human Rights Watch and the Harvard Human Rights Clinic urge governments to follow seven guiding principles to effectively implement the declaration’s commitments. These principles are applicable to all countries, no matter the structure of their government or size of their military.Countries that have endorsed the declaration should (1) comprehensively address the humanitarian consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, and (2) develop progressive civilian protection standards that go beyond existing international humanitarian law, Human Rights Watch and the Harvard Human Rights Clinic say in the report. Countries should also (3) collaborate with a wide range of actors; (4) ensure that all decisions are informed by relevant data; and (5) be transparent in implementation efforts. Finally, they should (6) internalize their commitments as part of their national laws and policies and (7) promote the declaration and its norms beyond the endorsing countries. “Strengthening Civilian Protection” builds on the 2022 report “Safeguarding Civilians: A Humanitarian Interpretation of the Political Declaration on the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas,” co-published by Human Rights Watch and the Harvard Human Rights Clinic, which focuses on interpreting the declaration’s provisions. Human Rights Watch is a co-founder of the International Network on Explosive Weapons (INEW), the coalition of civil society groups that helped drive creation of the declaration.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Explosive weapons like bombs, rockets, and artillery cause most injuries and deaths to civilians in cities and towns during wars. These weapons also destroy homes, roads, and important buildings, making life very hard for people living there.\n\n**What happened** – On November 17, 2025, Human Rights Watch and Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic released a report urging governments to follow new political commitments to better protect civilians from these weapons. The report offers seven clear principles to help countries that agreed to the Political Declaration on the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas, a promise made in 2022 to reduce harm to civilians. From November 18 to 20, 2025, countries will meet in San José, Costa Rica, to discuss how to strengthen these efforts.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because civilians make up most victims of explosive weapons in war. The declaration encourages countries to limit or avoid using these weapons in populated areas and to help those already harmed. The report’s principles ask governments to use data, be open about their actions, and include these protections in their laws. This can lead to safer cities during conflicts and reduce damage to communities and culture.\n\n**What's next step** – The upcoming conference in Costa Rica will review progress and push for more countries to join the declaration. Governments will share information and plan stronger ways to protect civilians. Civil society groups will also join the talks to support these goals. Over time, these efforts could lead to new international rules that better shield people from explosive weapons.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Countries are working together with clear guidelines to reduce harm to civilians from explosive weapons in war-torn cities and towns worldwide.\n",

Du 18 au 20 novembre 2025, une réunion se tiendra à San José, Costa Rica, pour discuter de l’amélioration de ces efforts.\n\n**Impact** – Cela est important car les civils représentent la majorité des victimes des armes explosives en guerre. La déclaration encourage les pays à limiter ou éviter l’usage de ces armes dans les zones peuplées et à aider les personnes déjà blessées. Les principes du rapport demandent aux gouvernements d’utiliser des données, d’être transparents sur leurs actions, et d’intégrer ces protections dans leurs lois. Cela peut rendre les villes plus sûres pendant les conflits et réduire les dégâts sur les communautés et le patrimoine.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – La conférence à Costa Rica examinera les progrès réalisés et encouragera davantage de pays à rejoindre la déclaration.

It distorts history, dehumanizes its victims and deepens the divisions that make future atrocities possible,” she added.\n\nThe Special Adviser of the Secretary-General for the Prevention of Genocide, Chaloka Beyani, called the advocacy of Ms. Subašić and the thousands of other mothers “an act of love and remembrance to the victims” and a global commitment to preventing future genocides.\n\nUN Photo/Eskinder Debebe Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed with other participants at the dedication of the \"Flower of Srebrenica\" Memorial honoring the victims of the 1995 genocide in Srebrenica.\n\nSrebrenica and Rwanda\n\nThe Flower of Srebrenica Memorial is a gift from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the UN Secretariat as part of the Srebrenica Genocide and the United Nations Outreach Programme.\n\nIt stands near another genocide memorial – the Kwibuka flame remembering the victims and survivors of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.\n\n“The monuments to the genocide committed in the heart of Europe and in the heart of Africa are witness to the truth, but also warn humanity to never again allow genocide to be repeated,” said Denis Bećirović, Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.",

The Japanese government should affirm its commitment to human rights by taking the lead in promoting civilian democratic rule and the rule of law across Asia and around the world.Prime Minister Takaichi, Japan’s first female prime minister, took office on October 21. Japan, as the only Asian member of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies, has a significant role in promoting fundamental rights and freedoms abroad, including in Cambodia, China, Myanmar, and North Korea. Japan’s longstanding official policy “puts effort into improving the global human rights situation through bilateral dialogues, proactive participation in multilateral forums such as the UN, and constructive dialogues with the UN human rights mechanisms.”“Japan has long claimed to pursue human rights diplomacy, but it has yet to take meaningful steps needed to make that a reality,” said Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch. “Prime Minister Takaichi should swiftly enact necessary measures to promote rights-respecting governance crucial for the security and well-being of people throughout Asia and elsewhere.”The new Japanese government has the opportunity to adopt a number of important measures to promote human rights, Human Rights Watch said. The government should adopt a global Magnitsky-style sanctions law, which will allow Japan to impose targeted sanctions on serious human rights abusers abroad. Japan is currently the only G7 country without such a law. The government should introduce legally binding human rights and environmental due diligence for Japanese companies to address forced labor, child labor, sexual harassment, exposure to toxic substances, retaliation for organizing, and low wages in global value chains. In addition, the government should legislate import and export bans on goods produced through means involving forced labor and deforestation.The Japanese government should also show its support and commitment to international justice and the rule of law by acceding to the Genocide Convention. It should publicly express strong support for the International Criminal Court, including by denouncing and taking measures against US government sanctions on the court and providing the court with the resources it needs to carry out its work.Other priorities for Japanese human rights diplomacy include publicly denouncing cases of transnational repression by China and other governments; increasing assistance for refugees and other vulnerable groups; and establishing a program to support human rights defenders and open civic space abroad.The Japanese government should also take up key human rights issues in specific countries, particularly in Asia. It should press the Chinese government to end its growing repression, including crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, forced assimilation in Tibet, and the erasure of freedoms in Hong Kong. Japan should also continue to raise concerns with other governments about the Myanmar junta’s proposed elections; and press the Cambodian government to lift the severe restrictions on freedom of expression, the media, peaceful assembly, and association.“As Japan’s new leader, Prime Minister Takaichi has the power to transform Japan into a global leader on human rights, both at home and abroad,” Doi said. “Despite a turbulent geopolitical climate, Prime Minister Takaichi should embrace this opportunity to adopt new laws, policies, and practices that will allow Japan to reach its human rights potential.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Japan recently appointed Sanae Takaichi as its first female prime minister on October 21, 2025. As the only Asian member of the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy nations, Japan has an important role in supporting human rights across Asia and worldwide.\n\n**What happened** – On November 6, 2025, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Prime Minister Takaichi asking her government to make human rights a key part of its foreign policy. They suggested several actions, like passing new laws to punish serious human rights violations abroad and requiring Japanese companies to prevent forced labor and environmental harm in their supply chains.\n\n**Impact** – This call is important because Japan is currently the only G7 country without a law to impose sanctions on human rights abusers. By adopting such measures, Japan could strengthen protections for people facing repression in countries like China, Myanmar, Cambodia, and North Korea. It could also support international justice by backing courts that hold criminals accountable.\n\n**What's next step** – The Japanese government can now decide to introduce these new laws and policies. This includes adopting a Magnitsky-style sanctions law, joining the Genocide Convention, supporting the International Criminal Court, and increasing help for refugees and human rights defenders.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Japan’s new prime minister has a chance to make her country a strong voice for human rights in Asia and around the world by adopting concrete policies to protect freedoms and punish abuses.",

Plusieurs actions ont été suggérées, comme l’adoption de nouvelles lois pour punir les violations graves des droits humains à l’étranger et l’obligation pour les entreprises japonaises d’empêcher le travail forcé et les dommages environnementaux dans leurs chaînes d’approvisionnement.\n\n**Impact** – Cette demande est importante car le Japon est actuellement le seul pays du G7 sans loi permettant de sanctionner les auteurs d’abus des droits humains. En adoptant ces mesures, le Japon pourrait renforcer la protection des personnes réprimées dans des pays comme la Chine, le Myanmar, le Cambodge et la Corée du Nord. Il pourrait aussi soutenir la justice internationale en appuyant les tribunaux qui jugent les criminels.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le gouvernement japonais peut désormais décider d’introduire ces nouvelles lois et politiques.
