      "content": "Madeleine Cheung in front of a model of the Voyager spacecraft during one of her visits to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Credit: Madeleine Cheung\n\nM.C.: In October 2023, two months into an America and World Relations course at my secondary school in Los Angeles, California, our teacher told us to find a mentor working in a field in which we were interested in pursuing a career.\n\nI wanted mine to be a scientist who could tell me about their day-to-day role and how they use their work to further humanity’s knowledge.\n\nBut I wasn’t sure how to find one. My teacher suggested using my existing network, such as friends’ parents. But a friend encouraged me to approach C.M., a carbon-cycle and ecosystems researcher, when he spoke to our class about his work at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), based at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. This was my first interaction with someone in environmental science, a field I hope to work in. He agreed to be my mentor.\n\nOur first virtual meeting was in May 2024, and was followed by a couple more over the summer break. We talked about how a scientist finds and publishes knowledge, which introduced me to various types of journal. We also made a plan for the upcoming school year (during which we met virtually for 30 minutes each week), focusing on the research areas I was interested in learning more about and, hopefully, contributing to.\n\nGetting started\n\nDuring our weekly meetings, we talked about C.M.’s research on Arctic tipping points (an abrupt or irreversible change into a qualitatively different state), and I gradually started to play a more active part in the sessions by finding papers and summarizing their findings. This February, I visited C.M. at JPL, where I met his colleagues, who shared their career journeys with me.\n\nAt the end of my two-year America and World Relations course, I gave a presentation reflecting on my experience with C.M., including how we met, what we did and what I learnt. His mentorship provided invaluable exposure to careers in science and gave me a real understanding of research. Tasks I completed, such as literature reviews, could form part of C.M.’s research paper on Arctic tipping points, and that has given me confidence in my ability to contribute to scientific work.\n\nThe mentorship also challenged some of my misconceptions. I had assumed that, to go into environmental science, I would need to focus on this for my bachelor’s degree. However, C.M.’s degree is in chemistry and history. This taught me that you can take various routes into science, and that your undergraduate years should be a time of exploration.\n\nI learnt that science is, first and foremost, one big group project (often a global collaboration, in fact), rather than a lonely pursuit full of technical jargon and rigid methods, which is how some of my peers perceive it.\n\nThe mentorship also introduced me to resources such as Google Scholar and the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, showing me how open science can provide free, accessible knowledge. I realized that C.M. uses some of the same tools that I used at school, such as group to-do lists and presentations to summarize work for others. As a result, science feels more attainable, and less like a far-off fantasy restricted to the most brilliant minds.\n\nMixing it up\n\nMy mentoring experience with C.M. wasn’t my only exposure to careers in science during my time at school; I also took part in the Summer High School Intensive Next-Generation Engineering program at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. As part of environmental engineer Burçin Becerik-Gerber’s research group, I worked on a project that aimed to understand how energy dashboards in residential homes can motivate people to reduce their energy usage.\n\nThe other two school students in that group were male, as were the two PhD students we worked with. Meanwhile, at school, in my combined physics and chemistry class, I was one of only two female students in a class of seven, with a male teacher.\n\nThese experiences reminded me that being a young woman in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) can seem daunting, despite the strides society has made to embrace gender equality in the STEM fields.\n\nOverall, I now feel more comfortable about stepping into a male-dominated field. I hope to use my experience to relate to and motivate girls and young women to pursue STEM-related careers.\n\nHere are three tips I would give to any secondary-school student looking to get immersed in the world of science and research.\n\nFirst, keeping an open mind allows you to step into situations and experiences that you might not have thought possible. Throughout the mentorship, I carried out tasks despite having doubts about my ability. Although it is important to have some goals in mind, having too many expectations while still at school can prevent you from reaching your potential and truly getting the most out of the journey.\n\nMentoring resources\n\nSecond, asking about the possibility of a mentorship in person, rather than digitally, such as over e-mail, makes the relationship more personable from the beginning and gives you a higher chance of receiving a follow-up. Before meeting C.M., I had reached out to three people online, but found that cold e-mailing was ineffective.\n\nLast, I found that having the support of your school, and specifically that of a teacher who can vouch for you, is indispensable in ensuring that the process goes as smoothly as possible. If other adults are already aware of your goal, it can open the door to more connections, and reassure the person you reach out to.\n\nMoving on\n\nThe world I was born into has changed from simply questioning climate change and the reasons for it to joining together to mitigate its effects. I have grown into a young woman confident in following a path of environmental advocacy through STEM. By 2030, I will have finished the undergraduate degree that I started last month, and hope to have been witness to a crucial climatic milestone: the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 45% to keep the global temperature increase under 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nBut immersing myself in professional science while still at school has convinced me that I need not be just a witness; with the right tools, I feel ready to use my voice to be a positive contributor to a more sustainable world.\n\nSecondary-school student Madeleine Cheung visited environmental scientist David Miller at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.Credit: Madeleine Cheung\n\nC.M.: My daughter attends the International School of Los Angeles, and once or twice a year I go there to talk to the science classes. I met M.C. during one of these visits.",

We’re looking for the solutions in your communities. So, you can find out more in our show notes.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, we’ve been getting a lot of submissions rolling in, and it’s been so fun to go through them with our team. Yeah, it’s really been helping us get through some pretty difficult times in terms of… the news cycle.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. Uh, the news in the past week especially has just been one of those weeks where it’s a lot to handle. There’s so much going on out in the world, and it’s just, you know, so great that the Optimist Daily can be an island of good news in a sea of very negative news. And of course, that is our mission.\n\nArielle:\n\nMhm. It’s an honor to be able to share these solutions with you and to be able to focus on something positive, especially when everything feels like. It’s… it’s kind of crumbling down around us. There are so many issues that are polarizing right now. It seems like no matter how you talk about certain events, it will just get you a lot of… Hate seems like a strong word, but unfortunately it does seem like the appropriate word to use.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah\n\nArielle:\n\nUm. So yeah, I guess that’s how we’re both feeling this week. A little overwhelmed with the negativity.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThat kind of brings us to I’m an Optimist, but… and this week it’s not “I’m an Optimist, but…” it’s “I’m an Optimist, and…” you know, I’m recentering.\n\nArielle:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nKarissa:\n\nRefocusing on what’s important.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, I know. I totally agree with you. I didn’t really want to go into the I’m an Optimist, but… because I feel like you can’t even really get into all of the negativity that’s going on without… you know, drowning in it or getting lost in it. So, I’m with you on that one. I’m an optimist, and I’m really grateful just that we can focus on these solutions. So, on that note, Karissa, what do you have to share with us today.\n\nKarissa:\n\nWell, I’m really excited about the solution. I think it was very hopeful to me. So, its title is Breaking free: the Indian retreats helping women heal from divorce and rediscover hope. I guess before we dive in, we do have a content warning because this article does touch a bit on domestic violence. If you do want to skip over, then you can go ahead to Arielle’s solution.\n\nArielle:\n\nGood to know.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI was really optimistic from seeing this because India’s first divorce camp is a retreat founded by 31-year-old Rafia Afi to help women who are divorced, separated, widowed, or struggling in toxic marriages. And she says that the idea is to normalize divorce and give it dignity.\n\nArielle:\n\nI mean, divorce can be a great thing, but I know there’s still so much stigma out there for divorcees, especially for women.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. And Afi knows the weight of stigma firsthand, because after her first divorce, she began sharing her healing journey and single parenting stories online. And she said that many people connected with that and began messaging her. She said that it was disturbing to realize that not everyone had the support system that she did, and most of them faced judgment and couldn’t speak up.\n\nArielle:\n\nMhm.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThat realization inspired Break Free Stories, a series of nature -themed weekend camps across Kerala.\n\nArielle:\n\nSuch a great idea. It’s so fascinating. This sounds like a really fun retreat, but do participants have to pay for them? Is there, like, a high price tag?\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. So, it’s a very modest fee, or sometimes it’s free for those who can’t afford it, and 15 to 20 women gather at these retreats for games, hikes, music, and storytelling. The aim is simple yet profound: to build a safe space where strangers become friends, and shame transforms into strength here.\n\nArielle:\n\nHmm, that sounds really great. And it seems like a place for women to reclaim their stories, reclaim their sense of self, and reclaim their narrative.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, absolutely. And it goes even deeper than this because legal guidance is also provided here. Zaki J., who is a musician and lawyer, first joined to lead music sessions here. But she soon found that many participants needed legal guidance, most especially survivors of domestic violence. So, she explains that I started conducting legal sessions to bridge that gap, and the objective is to break societal norms around gender abuse and educate every woman on her rights. And her advocacy is actually personal because she says that her mother died at the hands of her father, which pushed her to become an advocate. Today, she uses her voice to ensure that others can take the right step at the right time.\n\nArielle:\n\nWow, that is so powerful that she came out of such a horrible, horrible situation and is now using that story, even though it’s so filled with sadness…\n\nKarissa:\n\nYes.\n\nArielle:\n\n…To, like, help inspire change for other women experiencing something similar. So yeah, great to hear that they’re not just providing, you know, emotional support and community, but also essential assistance for this matter. Because domestic violence is obviously a serious problem across the world, and it’s not as simple as just divorcing a violent partner to solve the issue.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. And I mean, the urgency couldn’t be clearer. According to India’s National Family Health Survey, 32% of married women aged 18 to 49 report domestic violence, which is just… Breaks my heart. But cultural norms in India still pressure many to stay in harmful marriages. Afi warns that too many people see separation as shameful, choosing death over divorce. And society romanticizes silent suffering, and that’s dangerous. So, she says that she really wants to change that narrative.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, those statistics are just really, really disheartening. And yeah, more than that, it’s so painful because you know that for everyone that speaks out or for everyone that, like, reports, there are so many that don’t. But yeah, there’s so much work to be done to change this narrative in India and beyond, but it seems like these divorce retreats are really making a difference to participants.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. And participants do say that the retreats are actually life-changing.\n\nOne described her divorce as traumatic until the camp helped her release years of bottled-up emotions. And she says, “We cried, we laughed, and I let out all my emotions for the first time in 15 years.” And, you know, she says that we realized divorce can be freeing. Another attendee found sisterhood and understanding through listening to other people’s stories. She says, “Earlier I was gloomy and depressed. Now I feel motivated to move forward within a day. We became like sisters.”\n\nArielle:\n\nI love to see the powerful bond of sisterhood making a real difference for these women, and it really makes me appreciate my own sisters. And I know you have a sister, too. Karissa.\n\nKarissa:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nArielle:\n\nIt’s so strange that divorce has such a stigma. Like, whenever my friends go through breakups, I know that it’s really sad, but I also try to, umm, like, congratulate them in a way, because in the end they are making a decision for themselves and most likely for the other person to free themselves and open themselves to a partner or a love or a lifestyle that just aligns with them better. So, I think it really is a triumph for people to go through it.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. I mean, I think divorce can be so good for both partners and for entire families. The demand for Break Free Stories is growing rapidly, actually, and Afi plans to expand the retreats to more cities in India, and she’s creating more English -language content to reach wider audiences.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, amazing. Sounds like this has the potential to reach far beyond the borders of India. Yeah, which is already a huge country.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. As Afi says, divorce is not an end. It’s the beginning. So, I think this is just beautiful that these women are, you know, providing the support network for other women. Congratulations to them. And I hope that it continues to be successful and make a real difference. And on that note, if you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, we’ve included some links in the show notes to give you some support resources. There’s a couple of hotlines for in the US and India. And if you’re outside of those countries, there’s a website called befrienders.org that will help you find international hotlines and support resources in your country.\n\nArielle:\n\nAmazing. Yeah, we will definitely link those in the show notes so that they are easy to find. All right, your solution has to do with the stigma of divorce. Mine is actually addressing the stigma of aging.\n\nKarissa:\n\nOK, well, I’m glad that both our solutions are addressing some prominent stigmas.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, and I know that this is maybe not as, like, well, I don’t know. I don’t want to say that it’s not as extreme as what your solution was tackling. Because there are a lot of negative feelings about aging, and I don’t think that that just comes naturally. It… it also comes from society.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nI am not old. I am in my 30s though, so I’m not necessarily the youngest. And there was always this fear growing up about, you know, reaching 20s.\n\nKarissa:\n\nMhm.\n\nArielle:\n\nReaching 30s. You almost reach these milestones with dread, especially as a woman.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nAnd all of the advertisements make you think about how to make yourself look younger and how much better that is, if you present as younger. So, it’s given me kind of weird feelings about aging. I don’t know how you feel about it.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, I mean, similar to you, I think ever since we were young… I mean, I remember being young and thinking 20 is so old, and you know, your life is practically over at 20, which is so far from the truth. But especially like with the beauty industry, there’s so much focus on, you know, trying to look younger. There’s so much like plastic surgery going on right now to make people look, you know, super youthful, and just skin care, like, no wrinkles, blah blah. So that’s a huge thing that’s still so prominent in our society. So, there is a lot of negative talk around aging, but I think it could be a beautiful thing, and I do think there has been kind of a shift recently with more people online to talk about, you know, it does get better when you’re older. People are just like, you know, I’m in my 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s.\n\nArielle:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nKarissa:\n\nJust really living my best life.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, I think the messaging is changing a little bit, and I’m really grateful for that, and it’s good to see and hear other people’s stories when they’re at all of these different ages and see how much they’re thriving. Yeah, aging can be a beautiful thing, and that is what my solution is about.\n\nAs a society, it has felt like we’ve collectively decided that growing older means becoming invisible or irrelevant, especially in Western culture. But that’s not what the data shows at all, which is, like I said, what this article I’m going to be talking about dives into, and it’s titled 7 science-backed benefits of getting older you might not expect.\n\nKarissa:\n\nAh, I love it. Some benefits. Let’s hear it!\n\nArielle:\n\nAll right, so as psychologist Michelle Feng puts it, everyone talks about aging as this decline. But aging is just living. It literally means that you’re alive, and once you shift your mindset from loss to possibility, it turns out there’s a lot to look forward to. So, the first point is, stress doesn’t run the show anymore. It’s not that older adults don’t have stress, they definitely do, but their relationship to stress actually improves.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThat kind of surprises me because I would have guessed the opposite, that, you know, more years, more worries.\n\nArielle:\n\nHmm, that’s a fair assumption, and I honestly thought that way too. But studies have shown that people in their 60s. And beyond are better at managing stress. Aanand Naik, who directs the Conservatorium on Aging at UT Health Houston, explains it like this. Older people have a lot more ability to understand stressful or difficult circumstances, and they’re actually less reactive.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. I mean, it’s not that life gets easier. It’s just that we get better at life and rolling with the punches, it sounds like.\n\nArielle:\n\nExactly. One study found that adults between 65 and 84 had lower stress hormone levels and calmer heart rates than people in their 20s.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThat makes a lot of sense because as someone in their 20s, I do feel like I’m stressed out all the time and for no good reason. I mean, sometimes there is, but it makes me very hopeful about aging to a point where I won’t be as stressed.\n\nArielle:\n\nAnd your heart rate will, like, slow down a little bit. If you think about it, like when we’re in our 20s and when we’re younger in life, we’re assuming that we have, like, decades and decades of life left to provide for ourselves and, like, have to figure it out. And then the older you get, the less time stretches out before you.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nSo then you have, I guess, less to worry about in terms of having to, like, save all this money and, like, make sure you’re going to be OK for retirement and all of that is kind of… maybe not 100% figured out, but like more figured out.\n\nAnother thing is that emotions get easier to handle. Older adults report stronger emotional resilience, they’re better at holding on to the good.\n\nKarissa:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nArielle:\n\nAnd letting go of the bad.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. Well, it kind of sounds like the emotional version of work smarter, not harder.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, it kind of is. Feng and Naik both say older people are more likely to reframe situations rather than suppress emotions, which can lead to better overall well-being.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. And I feel like that kind of goes hand in hand with the stress point that you made about carrying less, you know, not in a bad way, but it’s just easier to roll with it.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, and it’s easier to stay present, I suppose, which is like, yeah. Basically, all mindfulness practice is all about just being in the moment. So yeah, maybe there’s more of that to look forward to.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nArielle:\n\nAnother point is that knowledge becomes wisdom. Your memory for names or where you left your keys might take a hit. With. Age, but other kinds of intelligence, like vocabulary, experience, and big-picture thinking, often get sharper. This is what’s called crystallized intelligence. Feng describes that as your deep knowledge base. And it actually improves with time. In one study out of Japan, older adults outperformed younger ones in ecological knowledge. How the environment and natural systems work.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI mean, our whole lives are just one giant project and database and events. And I know that across indigenous communities, elderhood is seen as a position of leadership and cultural preservation because, you know, they know all these stories and years and years of wisdom. So, it’s not just poetic; it’s practical.\n\nArielle:\n\nMhmm. Another thing is that you stop caring what people think in a good way, and this is definitely what I’ve heard from older friends.\n\nKarissa:\n\nMhmm.\n\nArielle:\n\nAs we get older, we care less about outside opinions, and there’s a theory called socioemotional selectivity that explains it. Basically, when people feel like their time is more limited, they prioritize what matters now. So, I guess that random guy across the street who thinks you are weird just doesn’t matter.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, I mean that makes a lot of sense. It’s less about the next promotion and more about meaningful conversations or a great cup of coffee with a friend.\n\nArielle:\n\nFeng puts it beautifully. How much time you feel you have left actually shapes what you focus on, which is kind of what I was touching on earlier. That leads to a deeper appreciation of the present.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. Since, you know, Arielle, I’m kind of curious… just talking about aging and our bodily functions and stuff. There’s a stereotype I’d love to bust. Does intimacy actually decline with age?\n\nArielle:\n\nOh, this is a good and spicy question, but before I go further into this part, for listeners to know, this point acknowledges the existence of sex. Nothing graphic or anything. But in case it’s best for you or someone you’re listening with to not encounter that topic today, then feel free to skip ahead a couple minutes. But back to your question, Karissa.\n\nKarissa:\n\nMhmm.\n\nArielle:\n\nThankfully, the answer is not necessarily. Naik says that for many in long-term relationships, sex actually improves in their 50s and beyond.\n\nKarissa:\n\nOh my gosh. Improves. That’s… that’s cool! Great.\n\nArielle:\n\nIn fact, studies show that women between 55 and 80 often report greater orgasm satisfaction.\n\nKarissa:\n\nWow!\n\nArielle:\n\nEven if physical arousal shifts. So, the story is a lot more nuanced than just everything slows down.\n\nKarissa:\n\nWell, that’s good news. I remember in high school one of my teachers, who was, you know, older… I had him for one of my psychology classes. So, sex was talked about, and the psychology of sex. But I do remember him saying, like, sex does not slow down just because you’re old. Like my wife and I still get it on or whatever. As high schoolers especially, that cracked us up. It doesn’t stop, and it’s nice to hear, especially for women, that it might even get better.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, maybe we’re just more inclined to ask for exactly what we want, you know.\n\nKarissa:\n\nTrue. Because it sounds like the theme of this is, you know, you know what you want and you…\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah. You prioritize it. Another point is that happiness doesn’t peak when you’re young.\n\nIt is often thought that your younger years, your 20s, your 30s, whatever. These are like the happiest years of your life. But it doesn’t just rebound after midlife. It actually can keep climbing. Many older adults actually report midlife as one of their happiest phases, and satisfaction often grows in the 60s and 70s. It’s not a U-curve anymore; it’s more like a steady incline for a lot of people.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI love that, and it makes me really hopeful that hopefully my life never peaks. It’s always just like on a good incline, and every day, year, decade keeps getting better and better.\n\nArielle:\n\nThat’s a great mindset to have, because that’s actually the last point. Mindset might be the secret. Ultimately, how you think about aging can shape how you experience it. And that’s not just a nice idea. It’s also backed by science.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYes, I love this. I’ve heard this before, that our beliefs about aging can become self-fulfilling and you know, kind of beliefs about other things too. We have this one article in our archive at the Optimist Daily that I really love. That gratitude can boost your longevity, which is awesome, and so can so many other things just related to your mindset.\n\nArielle:\n\nYes, Feng warns that if people think depression is a normal part of aging, then they might not get help. But on the flip side, people with a positive outlook on aging live, get this, an average of 7.5 years longer.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThat’s actually pretty significant.\n\nArielle:\n\nProbably has something to do with the gratitude thing as well, because if people have a positive outlook on aging, then they’re probably also putting a positive spin on, you know, just their everyday life.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nArielle:\n\nIt shows that perspective isn’t just fluff; it’s a tool. And it’s a really powerful one.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, yeah, that’s a great point and I love that.\n\nArielle:\n\nWrinkles happen, but alongside them there’s more calm, more connection, more wisdom, and maybe even more joy. Getting older might just be one of the best things that happens to you, and I hope it is for me!\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, me too. And honestly, this whole solution gives me so much hope. And I’ll take the laugh lines if it means more emotional clarity and less stress in my life.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah. Same. So, here’s to aging, not as a decline. But as an incline, or a deepening!\n\nKarissa:\n\nAnd also one more note, just on our mindset and perspective, this all ties in so beautifully to focusing on the positive news and solutions and optimism. There’s a lot of other stories on the Optimist Daily to help you keep that positive mindset.\n\nArielle:\n\nYes, and they include. The power of pumpkin: Nutritional benefits and delicious ways to enjoy.\n\nYeah, I guess it is that season now.\n\nKarissa:\n\nPumpkin spice season!\n\nArielle:\n\nKoala comeback: new national park and vaccine offer hope for Australia’s iconic marsupial, How the Chicago River went from dumping ground to eco destination, and From lack to abundance: shake off your scarcity mindset with these expert-backed tips. What else do we have Karissa?\n\nKarissa:\n\nWe have, Want to boost birthrates? Research says men need to do their part at home, Ovarian cancer symptoms you shouldn’t ignore: what to watch for and how to lower your risk, Mexico’s jaguar numbers rise: conservation sparks a 30 percent increase, and Is chlorophyll the miracle supplement TikTok claims… or just pricey green water?\n\nArielle:\n\nAll right. Well, hopefully all these solutions will carry everyone through their weekend and the rest of their week,\n\nKarissa:\n\nI have to say this round of the solutions really got me in a positive mood, so I hope it got all of our listeners to feel a little more optimistic about what’s going on out there in the world. And we can’t wait to be back next week with even more solutions.\n\nArielle:\n\nAll right, until then, bye!\n\nKarissa:\n\nBye!\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Niger activist Ibrahim Oumarou Yacouba fights to make so-called ‘fifth wives’ heard",
      "summary": "Some communities experience social and economic discrimination. Such is the case for the Wahaya, women whose parents often sell them at a young age to join households as “fifth wives.”",
      "content": "In Niger, some communities experience severe discrimination, making them socially and economically invisible. Such is the case for the Wahaya, women whose parents often sell them at a young age to join households as “fifth wives.”\n\nIbrahim Oumarou Yacouba, a Nigerien activist and expert in discriminated community rights, has made human rights a personal cause. Since 2021, he has worked with the Global Forum of Communities Discriminated on Work and Descent (GFoD), an international platform founded in New York in 2019 that defends the rights of discriminated communities that are victims of work- and descent-based discrimination.\n\nIn an email interview with Global Voices, he explained why a public debate is necessary to improve these women’s rights.\n\nJoel Hevi (JH): How do these social inequalities play out in the everyday lives of the affected communities?\n\nIbrahim Oumarou Yacouba (IOY) : Au Niger, le système de castes, bien que variable selon les groupes ethniques, demeure une réalité sociale dans certaines communautés où les rôles sociaux sont hiérarchisés et prédéfinis. Chez les Touaregs, les Peuls et dans d’autres groupes, certaines personnes subissent des discriminations proches de la servitude moderne, sans accès à la terre, ni au mariage avec les castes dites “nobles”. Ces hiérarchies fixées à la naissance reposent souvent sur l’activité traditionnelle de différentes classes, comme les Imajaghan (nobles), les Ineslemen (guerriers), les Imrad (artisans) et les Iklan (esclaves). Les esclaves, considérés comme inférieurs, ont très peu de droits. Leur travail est par ailleurs stigmatisé. Ils exercent souvent dans des secteurs dévalorisés, comme la préparation des peaux ou la forge, des métiers considérés comme de “basse caste”. Cette exclusion se traduit également par une marginalisation politique.\n\nIbrahim Oumarou Yacouba (IOY): In Niger, although the caste system varies by ethnic group, some communities still have a social reality with hierarchical and predefined social roles. Among the Tuaregs, Fulas, and other ethnic groups, some people experience discrimination akin to modern slavery, with no access to land or the right to marry the so-called ‘noble’ castes. These hierarchies, established at birth, often derive from the traditional occupations of the different classes, such as the Imajaghan (nobles), Ineslemen (warriors), Imrad (craftsmen), and the Iklan (slaves). Slaves, who are considered inferior, have very few rights, and their work is stigmatized. They often work in undervalued sectors, like hide preparation or blacksmithing, trades considered ‘low caste.’ This exclusion also results in political marginalization.\n\nJH: Who are the Wahaya, and why is their reality hidden?\n\nIOY : Le système Wahaya occupe une place très particulière dans la société nigérienne. Du point de vue de l’Islam, un homme peut avoir jusqu’à quatre épouses légalement reconnues. Au Niger, certaines pratiques contournent cette règle et tolèrent la présence d’une « cinquième épouse », appelée “Wahaya“. Certains n'hésitent pas à se procurer un sixième ou septième femme. La femmes Wahaya a un statut spécifique: elle n'est pas considérée comme une épouse au sens légal du terme. Elle est souvent perçue comme un « cadeau »; elle arrive dans la famille pour s’occuper des besoins du mari, des enfants, voire des autres épouses, sans pour autant bénéficier des droits et protections liés au mariage officiel. Il n’existe pas d’âge fixe pour devenir Wahaya. Nous avons rencontré des femmes âgées comme des mineures, âgées parfois seulement de 12 ou 13 ans. Ces femmes travaillent souvent toute la journée pour subvenir aux besoins du foyer. Certaines ont des enfants avec le mari. Pourtant, ces enfants ne bénéficient pas des mêmes droits que ceux issus du mariage légal. Ils sont eux aussi victimes de discrimination sociale et juridique, héritant de la marginalisation subie par leur mère\n\nIOY: The Wahaya practice holds a unique position in Nigerien society. From an Islamic perspective, a man can have up to four legally recognized wives. In Niger, some practices bypass this rule and condone the presence of a ‘fifth wife,” known as a ‘Wahaya.’ Some have no hesitation in obtaining a sixth or even a seventh wife. The Wahaya have a specific status. They are not considered wives in the legal sense. They are often seen as a ‘gift.’ They come to the family to attend to the husband’s, the children’s, and even the other wives’ needs, but don’t have the rights and protection of an official marriage. There is no set age for becoming a Wahaya. We have met some women who were as young as 12 or 13. These women often work all day supporting their households. Although some have children with their husbands, these children don’t have the same rights as those from a legal marriage. The children are also victims of social and legal discrimination, inheriting the marginalization that their mothers experience.\n\nJH: What are the obstacles preventing these marginalized voices from being heard?\n\nIOY: À la première Conférence internationale sur les communautés discriminées sur le travail et l’ascendance (CDWD) en Afrique, tenue début avril à Accra, nous avons été mobilisés autour des Objectifs de Développement Durable (ODD) avec une centaine de participants, universitaires et activistes venus de plusieurs pays qui ont dénoncé la persistance des discriminations liées à l’ascendance. Dans mon pays, les personnes que nous défendons, victimes de discriminations profondes, n’ont pas un accès suffisant aux soins de santé. Les infrastructures médicales sont rares ou éloignées de leurs lieux de vie, les traitements sont coûteux. Ces populations ne disposent souvent pas d’un emploi stable leur permettant de couvrir ces dépenses. Par ailleurs, la question de l’égalité des genres est au cœur des discussions. Beaucoup revendiquent un traitement égalitaire entre hommes et femmes, mais certains résistent encore à cette idée, jugeant inacceptable que les femmes bénéficient des mêmes droits et opportunités que les hommes. Nous défendons fermement le droit au travail décent et inclusif, accessible à toutes et tous. Historiquement au Niger, il faut reconnaître que ces populations marginalisées n’ont jamais réellement eu la chance d’accéder à l’éducation ou à la formation, conditions indispensables pour s’épanouir. Le véritable enjeu est donc de garantir des opportunités équitables de formation et d’emploi, afin que chaque individu puisse pleinement participer à la société.\n\nIOY: At Africa’s first international conference on Communities Discriminated on Work and Descent (CDWD), held in Accra at the beginning of April 2025, we discussed [United Nation’s] Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a hundred or so participants, academics, and activists from several countries that denounced the ongoing descent-based discrimination. In my country, the people we defend, victims of deep-rooted discrimination, don’t have sufficient healthcare access. Medical facilities are scarce or far from their home, and treatments are expensive. These people often don’t have stable employment, enabling them to cover their expenses. Gender equality is also at the center of this debate. Although many call for the equal treatment of women and men, some still oppose this notion, deeming it unacceptable that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men. We firmly defend the right to decent, inclusive, and accessible work for all. We must recognize that, historically in Niger, these marginalized groups have never really had the chance to access education or training, which are prerequisites for development. Therefore, the real challenge is ensuring equal training and employment opportunities that enable everyone to participate fully in society.\n\nJH: Do any particular stories stand out in your research?\n\nIOY : Quand j’écoute les récits des femmes Wahaya, ce qui me frappe, c’est leur résilience. Ces histoires bouleversent. Je documente quelques-unes de ces histoires, notamment celle d’une femme qui m’a confié qu’elle avait été vendue à l’âge de 12 ans à un commerçant par son propre oncle. Elle ne voulait pas que cela se sache, car parler, c’est risquer les représailles. Elle n’a jamais été mariée mais “offerte” comme une marchandise, sans dot, sans cérémonie, sans droits. Depuis, elle vit dans une servitude déguisée. Elle travaille jour et nuit, s’occupe de la maison, des enfants du maître, des autres femmes, et n’a pas le droit de dire non. Elle a eu des enfants, mais eux aussi sont privés de tout statut légal. Aujourd’hui, cette femme a environ 25 ans. Elle continue de vivre dans un système où la parole des femmes comme elle reste encore largement étouffée. J’ai aussi rencontré lors d’une exposition sur les séquelles de l’esclavage, Moussa, fils d’une Wahaya, qui a perdu un œil suite à une punition. Il avait perdu une bête en conduisant le troupeau de son maître, et a été battu si violemment qu’il a perdu un œil. Son témoignage montre la cruauté systémique à laquelle ces personnes font face. Il y a aussi Hadizatou Mani-Karoau, une Wahaya dont le parcours est aujourd’hui un symbole de lutte pour de nombreuses femmes nigériennes voire africaines. Elle s’est battue pour sa liberté et elle y est parvenue, grâce notamment au soutien de l’association Timidria, qui l’a aidée à retrouver ses droits. Ces histoires sont douloureuses, mais elles montrent que malgré les violences et l’oppression, il y a des lueurs d’espoir. Grâce au travail d’activistes, d’associations, notamment l'Étude sur l’esclavage au Niger : témoignages, manifestations et causes, et d’initiatives comme le GFOD Inclusivity Project, le combat pour l’égalité et pour les droits humains continue.\n\nIOY: When I listen to the Wahaya’s stories, I am amazed at their resilience. These stories are moving. I documented some of these stories, including one about a woman who told me her uncle sold her to a trader at age 12. She didn’t want anyone to know for fear of reprisal. She was never married but ‘offered’ as a commodity, without a dowry, ceremony, or rights. Since then, she has been living in veiled servitude. She works night and day, taking care of the house, the master’s children, and the other women. She isn’t allowed to say no. She has children, but they also don’t have a legal status. She is now about 25 years old and continues to live in a system where women’s voices like hers are largely stifled. During an exhibition on the legacy of slavery, I also met Moussa, the son of a Wahaya, who lost an eye due to a punishment. He had lost an animal while herding his master’s flock, and was beaten so violently that he lost an eye. His story illustrates the systemic cruelty that these people experience. There is also Hadizatou Mani-Karoau, a Wahaya whose story now symbolizes many Nigerien and African women’s struggles. Thanks to the support of the Timidria association, which helped her regain her rights, she fought for her freedom and succeeded. Although these stories are harrowing, they show that there are glimpses of hope despite the violence and oppression. The fight for equality and human rights continues through the work of activists and associations, such as The Study on Slavery in Niger: Testimonies, Manifestations, and Causes, and initiatives like the GFOD Inclusivity Project.\n\nJH: Does the data collection reflect the realities of the discriminated groups?\n\nIOY : En tant que chercheur au sein du GFOD Inclusivity Project, j’ai été confronté à des obstacles, mais je m’efforce de les surmonter. Il faut dire que le sujet que je porte reste un tabou profond. Dans bien des communautés, on refuse d’en parler. Pas par ignorance, mais parce que ceux qui s’y opposent sont souvent ceux qui en tirent profit. Je crois profondément que mener un combat juste nous accorde une forme de protection spirituelle. C’est une conviction intime. Lorsque tu défends la dignité humaine, il y a quelque chose de plus grand qui te soutient. Alors, malgré les menaces, je continue. Mon combat se mène sur plusieurs fronts en utilisant la musique, la médiation culturelle et le droit international comme leviers pour faire entendre les voix réduites au silence et sensibiliser sur les injustices. Mais mon message ne s’arrête pas aux frontières de mon pays. Car cette réalité de l’esclavage par ascendance, on la retrouve aussi ailleurs. Je m’investis aussi sur le plan académique en écrivant et compilan les témoignages. Sur le plan politique, nous appelons à des mécanismes de protection plus inclusifs. Nous essayons d’apporter notre pierre à l’édifice pour que demain, plus personne ne soit réduit au silence à cause de ses origines. Pour que plus aucun enfant ne naisse esclave d’un système qu’il n’a pas choisi.",
