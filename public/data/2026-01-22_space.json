      "content": "Scientists at Aarhus University have overturned a long-standing assumption about how life's essential ingredients emerge. New experiments show that the basic components needed to build proteins can form naturally in space, a finding that increases the likelihood that life could exist elsewhere in the universe.\n\nThe research was carried out at advanced laboratories at Aarhus University and at a European research facility in Hungary (HUN-REN Atomki). The experiments were led by researchers Sergio Ioppolo and Alfred Thomas Hopkinson.\n\nRecreating the Extreme Conditions of Interstellar Space\n\nInside a specially designed chamber, the researchers recreated the harsh environment found in vast clouds of cosmic dust located thousands of light-years from Earth. These regions are among the coldest and emptiest places in the universe.\n\nTemperatures in such dust clouds reach about -260°C, and pressure is so low that researchers must constantly remove stray gas particles to maintain an ultra-high vacuum. Under these carefully controlled conditions, the team studied how particles behave when exposed to radiation, closely matching what happens in real interstellar space.\n\n\"We already know from earlier experiments that simple amino acids, like glycine, form in interstellar space. But we were interested in discovering if more complex molecules, like peptides, form naturally on the surface of dust grains before those take part in the formation of stars and planets,\" Sergio Ioppolo says.\n\nFrom Amino Acids to Protein Precursors\n\nPeptides are short chains made when individual amino acids link together. When many peptides bond, they form proteins, which are essential for life as we know it. Identifying where and how these protein precursors originate is a key step in understanding how life might begin.\n\nTo test this process, the researchers placed glycine inside the chamber and exposed it to simulated cosmic rays using an ion accelerator at HUN-REN Atomki. They then analyzed the chemical reactions that followed.\n\n\"We saw that the glycine molecules started reacting with each other to form peptides and water. This indicates that the same process occurs in interstellar space,\" Alfred Thomas Hopkinson says. \"This is a step toward proteins being created on dust particles, the same materials that later form rocky planets.\"\n\nStar-Forming Clouds as Chemical Factories\n\nIoppolo, Hopkinson, and their colleagues focus on giant dust clouds between stars because these regions are where new solar systems are born. For decades, scientists believed that only very simple molecules could form in these environments.\n\n\"We used to think that only very simple molecules could be created in these clouds. The understanding was that more complex molecules formed much later, once the gases had begun coalescing into a disc that eventually becomes a star,\" Sergio Ioppolo explains.\n\n\"But we have shown that this is clearly not the case.\"\n\nThis shift in understanding suggests that key life-related molecules are much more widespread throughout the universe than previously thought.\n\nImplications for Life Beyond Earth\n\nAs interstellar dust clouds collapse, they eventually give rise to stars and planets. During this process, tiny chemical building blocks can be delivered to newly formed rocky worlds.\n\n\"Eventually, these gas clouds collapse into stars and planets. Bit by bit, these tiny building blocks land on rocky planets within a newly formed solar system. If those planets happen to be in the habitable zone, then there is a real probability that life might emerge,\" Sergio Ioppolo says.\n\n\"That said, we still don't know exactly how life began. But research like ours shows that many of the complex molecules necessary for life are created naturally in space.\"\n\nA Chemical Process That Works Everywhere\n\nAt first glance, the formation of peptides from simple amino acids might seem like a small step. However, the chemical reaction that links amino acids together follows the same basic rules everywhere, making the discovery especially important.\n\n\"All types of amino acids bond into peptides through the same reaction. It is, therefore, very likely that other peptides naturally form in interstellar space as well,\" says Hopkinson. \"We haven't looked into this yet, but we are likely to do so in the future.\"\n\nSearching for Other Ingredients of Life\n\nProteins are only part of the picture. Life also depends on membranes, nucleobases, and nucleotides. Whether these components can also form naturally in space is still an open question.\n\nResearchers at the Center for Interstellar Catalysis, funded by The Danish National Research Foundation, are continuing to investigate these possibilities.\n\n\"These molecules are some of the key building blocks of life,\" explained co-author Professor Liv Hornekær, the InterCat center leader. \"They might actively participate in early prebiotic chemistry, catalyzing further reactions that lead toward life.\"\n\n\"There's still a lot to be discovered, but our research team is working on answering as many of these basic questions as possible,\" Sergio Ioppolo says. \"We've already discovered that many of the building blocks of life are formed out there, and we'll likely find more in the future.\"",

      "summary": "Solar Orbiter has captured the clearest evidence yet that a solar flare grows through a cascading “magnetic avalanche.” Small, weak magnetic disturbances rapidly multiplied, triggering stronger and stronger explosions that accelerated particles to extreme speeds. The process produced streams of glowing plasma blobs that rained through the Sun’s atmosphere long after the flare itself.",
      "content": "Much like a snow avalanche that starts with a small shift before cascading downhill, new observations show that solar flares begin with subtle magnetic disturbances that rapidly intensify. Scientists using the European Space Agency (ESA) led Solar Orbiter spacecraft discovered that these early changes can quickly grow into violent eruptions, producing a dramatic cascade of glowing plasma blobs that fall through the Sun's atmosphere long after the main flare has peaked.\n\nThis insight comes from one of the most detailed views ever captured of a large solar flare. The event was recorded during Solar Orbiter's close pass by the Sun on 30 September 2024 and is described in a study published today (January 21) in Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nWhat Triggers a Solar Flare\n\nSolar flares are among the most powerful explosions in the solar system. They occur when enormous amounts of energy stored in twisted magnetic fields are suddenly released through a process known as magnetic reconnection. During reconnection, magnetic field lines pointing in opposite directions break apart and reconnect in a new configuration. This rapid rearrangement can heat plasma to millions of degrees and hurl energized particles away from the site, creating a solar flare.\n\nThe strongest flares can set off a chain reaction that reaches Earth, triggering geomagnetic storms and sometimes disrupting radio communications. Because of these potential impacts, scientists are eager to understand exactly how flares begin and evolve.\n\nFor years, the precise mechanism behind the Sun's ability to release such vast energy in minutes remained unclear. Now, a rare combination of observations from four Solar Orbiter instruments working together has provided the most complete picture yet of how a flare unfolds from its earliest moments.\n\nA Rare Look at the Birth of a Solar Flare\n\nSolar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) captured remarkably detailed images of the Sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, resolving features only a few hundred kilometers across and recording changes every two seconds. At the same time, three additional instruments, SPICE, STIX and PHI, studied different layers of the Sun, from the hot corona down to the visible surface, or photosphere.\n\nTogether, these observations allowed scientists to track the buildup to the flare over roughly 40 minutes, an opportunity that rarely occurs due to limited observing windows and onboard data constraints.\n\n\"We were really very lucky to witness the precursor events of this large flare in such beautiful detail,\" says Pradeep Chitta of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Göttingen, Germany, and lead author of the paper. \"Such detailed high-cadence observations of a flare are not possible all the time because of the limited observational windows and because data like these take up so much memory space on the spacecraft's onboard computer. We really were in the right place at the right time to catch the fine details of this flare.\"\n\nMagnetic Avalanche in Action\n\nWhen EUI began observing the region at 23:06 Universal Time (UT), about 40 minutes before the flare reached its peak, it revealed a dark, arch shaped filament made of twisted magnetic fields and plasma. This structure was connected to a cross shaped pattern of magnetic field lines that gradually grew brighter. (See video link below article.)\n\nClose up views showed that new magnetic strands appeared in nearly every image frame, roughly every two seconds or less. Each strand remained confined by magnetic forces and gradually twisted, resembling tightly wound ropes.\n\nAs more strands formed and twisted, the region became unstable. Like an avalanche gaining momentum, the magnetic structures began breaking and reconnecting in rapid succession. This triggered a spreading chain of disruptions, each one stronger than the last, visible as sudden bursts of brightness.\n\nAt 23:29 UT, a particularly intense brightening occurred. Soon after, the dark filament detached on one side and shot outward, unrolling violently as it moved. Bright flashes of reconnection appeared along its length in extraordinary detail as the main flare erupted around 23:47 UT.\n\n\"These minutes before the flare are extremely important and Solar Orbiter gave us a window right into the foot of the flare where this avalanche process began,\" says Pradeep. \"We were surprised by how the large flare is driven by a series of smaller reconnection events that spread rapidly in space and time.\"\n\nSolar Flares as Cascading Chain Reactions\n\nScientists have long suggested that avalanches could explain the collective behavior of countless small flares on the Sun and other stars. Until now, it was unclear whether the same idea applied to a single, large flare.\n\nThese new results show that a major flare does not have to be one unified explosion. Instead, it can emerge from many smaller reconnection events that interact and build on one another, forming a powerful cascade.\n\nRaining Plasma Blobs\n\nUsing combined measurements from the SPICE and STIX instruments, the research team was able to study how this rapid sequence of reconnection events deposits energy into the uppermost layers of the Sun's atmosphere with unprecedented detail.\n\nHigh energy X rays played a key role in this analysis, as they reveal where accelerated particles release their energy. Because such particles can escape into space and pose risks to satellites, astronauts, and even technologies on Earth, understanding their behavior is essential for predicting space weather.\n\nDuring the 30 September flare, ultraviolet and X ray emissions were already slowly increasing when SPICE and STIX began their observations. As the flare intensified, X ray output surged dramatically, accelerating particles to speeds of 40 to 50 percent of the speed of light, or roughly 431 to 540 million km/h. The data also showed energy moving directly from magnetic fields into the surrounding plasma during reconnection.\n\n\"We saw ribbon-like features moving extremely quickly down through the Sun's atmosphere, even before the main episode of the flare,\" says Pradeep. \"These streams of 'raining plasma blobs' are signatures of energy deposition, which get stronger and stronger as the flare progresses. Even after the flare subsides, the rain continues for some time. It's the first time we see this at this level of spatial and temporal detail in the solar corona.\n\nCooling After the Eruption\n\nAfter the most intense phase of the flare passed, EUI images showed the original cross shaped magnetic structure relaxing. At the same time, STIX and SPICE recorded cooling plasma and a drop in particle emissions toward normal levels. PHI observed the effects of the flare on the Sun's visible surface, completing a three dimensional view of the entire event.\n\n\"We didn't expect that the avalanche process could lead to such high energy particles,\" says Pradeep. \"We still have a lot to explore in this process, but that would need even higher resolution X-ray imagery from future missions to really disentangle.\"\n\nA New Understanding of Solar Explosions\n\n\"This is one of the most exciting results from Solar Orbiter so far,\" says Miho Janvier, ESA's Solar Orbiter co-Project Scientist. \"Solar Orbiter's observations unveil the central engine of a flare and emphasise the crucial role of an avalanche-like magnetic energy release mechanism at work. An interesting prospect is whether this mechanism happens in all flares, and on other flaring stars.\"\n\n\"These exciting observations, captured in incredible detail and almost moment by moment, allowed us to see how a sequence of small events cascaded into giant bursts of energy,\" says David Pontin of the University of Newcastle, Australia, who co-authored the paper.\n\nHe adds: \"By comparing the EUI observations with magnetic-field observations, we were able to disentangle the chain of events that led to the flare. What we observed challenges existing theories for flare energy release and, together with further observations, will allow us to refine those theories to improve our understanding.\"\n\nAbout the Solar Orbiter Mission\n\nSolar Orbiter is a joint mission between ESA and NASA and is operated by ESA. The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) is led by the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB). The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) is led by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS), Germany.

      "content": "Both sub-Neptunes and super-Earths may have begun with a hydrogen-rich envelope gravitationally captured from the surrounding stellar disk during accretion. Sub-Neptunes retained some portion of this primary atmosphere to the present day, whereas in the case of super-Earths, the envelope was subsequently lost7. The population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, and the origin of the radius valley that separates these two classes of planets, is best explained by cores that are made of an Earth-like composition without a substantial amount of accreted ice8,9,10,11. For sub-Neptunes, the hydrogen-rich envelope overlies the rocky core for billions of years, whereas for super-Earths, the envelope may be retained for about 100 Myr (refs. 2,8,12). During this time, the hydrogen envelope and the rocky core may have reacted chemically with each other, altering the composition of the atmosphere and interior. Our own Earth may have also once had a primary atmosphere that left its mark on the present-day composition of its interior13,14.\n\nThe structure and evolution of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths challenge our understanding of fundamental properties of materials at extreme conditions. For example6, at the core–envelope boundary of a typical sub-Neptune, the temperature may be 5,000 K, whereas the pressure may be 5 GPa. Both core and envelope are fluid at the conditions of the interface, which exceed the silicate melting temperature: the rocky core forms a magma ocean6,15,16. This part of the pressure–temperature space is not much explored by experiments or theory. Similar temperatures are found in the interiors of giant planets, but only at much higher pressures, at which dynamic compression experiments are able to probe17. By the same token, similar pressures are found in the interiors of rocky planets, but only at much lower temperature conditions that are readily accessible to static compression experiments18. Previous modelling studies have emphasized the importance of a better understanding of fluid silicate–hydrogen phase equilibria for super-Earth and sub-Neptune structure and evolution19. Experiments have demonstrated that small concentrations of hydrogen are soluble in silicate liquid, albeit at pressure–temperature conditions much less extreme than those we consider here18.\n\nWe use the phase coexistence method20,21 to study the reaction between hydrogen fluid and a liquid of MgSiO 3 composition, taken to be representative of the rocky portion of planets (Fig. 1 and Methods). The initial condition consists of equal-sized domains of pure hydrogen and pure silicate composition, pre-equilibrated to the same pressure and temperature. The Hellmann–Feynman forces are computed in density functional theory. As the molecular dynamics simulation proceeds, a reaction occurs, and a dynamic equilibrium is established. At temperatures below the critical temperature, two phases with distinct compositions coexist in equilibrium. By quantifying the compositions of the two coexisting phases, we map out the phase diagram and identify the critical temperature above which a single homogeneous fluid is stable. To gain additional insight into our results, we also perform a series of simulations of homogeneous fluids with compositions on the MgSiO 3 –H 2 join, from which we extract the energetics of solution. Further details are given in the Methods.\n\nFig. 1: Illustration of the phase coexistence method. a,b, Snapshots from a phase coexistence simulation at 10 GPa and 2,500 K: the initial condition (a) and from the equilibrated portion of the trajectory (b).

Full size image\n\nOver a range of conditions, we find two phases coexisting in dynamic equilibrium, one hydrogen-rich and the other hydrogen-poor (Fig. 1). In both phases, the silicate fraction nearly maintains MgSiO 3 stoichiometry, that is, MgSiO 3 behaves as a component, and the system is nearly binary. We choose as our compositional variable the molar fraction of the H 2 component\n\n$$x=\\frac{{N}_{{\\text{H}}_{2}}}{{N}_{{\\text{H}}_{2}}+{N}_{\\mathrm{MgO}}+{N}_{{\\text{SiO}}_{2}}}=\\frac{{N}_{\\text{H}}/2}{{N}_{\\text{H}}/2+2({N}_{\\text{Mg}}+{N}_{\\text{Si}}+{N}_{\\text{O}})/5}$$ (1)\n\nwhere N i is the number of molecules or atoms of type i. We quantify the composition of the two coexisting phases based on (1) one-dimensional density profiles using a Widom-like expression22 and (2) a three-dimensional coarse-grained density field23 (see Methods for further details).\n\nThe compositions of the two coexisting phases approach each other with increasing temperature (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Table 1) and merge into a single homogeneous phase at temperatures greater than the critical temperature T C . We find that the compositions of the two phases are asymmetric: the hydrogen-poor phase has a greater amount of hydrogen than the amount of silicate in the hydrogen-rich phase. An asymmetric regular solution model captures our results (see Methods for further details).\n\nFig. 2: Phase diagram and energetics of solution. a, Composition of the two coexisting phases from our simulations (symbols) near 2 GPa (red), 5 GPa (grey) and 10 GPa (blue) with uncertainties in composition indicated (Extended Data Table 1).

Two experimental measurements of the hydrogen solubility in mafic melt18 at 2 GPa (red squares with error bars) are also shown. b, Excess properties of solution at 5 GPa and 4,000 K from our homogeneous simulations: enthalpy (kJ mol−1) (solid line and black symbols), entropy (J mol−1 K−1) (long dashed line and dark grey symbols) and volume (cm3 mol−1) (short dashed line and light grey symbols). The total Gibbs free energy of solution (thin solid line) is also shown. Curves in a and b are computed from the same asymmetric regular solution model (Methods).

The excess entropy of solution far exceeds the ideal entropy of mixing (5.8 J mol−1 K−1), producing solvus curves (binodes) that are flat-topped: that is, the compositions of the two coexisting phases diverge rapidly from each other on cooling below T C . The negative volume of solution causes T C to decrease with increasing pressure: from 3,500 K at 2 GPa to 2,600 K at 10 GPa (Fig. 3).\n\nFig. 3: Phase diagram and core–envelope interface conditions. The equilibrated conditions of our simulations: black circles represent the conditions at which two phases coexist; white circles represent the conditions at which a single homogeneous phase is stable (uncertainties in pressure and temperature are smaller than the size of the symbols). The black line is the critical curve T C (P) and is computed from the same asymmetric regular solution model used to generate the curves in Fig. 2 (see Methods); the shading provides an estimate of the uncertainty in T C . The black dashed line is the MgSiO 3 liquidus59. Our results are compared with the conditions at the core–envelope interface in models of sub-Neptunes from the literature (red symbols and dashed lines): squares29 refer to rocky planets accreting by pebbles from 0.75M ⊕ to 2.5M ⊕ within a stellar disk at 1 au; down triangles15 represent Kepler-36c, outer core–envelope boundary at the beginning of the isolation stage (hotter) and at 7 Gyr; diamonds36 represent a sub-Neptune with M = 4M ⊕ at the end of the accretion stage (hotter) and at the end of the mass loss stage when the envelope mass M env /M = 0.025; red dashed line with no symbols30 represents rocky planets embedded in the disk and accreting by planetesimal impact from 0.1M ⊕ (colder) to 3.8M ⊕ ; up triangles16 denote a sub-Neptune with mass M = 4M ⊕ and hydrogen envelope mass M env /M = 0.02 on cooling from 1 Myr (hotter) to 10 Gyr in decade increments. The red solid line shows the conditions at the core–envelope interface in sub-Neptunes with M = 1–8M ⊕ , M env /M = 0.02, equilibrium temperature T eq = 500 K and intrinsic temperature T int = 70 K, with the crosses marking unit increments in M/M ⊕ , following existing methodology16,36. Full size image\n\nThe behaviour that we find was not anticipated by previous studies. Estimates of the solubility of hydrogen in silicate melt24,25,26,27 used an expression based on the solubility of noble gases (Henry’s law)28. This expression cannot capture complete miscibility because it assumes that hydrogen is inert. For example, one parameterization24 yields 20 mol% solubility of H 2 in silicate melt at 2 GPa, 4,000 K, and the other two studies yield smaller solubilities, as compared with the unlimited solubility (that is, miscibility) that we find. Estimates of the solubility of silicate in hydrogen fluid15,29,30,31,32 assumed that silicate solubility is limited by congruent silicate vaporization and ideal mixing, leading to underestimated solubility: for example, 0.2 mol% of silicate in hydrogen at 2 GPa, 4,000 K, as compared with the unlimited solubility that we find. A previous study19 argued that T C should be greater than or equal to the congruent vapour–liquid critical temperature T silicate , and that by analogy with the water–hydrogen system, T C might increase with increasing pressure. However, we find T C (3,500 K at 2 GPa) to be substantially less than T silicate (6,600 K at 0.14 GPa) (ref. 20) and T C decreasing with increasing pressure, illustrating the importance of fully non-ideal interactions as in our simulations. Complete miscibility in the fluid silicate–water system is well known33,34,35, and partly by analogy, a recent study speculated that miscibility might occur in the silicate–hydrogen system as well36. However, the silicate–water system is fundamentally different as reaction does not require redox exchange, unlike the silicate–hydrogen system.\n\nWe probe the microscopic mechanism of reaction between the two phases by examining the evolution of species during equilibration (Fig. 4). Initially, phase coexistence simulations have all H as H 2 , all O bonded to Si and Si surrounded by four O on average with no SiO. As the simulation proceeds (towards a homogeneous state in the example shown), H 2 diminishes at the expense of hydroxyl and molecular water species, and SiO and SiH n increase in abundance. These changes are captured by the redox reactions\n\n$${\\text{SiO}}_{2}+{\\text{H}}_{2}\\to \\text{SiO}+{\\text{H}}_{2}\\text{O}$$ (2)\n\n$${\\text{SiO}}_{2}+3{\\text{H}}_{2}\\to {\\text{SiH}}_{4}+2\\text{OH}$$ (3)\n\nproducing reduced Si species SiO and SiH 4 , while oxidizing H. We confirm the presence of O–H and Si–H bonding in our simulations by computing the radial distribution function37 over the equilibrated, homogeneous portion of the simulation, which shows clear peaks at short distance (<2 Å) in the O–H and Si–H radial distribution functions (Fig. 4). For illustration, we have written equation (3) in terms of SiH 4 , although in the simulation shown in Fig. 4 SiH 4 is subordinate to lower coordinate species SiH n (n < 4). However, we find that silane becomes more abundant than lower coordinate SiH n species at greater hydrogen concentration, for example, in the hydrogen-rich fluid in phase coexistence simulations performed at temperatures less than T C . Trace amounts of silane and water have been identified as reaction products in experiments in the MgSiO 3 –H 2 system, albeit at much lower temperatures than our simulations and without the ability to quantify abundances38. Apart from the redox reactions, the relative amounts of OH and H 2 O are governed by H 2 O + O → 2OH, where the O is bonded to Si (ref. 39).\n\nFig. 4: Speciation in the miscible fluid. Evolution of the speciation in a phase coexistence simulation at 5 GPa and 4,000 K that ultimately becomes homogeneous (inset) and the structure of the equilibrated homogeneous fluid (main figure). The main figure shows the H– and O– partial radial distribution functions and the inset shows the proportions of H atoms that are bound to one other H atom (H 2 ) (black), the proportion of O atoms that are bound to one (OH) or two H (H 2 O) atoms (red), and the proportion of Si atoms that are bound to a single O atom (SiO) (blue), or to any number of H atoms (SiH n ) (green). Full size image\n\nThe products of reactions (2) and (3) may be observable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). H 2 O has been observed in the atmosphere of sub-Neptunes at concentrations greater than stellar metallicity5,40,41,42. Determining whether the observed water enrichment is endogenous, that is, due to core–envelope reactions, such as equation (2), or from accreted ice from beyond the snow line43,44,45, is central to understanding the origin of these planets46. Some previous planetary modelling studies have proposed that water is produced primarily by reaction of hydrogen with FeO (ref. 26), but reaction of hydrogen with SiO 2 (equation (2)) may be a more important source of water27 because SiO 2 is expected to be much more abundant in rocky cores than FeO (ref. 47). Previous studies have assumed ideal mixing between species from the low pressures to which observations are most sensitive (10−6 GPa) all the way down to the core–envelope boundary (5 GPa) (refs. 26,27,48), and it will be important in future to include the strongly non-ideal effects that we find to evaluate whether some or all of the observed water enrichment is endogenous. Silicon species have not yet been identified in the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes, but the possibility of observing SiO with JWST has been evaluated in detail49, and silane has been observed in a brown dwarf with JWST50. Planetary modelling studies have examined whether core–envelope reactions such as equations (2) and (3) can produce silicon species at detectable levels high in the atmosphere27,32,51,52. Among the important considerations for future studies will be to include the non-ideal thermodynamics that we find and the incongruent saturation and condensation of silicon species.\n\nOur results indicate that the miscibility of core and envelope must be considered in models of the structure and thermal evolution of sub-Neptunes (Fig. 3). The reason is that probable pressure–temperature conditions at the core–envelope boundary lie well above the critical curve, in the regime of complete miscibility between silicate and hydrogen. For example, in a thermal evolution model of a sub-Neptune that assumes no reaction between core and envelope, the conditions at the core–envelope boundary lie above the critical curve throughout the first billion years of evolution (for example, 4.5 GPa, 3,600 K at 1 Gyr) (ref. 16). This model is, therefore, not in chemical equilibrium. Earlier states of evolution are likely to be even hotter and lie even farther above the critical curve. For example, the core–envelope boundary lies at 4 GPa and 13,000 K in a recent model at the end of the accretion phase36, and even hotter conditions are found during accretion15,30. Although the precise conditions at the core–envelope boundary depend on many factors, including the mass of the rocky core, how much gas the core accretes and how much it retains after disk dispersal, the pressure–temperature conditions that we have highlighted are typical of a wide variety of sub-Neptune models at various stages of evolution6,16. The only sub-Neptunes that do not exhibit H 2 –MgSiO 3 miscibility are less massive (<4M ⊕ ), older (≥10 Gyr) or with lower envelope mass fractions (<0.02) than most of the sub-Neptune population.\n\nOur results have important implications for every stage of the evolution of sub-Neptunes, from the accretion phase to boil off, to present-day observations of atmospheric chemistry. Consider first the accretion phase in which a sub-Neptune forms by accreting a rocky core while embedded in the disk6,53. The rocky core gravitationally captures a portion of the disk, forming a hydrogen-rich envelope. Previous analyses of this stage assume limited dissolution of hydrogen in the core, or silicate dissolution in the envelope dictated by the congruent vapour pressure of the silicate, while neglecting hydrogen solubility in the silicate15,24,25,29,30,36. Our results indicate that these are not good assumptions. If the planet maintains chemical equilibrium at the interface between the envelope and the core, then silicate and hydrogen are completely miscible over a wide range of plausible evolutionary scenarios (Fig. 3).\n\nAs the disk disperses, the planet loses mass by evaporation. If the envelope and core are chemically distinct, most of the envelope mass is lost during this phase: for example, in one scenario54 85% of the envelope is lost to boil off. However, if much of the hydrogen envelope is dissolved in the core, then a greater fraction of hydrogen may be retained by the planet after disk dispersal. A more in-depth analysis of this problem would consider the complete miscibility that we find, along with variations of the pressure–temperature conditions at the core–envelope interface that occur as a result of boil-off, and the attendant changes in the phase equilibria.\n\nAfter boil-off, the planet cools, altering the pressure and temperature conditions at the core–envelope interface. As the equilibrium between hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor phases evolves on cooling, partitioning of hydrogen between the core and envelope alters, leading to changes in the mass of the envelope and the planetary radius. Some sub-Neptunes may cross from earlier hotter states that are super-critical to later colder states that are sub-critical (Fig. 3), leading to changes in the composition of core and envelope that may involve silicate condensation, rain-out55, cloud formation or regions of convective inhibition19,56. Some sub-Neptunes may lose their envelopes because of photo-evaporation or core-powered mass loss, forming super-Earths8,9. The formation of super-Earths may also, therefore, be affected by silicate–hydrogen miscibility: if much of the hydrogen of sub-Neptunes is dissolved in the rocky core, the hydrogen may be less susceptible to loss24. Some super-Earths may have small low-molecular-weight atmospheres that originate in core–envelope reactions57, and even those that have completely lost their envelopes may still bear the imprint of chemical reaction between core and the envelope, including sequestration of hydrogen to a metallic core, and the production of endogenous water14,58.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Sub-Neptune and super-Earth planets have rocky cores surrounded by hydrogen-rich gas envelopes. Scientists have long studied these planets to understand how their cores and atmospheres interact, but the exact chemical mixing between the rocky core and hydrogen gas at extreme temperatures and pressures was unclear.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers used advanced computer simulations based on molecular physics to study how silicate rock (similar to Earth's core material) and hydrogen gas behave together under conditions found inside these planets. They discovered that, instead of staying separate, silicate and hydrogen can mix completely into a uniform fluid under a wide range of temperatures and pressures that are typical at the boundary between the core and envelope.\n\n**Impact** – This finding changes how scientists think about the structure and evolution of these planets. It means the core and atmosphere can chemically react and mix over billions of years, affecting the planet’s size, atmosphere composition, and how much hydrogen it keeps or loses. It also helps explain observations of water and other molecules in planet atmospheres, which may be created inside the planet rather than coming from outside sources.\n\n**What's next step** – Future planet models will include this core-envelope mixing to better predict planet sizes, atmospheres, and evolution. Observations from telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can test these ideas by looking for chemical signs of this mixing.

      "content": "Astronomers have long sought evidence to explain why comets at the outskirts of our own solar system contain crystalline silicates, since crystals require intense heat to form and these “dirty snowballs” spend most of their time in the ultracold Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. Now, looking outside our solar system, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has returned the first conclusive evidence that links how those conditions are possible. The telescope clearly showed for the first time that the hot, inner part of the disk of gas and dust surrounding a very young, actively forming star is where crystalline silicates are forged. Webb also revealed a strong outflow that is capable of carrying the crystals to the outer edges of this disk. Compared to our own fully formed, mostly dust-cleared solar system, the crystals would be forming approximately between the Sun and Earth.\n\nWebb’s sensitive mid-infrared observations of the protostar, cataloged EC 53, also show that the powerful winds from the star’s disk are likely catapulting these crystals into distant locales, like the incredibly cold edge of its protoplanetary disk where comets may eventually form.\n\n“EC 53’s layered outflows may lift up these newly formed crystalline silicates and transfer them outward, like they’re on a cosmic highway,” said Jeong-Eun Lee, the lead author of a new paper in Nature and a professor at Seoul National University in South Korea. “Webb not only showed us exactly which types of silicates are in the dust near the star, but also where they are both before and during a burst.”\n\nImage: Protostar EC 53 in the Serpens Nebula (NIRCam Image)\n\nNASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s 2024 NIRCam image shows protostar EC 53 circled. Researchers using new data from Webb’s MIRI proved that crystalline silicates form in the hottest part of the disk of gas and dust surrounding the star — and may be shot to the system’s edges. Image: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Klaus Pontoppidan (NASA-JPL), Joel Green (STScI); Image Processing: Alyssa Pagan (STScI)\n\nThe team used Webb’s MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) to collect two sets of highly detailed spectra to identify specific elements and molecules, and determine their structures. Next, they precisely mapped where everything is, both when EC 53 is “quiet” (but still gradually “nibbling” at its disk) and when it’s more active (what’s known as an outburst phase).\n\nThis star, which has been studied by this team and others for decades, is highly predictable. (Other young stars have erratic outbursts, or their outbursts last for hundreds of years.) About every 18 months, EC 53 begins a 100-day, bombastic burst phase, kicking up the pace and absolutely devouring nearby gas and dust, while ejecting some of its intake as powerful jets and outflows. These expulsions may fling some of the newly formed crystals into the outskirts of the star’s protoplanetary disk.\n\n“Even as a scientist, it is amazing to me that we can find specific silicates in space, including forsterite and enstatite near EC 53,” said Doug Johnstone, a co-author and a principal research officer at the National Research Council of Canada. “These are common minerals on Earth. The main ingredient of our planet is silicate.” For decades, research has also identified crystalline silicates not only on comets in our solar system, but also in distant protoplanetary disks around other, slightly older stars — but couldn’t pinpoint how they got there. With Webb’s new data, researchers now better understand how these conditions might be possible.\n\n“It’s incredibly impressive that Webb can not only show us so much, but also where everything is,” said Joel Green, a co-author and an instrument scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. “Our research team mapped how the crystals move throughout the system. We’ve effectively shown how the star creates and distributes these superfine particles, which are each significantly smaller than a grain of sand.”\n\nWebb’s MIRI data also clearly shows the star’s narrow, high-velocity jets of hot gas near its poles, and the slightly cooler and slower outflows that stem from the innermost and hottest area of the disk that feeds the star. The image above, which was taken by another Webb instrument, NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), shows one set of winds and scattered light from EC 53’s disk as a white semi-circle angled toward the right. Its winds also flow in the opposite direction, roughly behind the star, but in near-infrared light, this region appears dark. Its jets are too tiny to pick out.\n\nImage: Silicate Crystallization and Movement Near Protostar EC 53 (Illustration)\n\nThis illustration represents half the disk of gas and dust surrounding the protostar EC 53. Stellar outbursts periodically form crystalline silicates, which are launched up and out to the edges of the system, where comets and other icy rocky bodies may eventually form. Illustration: NASA, ESA, CSA, Elizabeth Wheatley (STScI)\n\nLook ahead\n\nEC 53 is still “wrapped” in dust and may be for another 100,000 years. Over millions of years, while a young star’s disk is heavily populated with teeny grains of dust and pebbles, an untold number of collisions will occur that may slowly build up a range of larger rocks, eventually leading to the formation of terrestrial and gas giant planets. As the disk settles, both the star itself and any rocky planets will finish forming, the dust will largely clear (no longer obscuring the view), and a Sun-like star will remain at the center of a cleared planetary system, with crystalline silicates “littered” throughout.\n\nEC 53 is part of the Serpens Nebula, which lies 1,300 light-years from Earth and is brimming with actively forming stars.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is the world’s premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it.
