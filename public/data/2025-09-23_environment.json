      "content": "How can you tell which products are really good for the environment? It’s easy to know that wasting water is bad. But what about the harder questions? Is buying a new washing machine better than keeping your old one, which uses a lot of water? When does a hybrid car’s better gas mileage make up for the pollution from making it? How do companies even know what their products do to the environment?\n\nThe answers can be found in Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) reports that many companies now offer to back up their product and packaging sustainability claims. And the good news is that you can use these reports to make better buying choices.\n\nWhat Is Life Cycle Analysis?\n\nAn LCA is a way to learn how products affect the environment before, during, and after you use them. These reports look at everything from the extraction of the raw materials to throwing the product away. Often, the various impacts of an LCA are converted into carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq) for ease of comparison.\n\nThe International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) describes the four main components of an LCA: 1.) the goal and scope definition, 2.) an inventory analysis, 3.) an impact assessment, and 4.) interpretation. These standardized phases ensure that LCAs provide reliable, comparable data that consumers can trust when making purchasing decisions.\n\nAn LCA counts all the energy and materials used to make, ship, use, and get rid of a product. It also tracks all the pollution and waste created at each step. Because climate change is such a significant problem, many LCAs focus on a product’s carbon footprint, or the amount of greenhouse gas pollution it creates.\n\nLCAs Are Growing Fast\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, approximately 17,000 EPDs had been published globally, which represents massive growth in recent years. Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) are summary reports based on LCAs that are easier to read and compare. The enormous growth in LCA and EPD availability shows that more companies are concerned about and studying their products’ environmental impact than ever before.\n\nA 2025 study by One Click LCA reveals progress in reducing embodied carbon in construction by 10% to 30% due to the use of LCAs. Over 60% of AEC respondents report at least a 10% embodied carbon reduction using LCA, with a third achieving up to 20% improvements. LCAs play a crucial role in helping companies develop cleaner products.\n\nMost companies that are willing to take on the expensive and time-consuming process of conducting LCAs do so to gain vital knowledge to improve their processes.\n\nHow You Can Use Your Buying Power\n\nWhen people care about the environment, companies listen. According to a 2022 report from First Insight and the Baker Retailing Center at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, 68% of consumers who responded to a survey indicated a willingness to pay more for sustainable products. More than 81% of consumers feel that companies should help improve the environment, but translating this sentiment into purchasing behavior requires access to credible environmental data.\n\nYou can use the power of your wallet by asking for and using LCA information before you buy things.\n\nWhere to Find Environmental Reports\n\nEnvironmental Product Declarations (EPDs): These are the best reports for regular people to use. They’re based on LCAs but written in a way that’s easier to understand.\n\nMajor EPD databases where you can search for products include:\n\nInternational EPD System : The global programme for Environmental Product Declarations, operated by EPD International AB\n\nUL SPOT : Specializes in building materials and consumer goods\n\nEPD North America : Find third-party verified Environmental Product Declarations\n\nDirect from Manufacturers: Many companies now publish LCA summaries or full EPDs on their websites. Construction materials, electronics, and automotive companies are leading the charge. Examples include:\n\nIndustry Associations: Trade groups often commission industry-wide LCAs that provide baseline environmental performance data for entire product categories. For example, nine industry associations recently commissioned an LCA study on cement co-processing that found up to 1 ton of CO2 savings per ton of composite waste. The National Ready Mixed Concrete Association provides LCA reports for concrete products, and the Aluminum Association has developed comprehensive automotive LCA guidelines to ensure accurate comparisons between materials.\n\nHow to Ask for Environmental Information\n\nWhen you can’t find LCA information easily, you can ask for it:\n\nFor Big Purchases: When buying appliances, cars, or home systems, ask: “Do you have an Environmental Product Declaration for this product?” This simple question shows companies that people want to know about environmental impact.\n\nFor Business Buying: If you buy things for work, ask suppliers to provide EPDs or similar environmental reports. Over 80% of all respondents to a OneClick LCA survey said that environmental product declarations (EPDs) influence their material purchasing decisions in building projects.\n\nFor Building Materials: 83% of construction professionals say they rely on EPDs to select low-carbon materials for building projects. Asking for EPDs from building supply stores is now the new normal.\n\nUnderstanding What’s Included in LCAs\n\nNot all LCAs look at the same things, and knowing the differences helps you make better choices.\n\nCradle-to-gate means the study only looks at making the product, stopping at distribution, and excluding the impact of product use after purchase. Unfortunately, it can also be a sneaky way to distract from a product’s actual impact, for example, by highlighting the sustainable production of a product that creates a lot of pollution during its useful life. This is a greenwashing strategy known as the “Lesser of Two Evils.” Fortunately, this misuse of life cycle analysis is rare.\n\nCradle-to-grave looks at the whole life of the product from resource extraction to manufacturing, usage, and maintenance, all the way through to its disposal phase. Cradle-to-cradle includes recycling the product into something new.\n\nUnderstanding these differences helps you ask good questions: “Does this report include the impact of using the product?” “What did the report assume about how long the product lasts?” “Does it include what happens when you throw it away?“\n\nHow to Read Environmental Reports\n\nLearning to read these reports takes practice, but you can start with the essential parts.\n\nSummary and Biggest Problems: Most reports begin by outlining the product’s most significant environmental impacts. For example, a 38-page EPD for a Brilla pasta product contains sections on the brand and product, environmental performance calculations, information on sustainable wheat cultivation, milling, packaging production, pasta production, distribution, cooking, packaging end-of-life, and summary tables for environmental impact in different markets.\n\nTypes of Environmental Impact: Reports usually measure several steps in the production, transportation, use, and disposal or recycling steps in a product’s life:\n\nCarbon footprint (greenhouse gases)\n\nWater use\n\nEnergy use\n\nAir and water pollution\n\nWaste creation\n\nUnderstanding what the study included helps you know if it’s complete. Some companies might only study the “clean“ parts of making their product while leaving out the dirty parts.\n\nLearning from Examples\n\nBegin by reviewing reports for products you are familiar with. Construction materials often come with good, detailed reports that show how the LCA works. You can also look at reports for electronics, food, and other everyday products.\n\nLook for reports that:\n\nAre checked by independent experts\n\nLook at the whole life of the product\n\nUse recent information, no older than five years\n\nClearly explain the most significant environmental impacts\n\nUnderstanding Limits and Comparisons\n\nYou can’t always compare reports from different companies directly because they might use different criteria or make different assumptions that underlie the analysis. However, these reports are still useful; you need to read them carefully.\n\nFor example, studies of cloth vs. disposable diapers give different answers depending on how much water they assume is used for washing cloth diapers and how they presume disposable ones are handled after use. Studies of coffee show that how you make your coffee matters as much as which coffee you buy. And while every study of beef gives a different number for the carbon footprint of a product, they all agree that beef and lamb create more CO2 than almost any other food.\n\nSupporting Honest Companies\n\nWhen you buy from companies that share detailed environmental information, you’re telling the market that honesty matters. Your spending can encourage more companies to study their environmental impact and work to reduce it. Share what you learn from environmental reports with friends and family. Support policies that require companies to share environmental information. Ask for better environmental labeling on products.\n\nEnvironmental reports often don’t provide simple yes-or-no answers about products. But they help you understand environmental impacts and find ways to make better choices. When shoppers actively look for and use LCA information, they encourage companies to:\n\nDo more complete environmental studies\n\nFind and reduce their environmental impact\n\nInvest in cleaner ways to make things\n\nDesign products that can be recycled or reused\n\nLife cycle analysis is the best way we have to understand environmental impacts. But it only works when people like you actively look for and use this information.\n\nEditor’s Note: Originally published on September 23, 2021, this article was substantially updated and revised based on new LCA developments in September 2025.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many products claim to be good for the environment, but it can be hard to know which ones really are. Sometimes, deciding if a new product is better than an old one, or if a hybrid car is worth its pollution cost, isn’t simple. That’s where Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) comes in.\n\n**What happened** – Life Cycle Analysis looks at a product’s environmental impact from start to finish—starting with raw materials, through manufacturing, shipping, usage, and finally disposal. Companies use LCAs to create Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), which summarize this information clearly. In recent years, thousands of EPDs have been published worldwide, showing more businesses are studying and sharing their products’ environmental effects. For example, LCAs helped reduce carbon emissions in building materials by 10% to 30% in some cases.\n\n**Impact** – This information helps shoppers make smarter choices by comparing products based on real data, not just marketing claims. Many consumers say they’re willing to pay more for sustainable products if they have trustworthy information. LCAs also push companies to improve their products by reducing pollution and waste, and designing items that can be recycled or reused.\n\n**What's next step** – You can use LCAs and EPDs when shopping by asking companies for these reports, especially when buying big items like appliances or cars. Construction professionals increasingly rely on EPDs to choose low-carbon materials. As more people demand this information, more companies will conduct LCAs and share honest environmental data, leading to cleaner products.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Life Cycle Analysis and Environmental Product Declarations give clear, trustworthy insights into a product’s environmental impact, helping consumers and companies make better, more sustainable choices.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Beaucoup de produits prétendent être bons pour l’environnement, mais il est difficile de savoir lesquels le sont vraiment. Parfois, il n’est pas simple de décider si un produit neuf est meilleur qu’un ancien, ou si une voiture hybride justifie la pollution causée pour sa fabrication. C’est là que l’analyse du cycle de vie (ACV) intervient.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – L’analyse du cycle de vie étudie l’impact environnemental d’un produit du début à la fin, depuis les matières premières, la fabrication, le transport, l’utilisation, jusqu’à l’élimination. Les entreprises utilisent l’ACV pour créer des Déclarations Environnementales de Produit (DEP), qui résument ces informations de façon claire. Ces dernières années, des milliers de DEP ont été publiées dans le monde, montrant que de plus en plus d’entreprises étudient et partagent l’impact environnemental de leurs produits. Par exemple, l’ACV a aidé à réduire les émissions de carbone dans les matériaux de construction de 10 % à 30 %.\n\n**Impact** – Ces informations aident les consommateurs à faire des choix plus éclairés en comparant les produits avec des données réelles, et non seulement des arguments commerciaux. Beaucoup de consommateurs sont prêts à payer plus pour des produits durables s’ils disposent d’informations fiables. L’ACV pousse aussi les entreprises à améliorer leurs produits en réduisant la pollution et les déchets, et en concevant des articles recyclables ou réutilisables.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Vous pouvez utiliser les ACV et DEP lors de vos achats en demandant ces rapports aux entreprises, surtout pour les gros achats comme les appareils électroménagers ou les voitures. Les professionnels du bâtiment s’appuient de plus en plus sur les DEP pour choisir des matériaux à faible émission de carbone. Plus les gens demanderont ces informations, plus les entreprises réaliseront d’ACV et partageront des données environnementales honnêtes, ce qui mènera à des produits plus propres.\n\n**Phrase clé** – L’analyse du cycle de vie et les déclarations environnementales de produit offrent des informations claires et fiables sur l’impact environnemental d’un produit, aidant consommateurs et entreprises à faire des choix durables et responsables.",

A veces, decidir si un producto nuevo es mejor que uno viejo, o si un coche híbrido vale la contaminación que genera su fabricación, no es simple. Ahí es donde entra el análisis del ciclo de vida (ACV).\n\n**Qué pasó** – El análisis del ciclo de vida examina el impacto ambiental de un producto desde el principio hasta el final: desde las materias primas, fabricación, transporte, uso, hasta su desecho. Las empresas usan estos análisis para crear Declaraciones Ambientales de Producto (DAP), que resumen esta información de forma clara. En los últimos años, miles de DAP se han publicado en todo el mundo, mostrando que más empresas estudian y comparten el impacto ambiental de sus productos. Por ejemplo, los ACV ayudaron a reducir las emisiones de carbono en materiales de construcción entre un 10 % y un 30 %.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta información ayuda a los compradores a tomar decisiones más inteligentes comparando productos con datos reales, no solo con publicidad. Muchos consumidores están dispuestos a pagar más por productos sostenibles si tienen información confiable.

Climate change is reshaping where crops can grow, trade disputes threaten supply chains, and smallholder farmers who produce much of our food often have the least power in the system. Meet Heather Terry, founder and CEO of GoodSAM Foods, and discover how the company is transforming the traditional smallhold farm model by putting people and regenerative agriculture at the heart of a growing food company. GoodSAM Foods sources 90% of its ingredients directly from smallholder farms in Latin America and Africa, eliminating middlemen and reinvesting profits into farming communities. Terry’s approach is both principled and pragmatic: as climate volatility reduces crop yields globally, the companies that have built genuine relationships with farmers will have access to limited harvests. “When I’m a farmer and I suddenly have leverage, who am I going to sell that product to?” Terry asks. “It’s relationships.”\n\nTerry’s journey to raise $9 million in Series A funding over 18 months illustrates the disconnect between traditional investors and regenerative business models. After facing skepticism from conventional CPG investors, she found success with impact investors who understood that sustainable food systems represent the future of the industry. While GoodSAM maintains USDA Organic and Non-GMO Project verification, Terry takes a critical stance on regenerative certification labels, arguing that current systems impose Global North standards on farmers who have practiced regenerative techniques for generations. Instead, GoodSAM focuses on direct relationships and on-ground verification. Her proactive approach protected both the company and its farming partners from sudden economic shocks at a time when the U.S. food system faces mounting pressures from climate impacts and trade policy changes. “Every time you pick something up off the shelf, you are voting,” Terry said. “You’re sending a signal to a company.”\n\nYou can learn more about GoodSAM Foods at goodsamfoods.com.\n\nSubscribe to Sustainability In Your Ear on iTunes\n\nFollow Sustainability In Your Ear on Spreaker, iHeartRadio, or YouTube",

      "summary": "The climate crisis is causing increased extreme weather events in Southeast Asia. Could “sponge cities,” a city planning method engineered by Chinese architect, Yu Kongjian, help them weather the storm?",
      "content": "This article was submitted as part of the Global Voices Climate Justice fellowship, which pairs journalists from Sinophone and Global Majority countries to investigate the effects of Chinese development projects abroad. Find more stories here.\n\nIn March 2025, torrential rains inundated the streets of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. The heavy rainfall caused severe deluge in the city and its nearby areas, killing at least nine people and displacing 90,000. It also reminded residents of painful memories from 2020, when intense flooding in the metropolitan city killed at least 60 people.\n\nSocial media was soon flooded with videos of the disaster, the ensuing evacuation missions, and first responders’ mitigation efforts. One such video shows emergency personnel rescuing people in boats and trying to clear flooded roads by shooting the excess water into the river with firetrucks.\n\n@tawabb_ Inalillahi, turut berduka atas musibah Hari ini, Selasa 4 Maret 2025 Banjir di sejumlah Wilayah Jabodetabek .. 📍Kali Ciliwung, Jatinegara, Jakarta Timur ♬ suara asli – Tawabb – tawabb_\n\nInalillahi, turut berduka atas musibah Hari ini, Selasa 4 Maret 2025 Banjir di sejumlah Wilayah Jabodetabek .. 📍Kali Ciliwung, Jatinegara, Jakarta Timur\n\nTo Allah we belong and to Him we return, condolences for the disaster today, Tuesday, March 4, 2025 Floods in a number of areas of Jabodetabek .. 📍Ciliwung River, Jatinegara, East Jakarta\n\nOther major cities in Southeast Asia have also been devastated by severe floods caused by extreme weather.\n\nParts of metropolitan Manila, the capital of the Philippines, experienced flooding from phenomenal rainfall at unprecedented intensity this August. According to expert analysis, the downpour in the city was equivalent to about five days of rain, dumped in just one hour. In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, after heavy thunderstorms this September, streets were submerged by over a meter of water, triggering widespread traffic gridlock. Residents had to abandon their vehicles and wade through flooded roads during rush hour.\n\nExtreme weather events linked to climate change are occurring at a higher frequency and intensity in Southeast Asia. This exacerbates urban flooding, a chronic problem in many sprawling megacities in the region due to outdated urban planning, low-lying coastal positions, and oversaturated land.\n\nUrban flooding is also common in China, as 641 of the country's 654 largest cities are affected by regular flooding, especially megacities on its eastern and southern coast.\n\nIn order to resolve the problem of urban flooding, China incorporated the concept of “sponge cities” (海绵城市) into its national policy in 2013, and pilot projects featuring this concept have subsequently launched in scores of cities across the country.\n\nWhat is a sponge city?\n\nOne of China's most prominent urban architects, Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), proposed the sponge city method for managing floods.\n\nYu uses a sponge as a metaphor for cities’ rainwater storage capacity. While conventional flood water management focuses on draining water away as quickly as possible through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities emphasize the opposite — absorbing water and slowly releasing it, like a sponge.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explains. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nAs cities expand, natural ground is replaced by impermeable surfaces, such as concrete and asphalt, that prevent water from being absorbed. Yu believes that the destruction of many natural water systems, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands, due to rapid urbanization, is one of the key reasons why flooding disasters occur so frequently in Chinese megacities today. The sponge city model focuses on restoring natural water systems, enabling the land to absorb rainwater, thereby mitigating flooding disasters and reusing the rainwater locally. In an interview with the Chinese state-funded People's Daily, Yu explained his belief that overreliance on “grey” infrastructure (such as concrete dams and pipelines) can be limiting:\n\n工业化大家相信人类的技术、人类的机械工程、钢筋水泥工程能够征服自然。因为它有科学的模型，它能计算出水流，能计算出运动的轨迹，能计算出河道。越直、越硬、越光，它的过水越快，它的防洪效果越好。就是这种工程机械的，这种机械的工程思维，就是单一目标的思考。\n\nIndustrialization has fostered a belief that human technology, mechanical engineering, and reinforced concrete can conquer nature. Because it has scientific models, it can calculate water flow, calculate movement trajectories, calculate river channels. The straighter, harder, and smoother, the faster the water passes, the better the flood control effect. This is the kind of engineering machinery, this kind of mechanical engineering thinking, that is, single-minded thinking.\n\nIn 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced his support for sponge cities and made them a top priority for the future.\n\n解决城市缺水问题，必须顺应自然。比如，在提升城市排水系统时要优先考虑把有限的雨水留下来，优先考虑更多利用自然力量排水，建设自然积存、自然渗透、自然净化的'海绵城市'。\n\nTo solve the problem of urban water shortages, we must adapt to nature. For example, when improving urban drainage systems, we should prioritize keeping limited rainwater, prioritize using more natural forces for drainage, and build ‘sponge cities’ with natural accumulation, natural infiltration, and natural purification.\n\nSome of the strategies employed to create these so-called sponge cities include green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\nResearchers have found that the sponge city projects in China have significantly improved stormwater runoff control and helped reform unfavorable geographical environments.\n\nAdaptation in Southeast Asia\n\nYu believes that his water management concept will be effective in flood-vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia, while some other countries including Singapore, the US and Russia are already benefiting from the implementation of similar concepts.\n\nIn an interview with the Chinese media Sanlian Lifeweek, Yu points out that China and Southeast Asia share the same challenges brought by monsoon climates.\n\n在季风性气候下，降雨严重不均，一天可能有200毫米的雨降下来，再大的地下蓄水空间，再粗的排水管道和强大的排水泵站，都没办法解决瞬时的排洪排涝问题……最有效的解决方法就是基于自然、适应于自然、借助于自然来解决问题。\n\nUnder a monsoon climate, rainfall is extremely uneven. In a single day, as much as 200 millimeters of rain may fall, and no matter how large the underground water storage space, how wide the drainage pipes, or how powerful the pumping stations, the problem of discharging floodwaters instantaneously cannot be solved….the most effective solution is to address problems by being based on nature, adapted to nature, and making use of nature.\n\nConventional water management approaches, which mainly focus on channeling rainwater out of the city, are unsuitable for cities with monsoon climates, Yu states.\n\n“These cities fail because they have been colonised by Western culture and copied their infrastructure and urban model,” he says in an interview with the BBC.\n\nYu and his team have applied the sponge city concept in the bustling urban heart of Bangkok, where they transformed the site of a former tobacco factory into Benjakitti Forest Park. The park reduces the destructive force of stormwater, filters contaminated water and provides a wildlife habitat as well as a public recreational space to residents, according to a press release by Turenspace, an urban design company founded by Yu.\n\nThe project demonstrated success in the summer of 2022, when Bangkok experienced a 10-year rainfall event. Much of the city was flooded, while the park and its vicinity were not.\n\nControversies and challenges\n\nAt the same time, sponge cities have faced controversies and skepticism. Though the concept has been piloted in many Chinese cities, it is mostly implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas. As a result, its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nIn a previous interview, Yu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities is challenging, as it demands cross-departmental collaboration, requiring strong political will and extensive administrative coordination.\n\nSome critics also point out that the sponge city design often can’t fully cope with the unprecedented levels of rainfall brought on by the climate crisis. In 2021, when heavy rainfall hit Henan province in China, floods killed 292 people in its capital city, Zhengzhou, which is a major pioneer of the sponge city concept. Many questioned the effectiveness of the sponge city infrastructure after the fatal disaster.\n\nWorse still, under climate change, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe. Some critics argue that design standards are not always fully updated to withstand intensifying precipitation trends under climate change.\n\nHu Gang, a Chinese urban planning expert explains that the sponge city model can only function during moderate or light rainfall, but not during a recording-breaking rainstorm. To alleviate urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall, Hu says that in addition to continuously building sponge city infracture, establishing a more comprehensive drainage system, emergency shelter and disaster preparedness plans are also key solutions.\n\nFrom the perspective of Southeast Asia, there are obstacles to implementing the sponge city concept. For example, for flood-prone Jakarta, the high cost of developing sponge city infrastructure is often cited as one of the biggest challenges. Other obstacles include an aging drainage system and a lack of space for new construction or redevelopment in the overcrowded capital.\n\nIn 2022, Indonesian officials announced that to absorb rainfall and minimize flood damage, the sponge city concept would be implemented in Indonesia's upcoming capital city, Nusantara, which is currently being constructed in East Kalimantan and will replace Jakarta upon completion. The city is being built from the ground up, and officials are claiming it will be the “world's most sustainable city.” The project is one of the first instances of a country moving its capital due to climate pressures, and has not unfolded without controversy.\n\nNusantara will incorporate large open spaces connected to its hydrological system to retain and store rainwater, according to the report. The new capital city will also feature porous road surfaces and green rooftops to reduce direct runoff. However, the construction of the new capital city is currently shadowed by budget cuts, and concerns grow that the development of Nusantara will not be completed anytime soon.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Southeast Asia has been facing more severe floods because of climate change. Cities like Jakarta, Manila, and Ho Chi Minh City have suffered from heavy rains that cause dangerous flooding and disrupt daily life.\n\n**What happened** – A Chinese architect named Yu Kongjian created the idea of \"sponge cities\" to help control flooding. Instead of quickly sending rainwater away with pipes, sponge cities soak up water like a sponge, using natural spaces such as parks, wetlands, and special pavements to absorb and slowly release rainwater. This idea is being tested in China and even applied in parts of Southeast Asia, like a park in Bangkok that helped protect the city from flooding during a big storm.\n\n**Impact** – Sponge cities offer a new way to handle floods by working with nature instead of fighting it. This method can reduce flood damage and help cities use rainwater better. It is especially useful in places with heavy, sudden rainfalls, like those caused by monsoon seasons in Southeast Asia. Indonesia is planning to build its new capital city, Nusantara, using sponge city designs to make it more flood-resistant and sustainable.\n\n**What's next step** – While sponge cities show promise, they face challenges like high costs and the need for cooperation between government departments. Indonesia’s new capital project will test how well these ideas can work on a large scale. Scientists and planners will continue improving designs to handle even stronger storms caused by climate change.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Sponge cities use nature-based designs to help Southeast Asian cities better manage floods and prepare for future climate challenges.\n\n",

      "summary": "Researchers found that ice can trigger stronger chemical reactions than liquid water, dissolving iron minerals in extreme cold. Freeze-thaw cycles amplify the effect, releasing iron into rivers and soils. With climate change accelerating these cycles, Arctic waterways may face major transformations.",
      "content": "Ice can dissolve iron minerals more effectively than liquid water, according to a new study from Umeå University. The discovery could help explain why many Arctic rivers are now turning rusty orange as permafrost thaws in a warming climate.\n\nThe study, recently published in the scientific journal PNAS, shows that ice at minus ten degrees Celsius releases more iron from common minerals than liquid water at four degrees Celsius. This challenges the long-held belief that frozen environments slow down chemical reactions.\n\n\"It may sound counterintuitive, but ice is not a passive frozen block,\" says Jean-François Boily, Professor at Umeå University and co-author of the study. \"Freezing creates microscopic pockets of liquid water between ice crystals. These act like chemical reactors, where compounds become concentrated and extremely acidic. This means they can react with iron minerals even at temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius.\"\n\nTo understand the process, the researchers studied goethite - a widespread iron oxide mineral - together with a naturally occurring organic acid, using advanced microscopy and experiments.\n\nThey discovered that repeated freeze-thaw cycles make iron dissolve more efficiently. As the ice freezes and thaws, organic compounds that were previously trapped in the ice are released, fuelling further chemical reactions. Salinity also plays a crucial role: fresh and brackish water increase dissolution, while seawater can suppress it.\n\nThe findings apply mainly to acidic environments, such as mine drainage sites, frozen dust in the atmosphere, acid sulfate soils along the Baltic Sea coast, or in any acidic frozen environment where iron minerals interact with organics. The next step is to find out if the same is true for all iron-bearing ice. This is what ongoing research in the Boily laboratory will soon reveal.\n\n\"As the climate warms, freeze-thaw cycles become more frequent,\" says Angelo Pio Sebaaly, doctoral student and first author of the study. \"Each cycle releases iron from soils and permafrost into the water. This can affect water quality and aquatic ecosystems across vast areas.\"\n\nThe findings show that ice is not a passive storage medium, but an active player. As freezing and thawing increase in polar and mountain regions, for the impact on ecosystems. and the natural cycling of elements could be significant.",
