      "title": "From silence to strength: Women leaders speak out in South Sudan",
      "summary": "Scolded for wanting to go to school as a girl and dismissed or ignored as an adult, Awrelia from Wau in South Sudan has learnt to advocate for herself, her children and for the women in her community.",
      "content": "She knows what it’s like to be silenced.\n\nBorn into a family that didn’t believe in educating girls, she had to stay home while her brothers went to school. Only when she moved to Khartoum with her uncle did she get a chance to study, though not for long.\n\n“I was forced into marriage at 14,” Awrelia said. “Even before then, some relatives scolded me just for going to school. I fought to finish primary school, but I couldn’t go any further.”\n\nEven so, she never gave up on the value of education – especially for her daughters. “I hope they grow up to be responsible and successful women leaders. Something has to change for girls.”\n\n© IOM/Amber Christino Awrelia at home in Wau.\n\nWidowed mother of eight\n\nIn South Sudan, where conflict and deeply entrenched gender norms have shaped life for generations, change comes slowly – yet women like Awrelia are leading it with courage and determination.\n\nA widowed mother of eight, she has spent years raising her children alone, often under difficult and uncertain conditions.\n\n“Their father died when they were very young. My eldest was still in primary school,” Awrelia recounts. “I’ve been raising them alone ever since.”\n\nIn her daily life, Awrelia constantly navigates complex family dynamics, scarcity, and stigma, but she keeps going. “People expect us to endure silently. Even when women try to seek help, no one responds.”\n\nIn public spaces, the challenges are even greater. Speaking ahead of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women marked annually on 25 November, Awrelia described how women are often dismissed or ignored. “They say we’re just women, as if our voices don’t matter,” she said. “I kept quiet for years because I was afraid to speak up.”\n\n© IOM/Geoffrey Sauke Nearly 1,400 women across South Sudan have benefitted from leadership training.\n\nTransformative training\n\nBut even before she spoke out, Awrelia was leading in her own way – fighting for her children’s education and holding her family together. That strength deepened when she joined a women’s leadership training organized by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Wau.\n\nThe training is included in IOM’s gender-transformative recovery programme – part of a broader, locally led effort to strengthen women’s leadership and ensure their participation in community decisions.\n\nAcross South Sudan, women’s groups and grassroots movements have long been laying the groundwork for change. The five-day course builds on that momentum, offering women a safe space to reflect, learn, and grow together.\n\nI learned that being a leader means treating others fairly and solving problems with patience. The training gave me courage to stand up for myself. Now I know I can lead.\n\n“I learned that being a leader means treating others fairly and solving problems with patience,” she said. “The training gave me courage to stand up for myself. Now I know I can lead.”\n\nBack in her community, she put her new confidence into action. Her local women’s group had nearly collapsed, but she brought it back together. Now they meet regularly to support one another and share their challenges.\n\nThough they lack funding for income-generating activities like sewing or catering, the group offers something equally powerful: solidarity.\n\nWomen run households\n\nIn many displacement-affected areas of South Sudan, women head up to 80 per cent of households.\n\nIn Wau, Bentiu, Malakal, and other areas where IOM runs the programme, more women are stepping forward. Those who once stayed silent now speak up at meetings, support survivors of violence, and build networks to share experiences and grow together.\n\nAwrelia has noticed a change in how she is perceived. “People recognize me now,” she said. “During a meeting with chiefs and women leaders, they mentioned my name and honoured me in front of everyone. It made me feel proud. The women I lead respect me, and I respect them.”\n\nFrom homes to community halls, women like Awrelia are finding their voices and reshaping what the future can look like – for their daughters, their families, and their country.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In South Sudan, many girls and women face strong traditions that limit their opportunities, especially in education and leadership. Years of conflict have made life harder, and many women have to raise families alone.\n\n**What happened** – Awrelia, a woman from Wau, South Sudan, was not allowed to go to school as a child and was forced into marriage at 14.

Women like Awrelia are now speaking up in community meetings, supporting each other, and helping survivors of violence. Their leadership is changing how people see women and is building stronger communities where women’s voices matter.\n\n**What's next step** – The women’s groups hope to start small businesses like sewing or catering to support themselves financially, though they currently lack funds. The program plans to continue training more women, helping them grow as leaders and create positive change in their communities.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Leadership training is helping women in South Sudan overcome barriers to speak out, support each other, and lead their communities toward a better future.",

      "title": "‘Leave no one behind’: As wealth gap widens, UN calls for new industrial deal for world’s poorest",
      "summary": "Ministers and leaders from across the world’s 44 least developed countries have pledged to accelerate industrialisation that benefits all, and strengthen resilience in the face of global challenges, at an international UN conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ",
      "content": "Arriving from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, the ministers have one thing in common: they each represent one of the poorest, most vulnerable nations in the world, officially designated by the UN as least developed countries (LDCs).\n\nThe fighting seems a world away from the vast King Abdul Aziz Conference Centre in the Saudi capital, where government ministers assembled on Saturday for a family photo to mark the occasion of the Eleventh Ministerial Meeting of Least Developed Countries .\n\nFirst, we need to end the war. Then, we have to restart the factories.\n\nLike many of the world’s poorest countries, Sudan’s attempts to develop its economy have been severely hampered by conflict. Yet, even in the midst of a brutal civil war, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) continues to offer economic development support and a path to recovery.\n\n“First, we need to end the war. Then, we have to restart the factories,” says Basher Abdullah, advisor to Sudan’s Minister of Industry and Trade.\n\n‘Yes to global solidarity’\n\n“We need a decisive change of direction,” declared Gerd Müller, the Director-General of UNIDO, in his opening remarks to the assembled ministers, reminding them that industrialization is “essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (the 17 global goals adopted by all UN Member States in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development).and building resilience against crises.\n\n“We need to say yes to global solidarity, to say yes to multilateralism, to say yes to keeping the gap between rich and poor from growing even wider,” added Mr. Müller.\n\nHe noted that 500 Nobel Laureates and economists are calling on the world’s leading economies (the G20, currently meeting in South Africa) to act: these leading experts have highlighted the fact that, between 2000 and 2024, the richest one per cent of the world’s population increased their wealth by 41 per cent, whilst the poorest half of the world’s population increased theirs by only one per cent.\n\nMr. Müller pointed out that the world’s least developed countries are particularly vulnerable to all manner of economic shocks, ranging from the climate crisis to trade tariffs and the major cuts to overseas aid and development support from the wealthiest nations.\n\n“The losses,” he warned, “will be devastating in sectors such as textile, leather, agribusiness and equipment – all vital to livelihoods and local economies.”\n\nBuilding resilience through industry\n\nUNIDO’s mission is to help countries to weather these shocks and, by industrialising, become more resilient and improve lives: In Bangladesh, UNIDO training programmes have helped garment factories meet international standards, creating millions of jobs for women; and in Nepal, young people are being equipped with coding and digital skills, closing the digital divide.\n\nMeanwhile, in Sudan, the agency is supporting agribusiness, targeting smallholders and entrepreneurs, and helping young people and women to access finance, readying the private sector for a time of peace and stability.\n\nOn Saturday, two major outcomes were achieved: guidelines for scaling up UNIDO support – focusing on transferring technology and knowhow – were agreed, and the ministers committed to modernising industry, finding the money to make it happen, and working more closely together in line with the UN’s global goals.\n\nThe commitments made in Riyadh mark a decisive step toward ensuring that millions of people in the world’s most vulnerable nations can thrive in an interconnected global economy.",

Many of these countries struggle with poverty, conflict, and climate problems.\n\n**What happened** – At the Eleventh Ministerial Meeting of LDCs, ministers pledged to speed up industrial growth that benefits everyone. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) supports their efforts by helping industries create jobs and improve skills. For example, in Bangladesh, UNIDO helped garment factories create millions of jobs for women, and in Nepal, young people are learning digital skills. Sudan, despite war, is preparing for peace by supporting farmers and small businesses.\n\n**Impact** – This meeting is important because it brings focus to countries often left behind in global progress. Experts warn the gap between rich and poor is growing. By agreeing to work together and modernize industries, these countries aim to protect their economies from problems like climate change and trade barriers. This could improve lives by creating jobs and reducing poverty.\n\n**What's next step** – The ministers agreed on guidelines to increase UNIDO’s support, especially by sharing technology and knowledge.

Le Soudan, malgré la guerre, se prépare à la paix en soutenant les agriculteurs et les petites entreprises.\n\n**Impact** – Cette réunion est importante car elle met l’accent sur des pays souvent oubliés dans les progrès mondiaux. Des experts alertent sur l’élargissement de l’écart entre riches et pauvres. En acceptant de travailler ensemble et de moderniser leurs industries, ces pays veulent protéger leurs économies contre des problèmes comme le changement climatique et les barrières commerciales. Cela pourrait améliorer la vie en créant des emplois et en réduisant la pauvreté.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les ministres ont convenu de directives pour augmenter le soutien de l’ONUDI, notamment en partageant la technologie et le savoir-faire.
