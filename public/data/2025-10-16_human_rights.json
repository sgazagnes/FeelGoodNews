      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Uruguay is a small country in South America known for passing laws that support personal freedoms, such as legalizing marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion. Until now, euthanasia—helping seriously ill people end their lives—was not allowed by law in most Latin American countries.\n\n**What happened** – On Wednesday, Uruguay’s Senate voted to approve a law called the “Dignified Death” bill. This law allows adult citizens or residents who are mentally capable and suffering from incurable, terminal illnesses to choose assisted suicide. The vote was 20 in favor out of 31 lawmakers present, following months of debate and earlier approval by the lower house. This makes Uruguay the first mostly Catholic country in Latin America to pass such a law through legislation.\n\n**Impact** – This law gives people with severe, painful illnesses the right to end their lives peacefully and with dignity. It is important because it respects personal choice at the end of life and offers legal protection for patients and doctors involved. Uruguay joins only a few countries worldwide with similar laws. People like Beatriz Gelos, who has lived with a serious nerve disease for 20 years, say the law is compassionate and humane. The law also reflects changing opinions in Uruguay, where over 60% of people now support euthanasia.\n\n**What’s next step** – Now that the law is passed, Uruguay will create rules to guide how euthanasia can be safely and fairly provided. Medical professionals will decide how to help patients while respecting their own beliefs. The law may inspire other countries in Latin America to consider similar changes.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Uruguay has made history by legally allowing euthanasia, offering terminally ill people a new choice for a peaceful and dignified end to life.",

      "title": "Digital education in Chiapas: A lever for a better future for young girls",
      "summary": "The future of these girls depends on creating a space where women can fulfill their dreams, share their knowledge, and shape the future of Mexico.",
      "content": "By Frida Ibarra\n\nIn the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, where mist curls over green mountains, my grandmother still lives in the small rural community where she raised her family. She never learned to read or write.\n\nMy mother, determined to continue her studies, left that village as a teenager to attend school in a nearby town, a difficult journey that few girls from her community could make at the time.\n\nI grew up with privileges my mother and grandmother never had: a steady place in school, access to books, and later, the internet. That generational leap from illiteracy to digital access shapes everything I do. It’s the compass that guides me in making sure young girls in Chiapas can use technology not only to learn, but to lead.\n\nThe stakes are high. Chiapas is one of Mexico’s poorest states. According to the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL) in Mexico, 74.2 percent of the population lives in poverty, with 46.5 percent in extreme poverty. Women’s participation in the formal workforce is just 31 percent, far below the national average of 45 percent, and most women work informally in subsistence agriculture or small-scale vending, earning around MXN 5,200 a month (about USD 260) without benefits or job security.\n\nIlliteracy remains a significant barrier. Statewide, rates hover around 16–17 percent, but among Indigenous women, they rise to between 25–30 percent. About 28 percent of Chiapas residents speak Indigenous languages such as Tzotzil, Tzeltal, and Chol, yet most educational and digital resources are in Spanish, creating major linguistic barriers and often alienating students from their cultural roots.\n\nInternet penetration in rural Chiapas is among the lowest in Mexico: only about 35 percent of rural households have access, compared to 75 percent in urban areas. Many community centers rely on outdated desktop computers and intermittent electricity, sometimes supported only by solar panels. In some villages, one computer is shared among 20 or more students.\n\nViolence adds another layer of restriction. In 2024, the Feminist Observatory recorded 197 violent deaths of women in Chiapas, 63 of them confirmed femicides. Such threats make it harder for girls to attend school or take part in after-school programs safely.\n\nSome initiatives work within these constraints. The Low-Tech Program, supported by UNICEF, equips rural teachers with mobile-friendly, high-quality lesson plans. Tecnolochicas is a program that introduces girls aged 12–17 to coding, robotics, and other STEM skills, where participants improve their digital skills by 60 percent, and leave with more confidence and higher aspirations for tech-related careers. Their projects range from web design to AI, with a gender perspective.\n\nIntegrating Indigenous culture into digital education has also shown results. Co-developing STEM content in local languages not only improves retention, it also builds cultural pride, a critical factor in keeping girls engaged in school. One example is Mexico’s recent initiative to translate 180 new textbooks into 20 Indigenous languages, led by the Secretary of Public Education, aiming to foster both educational inclusion and cultural pride.\n\nThe fourth wave of feminism in Mexico, marked by youth leadership and digital activism, has found fertile ground in Chiapas. Girls trained in coding are creating websites for women’s rights collectives, running social media campaigns against domestic violence, and analyzing femicide data to support grassroots advocacy.\n\nThese collaborations between community organizations and tech-trained youth are a quiet but determined resistance to systemic inequalities, one that insists cultural preservation and progress can go hand in hand.\n\nStudies from the World Bank suggest that sustained investment in rural digital education could cut illiteracy in Chiapas by 10 percent within a decade. With more local tech hubs, young women could lead economic development through businesses, cooperatives, and cultural projects, without leaving the place they call home.\n\nBut without long-term funding and policy support, poverty and gender violence will continue to limit opportunity. The digital divide will deepen, and another generation of women will remain shut out of the digital economy.\n\nThe future of these girls depends on creating a space where women can fulfill their dreams, share their knowledge, and shape the future of Mexico. It begins with identifying and understanding the specific issues that women face, followed by a response that offers empathy and support. It is only through these actions that we can truly unleash their potential and create a more just and prosperous society.\n\nI think back to my grandmother, whose world was limited by the absence of literacy, and my mother, who left home to pursue an education. Now, I see girls in Chiapas climbing a ladder my family could never reach. That ladder is fragile, but we’re building it brick by brick.",

      "content": "The real problem with Britain's asylum hotels - and the woman with a bold idea to solve it\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Tom Symonds News correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nKate Wareing has dedicated her career to helping people who find themselves in a crisis because they have nowhere to live. It's clearly personal. She worked as a housing officer at the age of 18, remembers sleeping on a sofa herself when a relationship broke up, and now in her early 50s, feels she is only a home owner because of \"luck and age\". \"Everybody needs the security of a home,\" she says. And now Kate, who is the chief executive of an Oxfordshire housing association, has an idea that she thinks could help the government with one of its most pressing challenges: how to empty asylum hotels by 2029. The pledge was made when tensions and anger rose during the summer, in communities where some regard asylum seekers as a threat to local safety. The cost of putting asylum seekers in local hotels is also \"cripplingly expensive,\" points out Kate - and she makes a bold claim: the cost could be cut from about £54,000 a year to just £4,000, for each asylum seeker, by moving them to social housing.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Protests and counter-protests outside the Bell Hotel in Epping\n\nInstead of paying private contractors to provide hotel rooms, as it does now, she wants the government to pay councils and housing associations to buy more properties, adding them to the nation's social housing stock, to benefit migrants and others in need of a home. The BBC has been told her proposal has been discussed with several government departments, including the Treasury and the Home Office. Officials are talking to nearly 200 councils about a series of pilot projects, though the Home Office won't give details. The question is, could it really work - if private companies haven't managed to source enough accommodation for asylum seekers, what's to say a council could? And would this plan really help to calm the strident public debate, in the wake of the protests and counter-protests outside the Bell Hotel in Epping and elsewhere this year - or might it even exacerbate it?\n\nThe pandemic fuelled the problem\n\nThere is no doubt tensions have been increasing. In July 2015 a coastguard in Dover told the BBC that two migrants had been rescued from a dinghy just offshore in the Channel. It was so surprising that it made the news. At that time people typically hid in lorries to get across the Channel. But during the Covid-19 pandemic, there were fewer lorries and would-be stowaways increasingly began using inflatable boats instead. Small boat arrivals accounted for a relatively small 4% of total immigration to the UK for the year to June 2025, but the numbers are rising.\n\nThe pandemic also rapidly increased the use of hotels to house asylum seekers. Successive administrations have banned asylum seekers from working for their first year in the UK - they didn't want the opportunity for a job to become a \"pull factor\" - so it falls to the government to support them. The Conservatives turned to the private sector for help, handing contracts to three companies - Serco, Clearsprings Ready Homes and Mears - to provide beds. The problem was, they ran out.\n\nGetty Images Small boat arrivals account for a relatively small percentage of total immigration to the UK\n\nThen, as lockdowns struck, hotels emptied, providing a useful source of emergency accommodation. The rooms are, however, more expensive than renting houses. In October 2025, the government was spending £5.5m per day on them. At one point, under the Conservatives, there were 400 hotels in use but they managed to reduce the number over time. While Labour has closed three hotels since July 2024, there are still 210, housing around 32,000 people.\n\n'Put them in a camp'\n\nThis summer, the argument moved to the streets, with protesters demanding the closure of asylum hotels. Lorraine Cavanagh, campaigning outside the Britannia Hotel in London's Canary Wharf, told me: \"I don't know who they are. They have no background, they have no passports, they are unidentified men who can walk around and do what they want to do with no consequences. \"Their beliefs are not the same as ours. They are coming in and trying to disturb and change things, that we are not used to.\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images Several protests about asylum hotels have taken place across the country, including in Canary Wharf, London\n\nSome protesters have another suggestion: put them in a military camp. Rakib Ehsan, a senior fellow at the centre-right Policy Exchange think tank, agrees this could be useful on a temporary basis. \"At least they would be somewhat separated from local communities,\" he says. Two large former Ministry of Defence sites are currently being used for asylum seekers - Napier Barracks, near Folkestone, and a former RAF base at Wethersfield in Essex. In 2021 the High Court found Napier Barracks, which is capable of housing 300 male migrants, to be overcrowded and filthy, requiring the government to take action.\n\nThe other facility, Wethersfield, which contains bedrooms, recreational areas and places for worship, is being expanded. Eventually more than 1,200 beds will be available. Residents can come and go, but the High Court was previously told Wethersfield was like a prison. Three migrants bringing a case against the former Home Secretary described \"tensions and outbreaks of violence\" within its walls. These \"large sites\" are not cheap either. The government spent £49m refurbishing Wethersfield, far more than had been estimated. A programme to open accommodation at RAF Scampton was also abandoned in 2024 after the cost ballooned to £60m. The public financial watchdog, the National Audit Office, concluded in March 2024 that these large sites would cost even more than hotels. Questioned by MPs in June 2025, the Environment Minister Angela Eagle said the government was moving away from \"asbestos-filled buildings, poisoned land, unexploded ordinance and all those sorts of things on old army bases\".\n\nGetty Images Bibby Stockholm: the vessel was controversially used to house hundreds of asylum seekers while their applications were processed until last year\n\nBut then in September 2025, Defence Secretary John Healey popped up, during the wave of anti-migrant protests, and revealed he had tasked his planners with identifying more military sites. Did the need for beds become greater, or did the rhetoric around using barracks for people who claim to be fleeing persecution become more acceptable, as Reform edged up in the opinion polls? Possibly both. Plans are yet to be revealed. Either way, what the government really needs now, is lots of cheaper, and better places for them to stay.\n\nPrivate sector problem\n\nHotels and military bases are used for \"emergency accommodation\" when there isn't enough so-called \"dispersal accommodation\" in communities around the country, which often takes the form of Houses in Multiple Occupation, or HMOs. This is where at least three people \"not from the same household\", live together, sharing a bathroom and a kitchen. Three main private contractors use public money to find HMOs on the open market. One, Mears, went on a spending spree across the north-east of England in 2023 and early 2024 buying 221 properties for more than £20m. But many flats and houses are rented from private landlords.\n\nAnother provider, Serco, has 1,000 leased properties for asylum accommodation. The third, Clearsprings Ready Homes, has made £187m in the last six years supporting 30,000 migrants, though half of them are in hotels. So these companies are competing with all of us, and local councils, for suitable properties. Planning applications for HMO status have been rising steadily since 2009, according to the property data company Searchland, though smaller HMOs don't need planning permission. There can be public opposition to attempts to use HMOs for migrants, just as there is with hotels, which is one factor contributing to a shortage. Another is that in some areas few rental properties are available at the very low rents the government contracts will pay.\n\nRenting or buying?\n\nThis could be seen as a challenge to Kate Wareing's plan for housing associations and councils to provide properties instead. If the three private companies contracted by the government struggle, won't councils and housing associations have the same problem? \"We would shop in a different way,\" she says. Often the asylum accommodation companies are looking for the cheapest private rented houses, usually in areas with lots of asylum seekers already, she says, fuelling community tensions. But councils and housing associations could plan more carefully where to go shopping, she argues, and there are other sources of property they might be able to get hold of more easily. For example, they could buy up property in housing developments. Builders usually have to offer social housing as part of any new development, in order to get planning permission. There has been a drop in first-time buyers recently.\n\nUnder Kate Wareing's plan, the government would give a council or housing association an average of £80,000 to buy and do up a property\n\n\"We've got builders approaching us asking if we want to buy more homes on some new-build sites than we would normally be being offered,\" she says, estimating that might make another 5,000 properties available in the next few years. Her housing authority alone buys 20 a year, and purchases would be spread across the country. Other experts the BBC spoke to thought this was a reasonable target. In outline, her plan would work like this: the government gives a council or housing association an average of £80,000 to buy and do up a property. They would also need to borrow some money on top of that, but the interest they pay is usually less than a company would.\n\nThese properties would be used for current social housing tenants, and when they move out of their existing houses, asylum seekers would move in - after any necessary repairs had been made - with the government paying their rent to the councils and associations to cover their costs. \"We'll have 10 new houses that we can use to relieve some of the needs of our existing residents and then we can also move asylum seekers into any houses that they are vacating,\" she argues. In the longer term, \"there will be 10 more houses to let to the local population or to use for other types of homelessness need.\" She calculates an investment of £1.75bn could enable the purchase and renovation of 14,000 to 16,000 homes. The costs of rent would be similar to the cost of the housing benefit asylum seekers are not allowed to claim. Her analysis was checked by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which has its own model for assessing development opportunities being considered by housing associations. They said it \"stood up fine\".\n\n'An asylum system in chaos'\n\nRakib Ehsan of Policy Exchange argues there should be more social housing, but for British citizens not asylum seekers. But Kate Wareing says that under her plan, there would be homes for both. Rakib Ehsan also emphasises the concerns some people have over public safety, as long as most migrants continue to be young men from \"deeply patriarchal societies\". \"If we look at the demographic characteristics associated with small boat migrants in particular who went to the UK, they tend to originate from parts of the world which have a very different view when it comes to the treatment of women and girls,\" he says. But Kate believes her plan would be politically acceptable, because it makes newly refurbished homes available for local people who need them. Plus she argues asylum seekers could end up sharing a home with others in need, potentially reducing social tensions.\n\nGetty Images Wethersfield, a former RAF base in Essex, is being expanded\n\nIf the government wants to change tack, it has a chance next year, when there is a break point in the 10-year contracts with the three asylum housing providers. John Perry, policy adviser to the Chartered Institute of Housing says: \"That's why this idea has currency. It is very encouraging local authorities appear to want to work with the government.\" There is a risk, though, that a version of Kate Wareing's plan would take too long to put into effect, if it is to help the government meet its 2029 deadline. The Home Office insists the government inherited \"an asylum system in chaos\" and that it has reduced the backlog of claims by 24%, returned 35,000 people \"with no right to be here\", and cut hotel spending by over half a billion pounds. \"We are looking at a range of more sustainable, cost-effective and locally led sites including disused accommodation, industrial and ex-military sites, so we can reduce the impact on communities and taxpayers,\" a spokesperson said. If the government can meet its pledge to close the asylum hotels, the prize would be saving of £1bn per year, according to the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. But failure would give the government's main opponent, Reform, a big stick with which to beat it, at the next election. This issue could help decide the outcome.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The UK houses many asylum seekers in hotels, which is very expensive and has caused protests in some communities. The government wants to stop using hotels for asylum seekers by 2029 but needs a better way to provide homes.\n\n**What happened** – Kate Wareing, a housing expert, suggested that instead of paying private companies to rent hotel rooms, the government should give money to local councils and housing groups to buy and fix homes. These homes would be added to social housing and used to house asylum seekers and others in need.\n\n**Impact** – This plan could cut the cost of housing one asylum seeker from about £54,000 a year to just £4,000. It would also provide better living spaces and spread housing more evenly, which might reduce community tensions. Buying homes directly from builders could provide thousands of new properties.\n\n**What's next step** – The government is discussing pilot projects with nearly 200 councils to try out this idea. The plan could start when contracts with private housing companies end next year. If successful, it could help meet the 2029 goal to close asylum hotels.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new approach to housing asylum seekers through social housing could save money and improve living conditions while easing community concerns.\n\n",

Le gouvernement veut arrêter d'utiliser ces hôtels d'ici 2029, mais cherche une meilleure solution pour loger ces personnes.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Kate Wareing, une spécialiste du logement, a proposé que le gouvernement donne de l'argent aux conseils locaux et associations de logement pour acheter et rénover des maisons. Ces logements seraient ajoutés au parc social et utilisés pour héberger les demandeurs d'asile et d'autres personnes dans le besoin.\n\n**Impact** – Ce plan pourrait réduire le coût annuel pour loger un demandeur d'asile de 54 000 £ à seulement 4 000 £. Il offrirait aussi de meilleurs logements et répartirait le logement plus équitablement, ce qui pourrait diminuer les tensions dans les communautés. Acheter directement auprès des promoteurs pourrait fournir des milliers de nouveaux logements.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le gouvernement discute de projets pilotes avec près de 200 conseils locaux pour tester cette idée. Le plan pourrait commencer à la fin des contrats avec les sociétés privées l'année prochaine. S'il réussit, il aidera à atteindre l'objectif de fermeture des hôtels pour demandeurs d'asile en 2029.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Une nouvelle approche du logement des demandeurs d'asile par le biais du logement social pourrait faire économiser de l'argent, améliorer les conditions de vie et apaiser les inquiétudes des communautés.\n\n",

El gobierno quiere dejar de usar hoteles para solicitantes de asilo para 2029, pero necesita una mejor forma de proporcionar viviendas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Kate Wareing, experta en vivienda, propuso que el gobierno dé dinero a los ayuntamientos y asociaciones de vivienda para comprar y arreglar casas. Estas casas se agregarían a la vivienda social y se usarían para alojar a solicitantes de asilo y otras personas necesitadas.\n\n**Impacto** – Este plan podría reducir el costo de alojar a un solicitante de asilo de unas 54,000 libras al año a solo 4,000 libras. También proporcionaría mejores espacios para vivir y distribuiría las viviendas de forma más equitativa, lo que podría reducir las tensiones comunitarias. Comprar casas directamente a constructores podría ofrecer miles de nuevas propiedades.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El gobierno está hablando con casi 200 ayuntamientos para probar proyectos piloto. El plan podría comenzar cuando terminen los contratos con las empresas privadas el próximo año. Si tiene éxito, ayudaría a cumplir la meta de cerrar los hoteles para solicitantes de asilo en 2029.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Un nuevo enfoque para alojar solicitantes de asilo mediante vivienda social podría ahorrar dinero, mejorar las condiciones de vida y calmar las preocupaciones de las comunidades.\n\n",
