      "title": "Hundreds of new species found in a hidden world beneath the Pacific",
      "summary": "As demand for critical metals grows, scientists have taken a rare, close look at life on the deep Pacific seabed where mining may soon begin. Over five years and 160 days at sea, researchers documented nearly 800 species, many previously unknown. Test mining reduced animal abundance and diversity significantly, though the overall impact was smaller than expected. The study offers vital clues for how future mining could reshape one of the planet’s most fragile ecosystems.",
      "content": "The global demand for critical metals is rising quickly, prompting many countries to explore the possibility of extracting these valuable resources from the ocean floor. A new international study has revealed that this push toward deep-sea mining may have less overall environmental impact than scientists once feared. At the same time, the research shows clear local damage, with species diversity dropping by about one third along the paths cut by mining equipment.\n\nThe study also uncovered a major surprise. Hundreds of previously unknown species were found living nearly 4,000 meters below the ocean's surface, highlighting just how little is known about these remote environments.\n\nExploring One of Earth's Least Known Ecosystems\n\nMarine biologists from multiple countries joined forces in a large research effort to document life on the deep-sea floor of the Pacific Ocean, one of the most unexplored regions on the planet.\n\nThe research, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, was driven in part by growing commercial and geopolitical interest in the area.\n\n\"Critical metals are needed for our green transition, and they are in short supply. Several of these metals are found in large quantities on the deep-sea floor, but until now, no one has shown how they can be extracted or what environmental impact this would have,\" says marine biologist Thomas Dahlgren, that together with Helena Wiklund, also at the University of Gothenburg, have participated in the research project.\n\nFive Years of Research and 160 Days at Sea\n\nThe project followed the International Seabed Authority's (ISA) guidelines for baseline studies and environmental impact assessments (see fact box).\n\nOver five years, researchers cataloged marine life and tested mining impacts in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast region of the Pacific Ocean located between Mexico and Hawaii. The results showed that areas directly disturbed by mining equipment experienced a 37 percent decline in animal numbers and a 32 percent reduction in species diversity.\n\n\"The research required 160 days at sea and five years of work. Our study will be important for the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which regulates mineral mining in international waters,\" says Thomas Dahlgren.\n\nLife at 4,000 Meters Below the Surface\n\nThe study area lies 4,000 meters beneath the ocean surface, where sunlight never reaches and food is extremely limited. In this environment, the sediment layer grows at a rate of just one thousandth of a millimeter per year.\n\nTo put the scarcity of life into perspective, a single seafloor sample from the North Sea can contain up to 20,000 animals. A similar sample from the deep Pacific seabed contains roughly the same number of species, but only about 200 individual animals.\n\nResearchers collected 4,350 animals larger than 0.3 mm living in and on the seabed. From these samples, 788 species were identified. Most belonged to groups such as marine bristle worms, crustaceans, and mollusks, including snails and mussels.\n\nThe team also identified a new solitaire coral, that are described in another study.\n\nUnknown Species Ranges and Long-Term Risks\n\n\"I have been working in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone for over 13 years, and this is by far the largest study that has been conducted. In Gothenburg, we led the identification of marine polychaete worms. Since most species have not been described previously, molecular (DNA) data was crucial in facilitating studies of biodiversity and ecology on the seabed,\" says Thomas Dahlgren.\n\nAs the inventory progressed, scientists noticed that deep-sea communities changed naturally over time, likely in response to shifts in how much food reached the ocean floor. However, researchers still do not know how widely these species are distributed across the Pacific's deep-sea regions.\n\n\"It is now important to try to predict the risk of biodiversity loss as a result of mining. This requires us to investigate the biodiversity of the 30 percent of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone that has been protected. At present, we have virtually no idea what lives there,\" says Adrian Glover, senior author from the Natural History Museum of London.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The global demand for important metals is growing fast. Some of these metals are found on the deep seabed of the Pacific Ocean, where mining companies want to start extracting them. But little is known about the life that exists in these deep ocean areas or how mining would affect it.\n\n**What happened** – Over five years and 160 days at sea, an international team of scientists studied a part of the Pacific Ocean floor called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. They found nearly 800 species of animals living about 4,000 meters below the surface, many of which were never known before. They also tested mining equipment and saw that it reduced the number of animals and types of species by about one third in the areas it disturbed.\n\n**Impact** – This study is important because it shows that deep-sea mining will cause local damage to marine life, but the total impact might be less than expected. It also reveals a hidden world full of unknown creatures, highlighting how much we still need to learn about deep ocean ecosystems. Knowing what lives there helps decision-makers balance mining with protecting these fragile environments.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers want to study the protected parts of the seabed to understand more about the animals living there.

      "summary": "In an age defined by resource scarcity, economic constraints and environmental urgency, leadership in wastewater...\nThe post Guest Idea: The Cradle to Cradle Mindset Is A Call for Bold Leadership appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "In an age defined by resource scarcity, economic constraints and environmental urgency, leadership in wastewater management is no longer about mere compliance or disposal. It’s about vision.\n\nThe cradle-to-cradle philosophy, where waste is viewed not as a burden but as a resource, offers a transformative model for wastewater treatment plants and private industry. This shift requires bold leadership that can recognize and harness the untapped potential flowing through our sewers.\n\nAt its core, cradle-to-cradle thinking sees wastewater not as the end of a linear process but the beginning of a regenerative cycle. Every drop contains recoverable energy, nutrients and water – assets that can be refined, reused and reinvested. Today’s waste, under this model, becomes tomorrow’s want.\n\nUtilities around the country are already demonstrating what’s possible. Through anaerobic digestion, wastewater treatment plants capture biogas, a renewable methane energy source that can power plant operations, fuel a fleet or feed local electrical grids. Nutrient recovery systems such as Milwaukee’s Milorganite® extract valuable phosphorus and nitrogen to produce fertilizers, reducing the need for synthetic alternatives. In some parts of the country, advanced treatment technologies purify wastewater to such a degree that it can be reused in agriculture, industry or even potable supply.\n\nCradle-to-cradle thinking would take these examples and add private industry’s waste to the stream, producing even more benefits for the utility and its customers. For example, additional energy could be produced from the organic waste from breweries and other industrial processes, saving money for all involved and reducing impacts on climate.\n\nDutch Lessons\n\nAquaMinerals, a nonprofit in the Netherlands, is showing what can be accomplished in this realm. The organization, a collective of 11 Dutch drinking water utilities and nine wastewater authorities, recovers byproducts used in the water and wastewater treatment process and turns them into valuable products used in agriculture and gardening, tiles and ceramics, and even face cream.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) is moving down the cradle-to-cradle path by performing a market study to:\n\nDetermine what industries in the region create organic waste in their production process,\n\nExplore whether this waste could be effectively digested to produce energy, and\n\nDetermine the potential cost savings of providing this waste material to the MMSD wastewater plants for co-digestion to produce energy.\n\nThe study will be foundational to MMSD’s goal of using existing infrastructure for receiving waste, producing energy, reducing our ratepayer costs for energy and providing a safe, economic disposal method for industry.\n\nBut implementing cradle-to-cradle solutions isn’t just a technical upgrade; it’s also a leadership challenge.\n\nSeeing The Big Picture and Taking the Long View\n\nToo often, wastewater leaders only look at their utility and don’t consider how the utility is part of a broader ecosystem. They don’t understand that through collaborative efforts they can make their utilities more streamlined and less costly while improving the environment. It demands system thinking, investment in innovation and collaboration across sectors. Through this journey, leaders must also realize that they are an anchor institution, meaning their utility will be around for generations to come. Taking this approach allows leaders to overcome institutional inertia, navigate regulatory frameworks and engage the public in reshaping how we view waste.\n\nThis leadership challenge extends to the industrial market as well. Motivated to reduce their bottom line, companies must look outside the norm and embrace these sustainable changes. Change will come with challenges, but companies should look to partner with local utilities to share risk, save money and improve their community.\n\nThe cradle-to-cradle approach reframes wastewater treatment plants as resource recovery hubs, integral to circular economies and climate resilience. The leaders who embrace this paradigm shift are not just managing waste; they’re shaping a new future.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nThis article was written by Kevin Shafer, Executive Director of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District.",

Instead of just getting rid of waste, new ideas focus on using it as a helpful resource.\n\n**What happened** – The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) and other utilities are adopting the cradle-to-cradle philosophy. This means they treat wastewater as the start of a cycle that recovers energy, nutrients, and clean water. For example, MMSD is studying how to use organic waste from local industries to create energy. In the Netherlands, a group of utilities turns wastewater byproducts into products like fertilizers and even face cream.\n\n**Impact** – This approach changes how we see wastewater plants—from places that only clean water to hubs that produce energy and useful materials. It helps save money, reduces pollution, and supports local communities. By working together, industries and utilities can share resources and risks, making the system stronger and more efficient.\n\n**What's next step** – MMSD will use its study results to start using organic waste for energy production. This will lower costs and make wastewater treatment more sustainable. Other utilities and industries may follow, leading to bigger changes in how waste is handled across the country.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Bold leadership and teamwork are turning wastewater from a problem into a valuable resource that benefits the environment and communities.",
