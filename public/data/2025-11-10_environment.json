      "content": "In California's Death Valley, where summer heat often surpasses 120 degrees Fahrenheit, survival appears almost impossible. Yet, among the cracked soil and intense sunlight, one native plant not only endures but flourishes.\n\nThat plant, Tidestromia oblongifolia, has helped scientists at Michigan State University reveal how life can persist in such extreme conditions. Their findings offer a potential guide for developing crops that can survive in an increasingly hot climate.\n\nIn a study published in Current Biology, Research Foundation Professor Seung Yon \"Sue\" Rhee and Research Specialist Karine Prado report that T. oblongifolia actually grows more quickly under Death Valley's summer conditions. The plant accomplishes this by fine-tuning its photosynthetic system to resist the damaging effects of heat.\n\nA Plant That Grows Stronger in the Heat\n\nFor Prado, the project began with a simple question: how can this plant remain green and healthy when most others would wither within hours?\n\n\"When we first brought these seeds back to the lab, we were fighting just to get them to grow,\" Prado said. \"But once we managed to mimic Death Valley conditions in our growth chambers, they took off.\"\n\nWorking with colleagues in the Rhee lab at MSU's Plant Resilience Institute, Prado used custom-built growth chambers to reproduce the desert's harsh light and extreme daily temperature shifts. The results were astonishing. In just 10 days, T. oblongifolia tripled its biomass. Meanwhile, other related species known for their heat tolerance stopped growing entirely.\n\nThe World's Most Heat-Tolerant Plant\n\nAfter only two days in extreme heat, T. oblongifolia expanded its photosynthetic comfort zone, allowing it to keep producing energy efficiently. Within two weeks, its optimal photosynthetic temperature rose to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) -- higher than that of any major crop on record.\n\n\"This is the most heat-tolerant plant ever documented,\" Rhee said. \"Understanding how T. oblongifolia acclimates to heat gives us new strategies to help crops adapt to a warming planet.\"\n\nHow the Desert Survivor Works\n\nUsing a combination of physiological tests, live imaging, and genomic analysis, the research team uncovered how T. oblongifolia coordinates multiple biological systems to survive.\n\nUnder Death Valley-level heat, the plant's mitochondria -- the structures that generate energy -- move closer to the chloroplasts, where photosynthesis occurs. At the same time, the chloroplasts reshape into distinctive \"cup-like\" forms never before observed in higher plants. These adaptations may help the plant capture and recycle carbon dioxide more efficiently, maintaining energy production even under stress.\n\nWithin 24 hours of heat exposure, thousands of genes adjust their activity. Many are involved in shielding proteins, membranes, and photosynthetic machinery from damage. The plant also increases production of an enzyme known as Rubisco activase, which helps keep photosynthesis functioning smoothly at high temperatures.\n\nLessons for Future Agriculture\n\nWith global temperatures expected to rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, extreme heat is already reducing yields for essential crops like wheat, maize, and soybeans. As the global population grows, scientists are racing to find ways to sustain food production.\n\n\"T. oblongifolia shows us that plants have the capacity to adapt to extreme temperatures,\" Rhee said. \"If we can learn how to replicate those mechanisms in crops, it could transform agriculture in a hotter world.\"\n\nLearning From Nature's Toughest Survivors\n\nFor decades, plant biology has centered on model species that are easy to cultivate, such as Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. Rhee believes it is time to look beyond these familiar plants and study species that have evolved to endure the world's harshest environments.\n\n\"Desert plants have spent millions of years solving the challenges we're only beginning to face,\" she said. \"We finally have the tools, such as genomics, high-resolution live imaging and systems biology, to learn from them. What we need now is broader support to pursue this kind of research.\"\n\nHer lab is already applying these insights, studying how the genes and cellular structures that give T. oblongifolia its extraordinary resilience might be used to make food crops more heat-tolerant.\n\n\"This research doesn't just tell us how one desert plant beats the heat,\" Prado said. \"It gives us a roadmap for how all plants might adapt to a changing climate.\"",

      "summary": "Researchers from the University of Vienna discovered MISO bacteria that use iron minerals to oxidize toxic sulfide, creating energy and producing sulfate. This biological process reshapes how scientists understand global sulfur and iron cycles. By outpacing chemical reactions, these microbes could help stop the spread of oceanic dead zones and maintain ecological balance.",
      "content": "An international research team led by microbiologists Marc Mussmann and Alexander Loy at the University of Vienna has uncovered a completely new type of microbial metabolism. The newly identified microorganisms, known as MISO bacteria, are able to \"breathe\" iron minerals by oxidizing toxic sulfide. The scientists discovered that the reaction between hydrogen sulfide -- a poisonous gas -- and solid iron minerals is not only a chemical process, but also a biological one. In this newly revealed pathway, adaptable microbes living in marine sediments and wetland soils remove toxic sulfide and use it as an energy source for growth. These bacteria may also play an important role in preventing the expansion of oxygen-depleted \"dead zones\" in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nThe findings were recently published in Nature.\n\nHow Microbes Power Earth's Element Cycles\n\nThe movement of key elements such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and iron through the environment occurs through what are known as biogeochemical cycles. These transformations take place through reduction and oxidation (redox) reactions that move elements between air, water, soil, rocks, and living things. Because these cycles regulate greenhouse gases, they have a direct influence on Earth's climate and temperature balance. Microorganisms drive nearly every step of these processes, using substances like sulfur and iron for respiration in much the same way humans rely on oxygen to metabolize food.\n\nSulfur and iron are particularly essential for microbial communities that live in oxygen-deprived habitats such as ocean floors, wetlands, and sediments. Sulfur can exist as a gas in the atmosphere, as sulfate dissolved in seawater, or locked within mineral deposits. Iron, on the other hand, shifts between different chemical forms depending on the availability of oxygen. When microbes process sulfur, they frequently change the form of iron at the same time, creating a tightly linked relationship between the two elements. This coupling affects nutrient cycling and influences the production or consumption of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Understanding these connections helps scientists predict how natural systems respond to environmental changes, including pollution and global warming.\n\nMicrobes That Use Iron to Eliminate Toxic Sulfide\n\nIn oxygen-poor settings such as marine sediments, wetlands, and underground aquifers, certain microbes produce hydrogen sulfide, a foul-smelling and highly toxic gas. Interactions between this sulfide and iron(III) oxide minerals -- essentially rust -- help keep sulfide levels under control. Until now, scientists thought this process happened only through chemical reactions that created elemental sulfur and iron monosulfide (FeS), the black mineral responsible for the dark color of low-oxygen beach sands.\n\n\"We show that this environmentally important redox reaction is not solely chemical,\" says Alexander Loy, research group leader at CeMESS, the Centre for Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science at the University of Vienna. \"Microorganisms can also harness it for growth.\"\n\nThe team's discovery reveals a new form of microbial energy production called MISO. This process connects the reduction of iron(III) oxide with the oxidation of sulfide. Unlike a purely chemical reaction, MISO directly generates sulfate, skipping intermediate steps in the sulfur cycle. \"MISO bacteria remove toxic sulfide and may help prevent the expansion of so-called 'dead zones' in aquatic environments, while fixing carbon dioxide for growth -- similar to plants,\" adds Marc Mussmann, senior scientist at CeMESS.\n\nA Fast, Widespread Process That Shapes the Planet\n\nIn laboratory experiments, the researchers found that the MISO reaction carried out by microbes happens faster than the same reaction when it occurs chemically. This indicates that microorganisms are likely the main force behind this transformation in natural environments. \"Diverse bacteria and archaea possess the genetic capacity for MISO,\" explains lead author Song-Can Chen, \"and they are found in a wide range of natural and human-made environments.\"\n\nAccording to the study, MISO activity in marine sediments could be responsible for as much as 7% of all global sulfide oxidation to sulfate. This process is fueled by the steady flow of reactive iron entering the oceans from rivers and melting glaciers. The research, supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) as part of the 'Microbiomes Drive Planetary Health' Cluster of Excellence, identifies a new biological mechanism linking the cycling of sulfur, iron, and carbon in oxygen-free environments.\n\n\"This discovery demonstrates the metabolic ingenuity of microorganisms and highlights their indispensable role in shaping Earth's global element cycles,\" concludes Alexander Loy.",

      "content": "Back from the brink: UK red kites aid Spanish cousins\n\n21 hours ago Share Save Katharine Da Costa South of England Share Save\n\nMore than 120 British-born red kite chicks have been released in south-west Spain\n\nA British red kite emerges from an aviary in the remote hills of western Spain and takes flight. At six months old, this is its first taste of freedom. Without a sound, it soars high in the sky above scrubland and within seconds disappears from view into a wooded valley in the distance. It is the latest release in a conservation story that has come full circle. Nearly four decades ago, the birds were extinct in England and Scotland with just a few pairs left in Wales.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, red kite chicks from Spain and Sweden were released in the Chilterns on the Oxfordshire-Buckinghamshire border. It proved so successful that the species is now thriving across the UK, with estimates of more than 6,000 mating pairs or about 15% of the world's population. Dr Ian Evans, from Natural England, was one of the early pioneers. He said: \"There were a lot of unknowns. The first lot we released, we thought they might just die or they might just move away. \"In 1991, we had our first breeding pairs and that was really an eye-opener because we thought 'well, this can be successful'. \"That was the springboard for establishing other release sites in England and Scotland.\"\n\nIan Evans A red kite chick from the original reintroduction project\n\nBritish-born red kite chicks have now been taken to south west Spain as part of a four-year project to revive the population there from the brink of extinction. The region has fewer than 50 mating pairs due to predators like the eagle owl and human factors such as illegal poisoning and electrocution. In 2022, conservationists were granted special licences from Natural England to collect red kite chicks, mostly from Northamptonshire, and send them over to the Extremadura region of Spain. More than 120 chicks have been collected, with about 30 exported each year.\n\nSimon Dudhill About 30 red kite chicks were collected from forests in England and relocated each year over the four-year project\n\nAbout the red kite It is one of Britain's largest birds of prey, known for its reddish-brown body, long wings, forked tail and distinctive \"mewing\" calls\n\nOnce considered a threat to game birds and domestic animals like cats and dogs, the red kite was hunted close to extinction in the UK and at one point there were just a few breeding pairs in central Wales\n\nRed kites are largely scavengers, feeding on carrion and small prey such as rabbits\n\nThe birds breed exclusively in Europe and are endangered due to illegal persecution through shooting, poisoning and trapping\n\nThe chicks have been relocated to Extremadura in Spain where the red kite population has been nearly wiped out\n\nThe chicks are flown to Madrid and then transported 240 miles (385km) south to a wildlife hospital in Villafranca de los Barros, run by Accion por el Mundo Salvaje (AMUS). When I arrive, the small team, led by ornithologist and project manager Alfonso Godino, are hard at work. Each chick has to be weighed, measured and tagged before being fitted with a GPS backpack which allows experts to track them. The birds look lifeless as they are manoeuvred into position. Mr Godino tells me they play dead when they feel under threat. Asked whether the tagging is painful, he says it is a minor discomfort, like having your ears pierced. Alfonso says the juveniles soon get used to the large tags, which are needed so they can be observed from the ground.\n\nRed kites are tagged and fitted with a GPS backpack to monitor their location\n\nThe birds are then moved to holding aviaries near the Portuguese border for two weeks to acclimatise to their new surroundings. The release site is quiet and remote. There is a strong stench of rotting flesh coming from a sheep's carcass that has been left to entice red kites to feed here. As the gate is removed, I half expect the chicks to rush out but, but apart from a few flutters inside the aviary, nothing happens. It takes several hours, as though they are building up courage, before one by one they leave the safety of the aviary behind and fly off into the wild.\n\n'Bittersweet moment'\n\n\"Now is the exciting moment when they are in the wild, they can learn to search for food, to avoid predators, to interact with other species in the area... thanks to the GPS we are going to closely monitor these birds we have released,\" Alfonso tells me. But this is a nerve-racking time for AMUS field technician Sofia Marrero. \"The mortality for raptors in general is really high during the first years of their life,\" she says. \"So now it's a little bit hard because you already know that some of them may not get to sexual maturity, so it's a bittersweet moment.\" In fact, only about a quarter of the red kites released during the project have survived. The biggest threat is from predators and natural causes. In 2023, eagle owls were responsible for killing half of the project's newly released red kite chicks. In response, the team at AMUS adapted how and when the chicks are released to increase their chances of survival.\n\nSebastien Comps, AMUS A tagged red kite takes its first flight into the wild\n\nA lot of work has also been done to adapt thousands of kilometres of power cables to reduce the risk of electrocution. But the biggest human risk to birds of prey is from illegal poisoning. Between 2020-2024, 3,060 red kites were tagged and fitted with GPS as part of the Life EuroKite project, spanning 40 project areas in 12 countries. By September 2024, 1,377 tagged red kites had died - 622 from natural causes, including predation, while 195 died from poisoning and 54 from illegal shooting. Experts say the figures represent just the \"tip of the iceberg\" in terms of illegal persecution. In the UK, the RSPB is working with European partners to provide advice on how to investigate cases of poisoning. A report by the charity last year revealed at least 1,344 birds of prey had been killed in the UK between 2009 and 2023.\n\n\"Raptor persecution is directly linked to game estates so in the lowlands pheasant and partridge and in the uplands grouse,\" Mark Thomas, head of investigations at RSPB says. \"All the statistics prove that... two thirds of all the convictions are for gamekeepers so these are people employed lawfully to control vermin they can control but on some estates some of these gamekeepers kill things that are fully protected,\" he adds. The charity believes licensing game estates would tackle the issue but that is disputed by the Countryside Alliance. In a statement, the non-profit organisation said: \"Any incident of raptor persecution is utterly condemnable, with the penalties already including a prison sentence along with an unlimited fine.\"\n\nAMUS Red kites are scavengers and feed on dead animals and are often the number one victim of poisoning incidents\n\nIn Spain, the relocation project in Extremadura has seen three mating pairs so far that have produced two surviving chicks. With more tagged red kites due to reach sexual maturity next year, it is hoped these numbers will multiply. \"There are still huge areas of southern Spain where the red kite was common three decades ago and is now almost extinct,\" Mr Godino says. \"So the next step is how we can apply this experience to other areas of Spain.\"",

Plus de 120 poussins ont été prélevés en Angleterre, équipés de traceurs GPS, puis relâchés après une période de soins et d’adaptation. Cela aide à renforcer la population espagnole, presque disparue.\n\n**Impact** – Le projet montre déjà des résultats avec trois nouveaux couples reproducteurs en Espagne qui ont eu des poussins. Le suivi des oiseaux aide les experts à mieux les protéger. Le projet lutte aussi contre les dangers comme l’électrocution sur les lignes électriques et les empoisonnements illégaux, qui causaient beaucoup de morts.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – À mesure que les oiseaux relocalisés atteignent l’âge adulte, les experts espèrent une croissance régulière de la population. Ils prévoient d’étendre cette méthode à d’autres régions d’Espagne où les milans royaux ont presque disparu, en utilisant les connaissances acquises.\n\n**En une phrase** – Le transfert de poussins de milans royaux britanniques en Espagne aide à sauver cette espèce menacée en augmentant leur nombre et en améliorant leurs chances de survie grâce à un suivi et une protection rigoureux.",

      "summary": "Deep beneath the ocean, scientists uncovered thriving microbial life in one of Earth’s harshest environments—an area with a pH of 12, where survival seems nearly impossible. Using lipid biomarkers instead of DNA, researchers revealed how these microbes persist by metabolizing methane and sulfate. The discovery not only sheds light on deep-sea carbon cycling but also suggests that life may have originated in similar extreme conditions, offering a glimpse into both Earth’s past and the limits of life itself.",
      "content": "In a new study, first author Palash Kumawat from the University of Bremen's Geosciences Department and his team investigated how microbes manage to survive in one of the planet's harshest underwater environments. They analyzed lipid biomarkers, specialized fat molecules that reveal biological activity, to uncover the organisms' survival strategies. The site's pH of 12 makes it one of the most alkaline environments ever documented, creating conditions that are exceptionally difficult for life to endure.\n\nBecause so few living cells exist there, detecting DNA is often impossible. Instead, the researchers used trace analysis techniques sensitive enough to identify even faint biochemical signals. \"But we were able to detect fats,\" says Kumawat, currently a PhD candidate in the Geosciences Department. \"With the help of these biomarkers we were able to obtain insights into the survival strategies of methane- and sulfate-metabolizing microbes in this extreme environment.\"\n\nMicrobial Clues Hidden in Deep-Sea Chemistry\n\nMicrobial life in the deep ocean plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, processing carbon and other elements far below the surface. The communities identified by Kumawat's team draw their energy not from sunlight but from minerals in rocks and gases like carbon dioxide and hydrogen, producing methane in the process -- an important greenhouse gas. These biochemical reactions occur independently of the ocean above, showing that these microbes operate in a self-contained ecosystem.\n\nThe lipid molecules also help determine whether the microbes are alive or remnants from ancient communities. Intact biomolecules suggest active or recently living cells, while degraded ones indicate fossilized \"geomolecules\" from long ago. Kumawat explains that combining isotope data with lipid biomarkers shows evidence of both modern and ancient microbial populations inhabiting this hostile environment. \"This distinction helps us when working in areas with extremely low biomass and nutrient deficiency,\" he notes.\n\nDiscovering Life at the Limits\n\nCo-author Dr. Florence Schubotz, an organic geochemist at MARUM -- Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen, emphasizes how remarkable the discovery is. \"What is fascinating about these findings is that life under these extreme conditions, such as high pH and low organic carbon concentrations, is even possible,\" she says. \"Until now, the presence of methane-producing microorganisms in this system has been presumed, but could not be directly confirmed. Furthermore, it is simply exciting to obtain insights into such a microbial habitat because we suspect that primordial life could have originated at precisely such sites.\"\n\nUncovering Hidden Volcanoes Beneath the Pacific\n\nThe team's samples came from sediment cores collected in 2022 during Expedition SO 292/2 aboard the Research Vessel Sonne. During this mission, scientists discovered previously unknown mud volcanoes in the Mariana forearc region and were able to collect samples directly from them.\n\nThe work forms part of the Cluster of Excellence \"The Ocean Floor -- Earth's Uncharted Interface.\" Building on their findings, Kumawat and his colleagues now plan to cultivate these microorganisms in controlled incubators to learn more about how they obtain nutrients and persist in such inhospitable environments.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Deep under the ocean, some places are so harsh that scientists thought no life could survive there. One of these places has a very high pH level of 12, making it extremely alkaline and tough for living things.\n\n**What happened** – In 2022, a team from the University of Bremen collected samples from mud volcanoes deep in the Mariana forearc region of the Pacific Ocean. Using special fat molecules called lipid biomarkers instead of DNA, they found microbes that live by using methane and sulfate for energy. These microbes survive without sunlight, relying on chemicals in the rocks and gases around them.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it shows that life can exist in places much harsher than previously known. It also helps scientists understand how carbon cycles deep in the ocean and suggests that life on Earth might have started in similar extreme places long ago.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers plan to grow these microbes in the lab to learn more about how they survive and get nutrients in such tough conditions. This could reveal more about the limits of life and how organisms adapt to extreme environments.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists found microbes living in a deep-sea environment with a pH of 12, revealing new details about life’s ability to survive in extreme conditions and Earth’s early history.",
