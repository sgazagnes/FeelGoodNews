      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nBuilding new foundations\n\nWelcome to the third installment of The Optimist Daily’s Annual Local Changemakers series. Every Friday, we’re celebrating ten extraordinary individuals and organizations transforming their communities through heart-led innovation. This week, we’re spotlighting changemakers who are rebuilding, physically and culturally, what has been neglected or shut out.\n\nToday, we travel to Kit Carson, Colorado, where longtime resident Amy Howlett Johnson has spent decades leading the charge to revitalize her rural town through affordable housing, infrastructure renewal, and fierce local pride. Her work is a testament to what’s possible when you stay rooted and invest deeply in the people and place you call home.\n\nWhen a home means more than shelter\n\nOn the Eastern Plains of Colorado sits Kit Carson, a town of just 250 people and no public library, no parks department, and, until recently, no homes available to rent. When Amy Howlett Johnson moved there in 1995, she found a place with deep history, but with dwindling hope in its future: vacant homes, businesses closing, and a school teetering from low enrollment. Rather than leave, Amy dug in.\n\nWhat started as a mother’s desire to keep her children in a functioning local school has grown into a transformative force for rural resilience. In 2005, she helped reactivate the then-dormant nonprofit Kit Carson Rural Development (KCRD) and quickly became its driving engine. What followed is one of rural America’s quietest yet most compelling comeback stories.\n\n“I got started doing this work to make sure that there would always be a school for my kids,” Amy told the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority. “Now all my kids have graduated, but there’s still so much work to do.”\n\nFrom abandoned lots to anchored lives\n\nHousing was the flashpoint. By the late 2000s, Kit Carson had a stark shortage of livable homes, and school leaders warned that the district’s future was at risk. KCRD responded by acquiring, abating, and transforming blighted properties. That meant building or renovating homes designed not for profit, but for people.\n\nThrough partnerships with groups like Prairie Development Corporation and support from HUD, DOLA, and CDPHE, the nonprofit has now built 19 affordable homes and renovated another four. Some are rentals; most are now owned by the families who moved in. In a town where construction costs routinely exceed property values, Amy’s team sold homes for as little as half of what they cost to build simply because that’s what the community needed.\n\nOne moment made it all feel real: “Several years ago, my daughter, while working on a grant for KCRD, calculated that over 20 percent of Kit Carson School’s population had lived in the homes we helped develop,” Amy shared with The Optimist Daily. “It was a full circle moment for me.”\n\nIn Kit Carson, four new homes can mean four families who stay, a school that remains open, and a community that keeps beating.\n\nInfrastructure, economy, and identity\n\nBut KCRD’s vision goes beyond housing. Under Amy’s leadership, the nonprofit has cleaned up a large brownfield site, turned a vacant building into a commercial space with a grocery store and community mural, and opened The Hub, a multi-use space with coworking areas, leasable storefronts, and even a Tesla Supercharging station.\n\nWith just one city worker and one clerk, Kit Carson isn’t built for bureaucracy, but Amy and her team navigate complex grants, compliance requirements, and layered restrictions, all while delivering real change.\n\n“Rural America just needs houses,” she says. “We’re never going to attract a developer here. We rely on grants and belief.”\n\nAnd that belief is spreading. Since 2006, KCRD has leveraged over $5 million in grants and in-kind contributions to support its work.\n\nWhy Amy’s work matters\n\nIn Kit Carson, homes aren’t just structures. They’re a lifeline for teachers, grocery store clerks, and families who want to stay.\n\nAmy’s work is tailored for rural realities. KCRD builds where traditional developers won’t go and creates affordability in a market where the need far outweighs demand.\n\nIt’s a transformation of place and identity. Blight becomes beauty. Emptiness becomes energy. Decline becomes possibility.\n\nAnd it’s deeply human. “It’s all about the people,” Amy says. “They are the ones who see the work you’re doing. Then they believe in you. Then they trust you. Then they invest more in you. That’s transformational.”\n\nStill fighting. Still rooted.\n\nToday, KCRD continues to grow despite the cost, complexity, and challenges that come with rural development. Amy says the work isn’t glamorous; it’s “plumbing, broadband, local ownership, and the willingness to stay in the fight.”\n\nHer work has earned recognition locally and statewide. In 2022, she received the Good Scout Recognition at Kit Carson Days. But her motivation remains personal, local, and persistent: “Kit Carson is a great community full of amazing folks,” she says. “I don’t want to just see it survive—I want it to thrive.”\n\nAnd thanks to her and those she’s rallied behind her, it just might.\n\nLearn more about KCRD and how to support their work here.\n\nGive them a follow on Instagram and Facebook for the latest updates.",

      "summary": "MEPs achieved increases for the 2026 EU budget and secured funds for Horizon Europe, transport and energy networks, civil protection and agriculture.Committee on Budgets Source : © European Union, 2025 - EP",
      "content": "On Saturday morning, negotiators from the European Parliament and the Council reached a provisional agreement on the 2026 EU Budget, before the deadline of the conciliation period.\n\nNegotiators agreed to set the overall level of commitment appropriations for 2026 (legal promises to pay in the same year or later) at €192.8 billion, and payment appropriations (actual payments made to beneficiaries) at €190.1 billion. The provisional agreement restores €1.3 billion cut by EU governments to the levels originally proposed by the Commission on commitment appropriations.\n\nParliament secured additional funding for key EU programmes\n\nParliament successfully negotiated an additional €372.7 million in funding beyond the Commission's initial proposal, focusing on programmes and policies aimed at improving people's lives, boosting competitiveness, and addressing defence challenges. Detailed figures will be available in due course.\n\nResearch and infrastructure\n\nMEPs secured an increase of allocations for Horizon Europe by €20 million and transport and energy networks by €23.5 million in order to boost competitiveness, job-creation and cross-border infrastructure. MEPs strengthened support for education by adding €3 million to the Erasmus+ programme.\n\nAgriculture and environment\n\nThe EU’s environment and climate action instrument, the LIFE programme, will receive an additional €10 million in funding, while the EU4Health programme will benefit from a further €3 million. In line with Parliament's priorities, and to create new opportunities, particularly for young farmers, funding for measures promoting European agricultural products under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund has been increased by €105 million. This increase was made possible by higher-than-expected revenue and carried-over funds.\n\nResponse capabilities and military mobility\n\nParliament secured an additional €10 million to the Civil Protection Mechanism and RescEU to improve coordination and disaster response in light of the increasing frequency of natural disasters. Playing an essential role in the EU’s defence preparedness, military mobility gets an additional €10 million funding. MEPs also ensured that border management will be reinforced with an additional €10 million.\n\nGeopolitical instability, global crises\n\nParliament pushed for an additional €35 million for the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood, and a €25 million increase for the Eastern Neighbourhood. It also secured a €35 million increase in humanitarian aid, in response to growing geopolitical instability, accelerating global humanitarian crises, and climate change-induced emergencies.\n\nRepayment costs for the NextGenerationEU recovery package\n\nThe EU faces an unexpected €4.2 billion overrun in borrowing costs for NextGenerationEU in 2026, double the Commission’s forecast. MEPs guaranteed that should not reduce funding for essential programmes like Erasmus+ or EU4health and reversed some of the cuts made by EU governments to the original amounts estimated by the Commission. The overrun costs are dealt with as agreed previously in the “cascade mechanism”, designed to manage the reimbursement of escalating NextGenerationEU borrowing costs and to protect flagship programmes.\n\nQuotes\n\n“At the heart of the EU budget are the needs of its citizens: prosperity, security and solidarity. The EU delivers on research, border security, military mobility, cybersecurity and Erasmus+, while working to strengthen our single market. We live in turbulent times, with rising expectations and increasing demands on the EU budget. As citizens' priorities evolve, it's essential for the Parliament and EU institutions to listen and respond effectively. Progress is being made, but the budget alone will only get us so far. Continued effort and further steps will be needed to enhance competitiveness,” chair of the Committee on Budgets, Johan Van Overtveldt (ECR, BE) said.\n\n“Thanks to a strong European Parliament position and broad support across political groups, we secured an agreement on key priorities. This includes enhanced security for our citizens, in particular reinforced border management and military mobility, strengthened food security and health, and new opportunities for businesses, farmers, and young people, with additional support for Horizon Europe research initiatives, the promotion of agricultural products, and a strengthened Erasmus+ programme,” general rapporteur for the EU’s 2026 budget (for section III - Commission), Andrzej Halicki (EPP, PL), said.\n\n“I welcome today’s budgetary agreement, which is firmly grounded in Parliament’s priorities and strengthens Europe’s capacity to act. By increasing support for cybersecurity and the rule of law, we equip key EU institutions with greater resilience and accountability, while safeguarding our shared values. This budget also shows that we remain attentive to citizens’ needs and committed to ensuring that the Union functions efficiently,” rapporteur for the other sections, Matjaž Nemec (S&D, SI) said.\n\nNext steps\n\nOnce the Council formally adopts the compromise, it will be discussed in the Committee on Budgets next Thursday (20 November), then voted on in plenary in the European Parliament (during the November session in Strasbourg) and signed into law by its President.\n\nBackground\n\nMore than 93% of the EU budget goes directly into EU programmes that support people and projects across member states. The annual EU budget, which serves 27 countries and 450 million Europeans, is relatively small – on average €160-200 billion during 2021-27. This is comparable to the national budget of Poland, which serves 39 million people, or the equivalent of 30% of the budget of Germany, which serves 84 million people. (Source: Commission)",

      "title": "Science finally solves a 700-year-old royal murder",
      "summary": "Genetic, isotopic, and forensic evidence has conclusively identified the remains of Duke Béla of Macsó and uncovered remarkable details about his life, ancestry, and violent death. The study reveals a young nobleman with Scandinavian-Rurik roots who was killed in a coordinated, emotionally charged attack in 1272.",
      "content": "An international team led by Hungarian scholars has successfully confirmed that skeletal remains discovered in Budapest belong to Duke Béla, the Ban of Macsó, who descended from both the Árpád and Rurik dynasties. This finding resolves a long-standing archaeological mystery that has lingered for more than a century.\n\nThe project was organized by Tamás Hajdu (Department of Anthropology, Faculty of Sciences, Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE TTK)), with genetic analyses conducted by Anna Szécsényi-Nagy and Noémi Borbély of the Institute of Archaeogenomics, ELTE RCH. Their work demonstrates how historical accounts can be validated and violent deaths reconstructed in remarkable detail when the humanities and natural sciences collaborate. The study has been published in Forensic Science International: Genetics.\n\nEarly Discoveries on Margaret Island\n\nThe story began in 1915, when archaeologists excavating the Dominican monastery on Margaret Island (Budapest) uncovered the bones of a young man in the sacristy. Based on the burial context, period sources, and the evidence of trauma on the skeleton, researchers at the time suggested that the remains belonged to Béla Duke of Macsó, a member of the House of Árpád. Béla of Macsó (born after 1243 -- died: November 1272) was the grandson of King Béla IV on his mother's side, while his father's lineage traced back to the Rurik dynasty of northern, Scandinavian origin, which produced numerous Grand Dukes of Kiev from the 9th century onward. According to 13th-century Austrian chronicles, Duke Béla was assassinated in November 1272 by Ban Henrik \"Kőszegi\" of the Héder family and his associates. Contemporary stories describe how his mutilated body was collected by Margit (his sister) and Erzsébet (his niece) and buried at the Dominican monastery.\n\nLost Bones and a 20th-Century Disappearance\n\nAfter the excavation, the remains were sent to Lajos Bartucz at the Institute of Anthropology of the Budapest University (now: Department of Anthropology, ELTE TTK) for bioanthropological study. Bartucz documented 23 sword cuts across the skeleton, along with multiple fatal skull injuries. He concluded that the duke had been attacked by several individuals simultaneously and had even been struck while lying on the ground. Bartucz mentioned the bones publicly in 1936 and published a photograph of the skull in 1938. After that, all references to the remains disappeared, and many experts believed they had been lost during the Second World War. Unexpectedly, in 2018 the postcranial bones were rediscovered in a wooden box stored among tens of thousands of specimens in the Anthropology Collection of the Hungarian Museum of Natural History, while the skull continued to be curated in the Aurél Török Collection at ELTE.\n\nReopening the Case With Modern Science\n\nIn 2018, a new international research consortium was formed under the leadership of Tamás Hajdu (Department of Biological Anthropology, ELTE TTK). The group included anthropologists, geneticists, an archaeologist, an archaeobotanist, stable isotope specialists, radiocarbon experts, and dentists. Their objective was to verify the identity of the remains using modern forensic and bioarchaeological methods and to reconstruct as fully as possible the life and death of the duke.\n\nThe find holds exceptional historical value. Besides King Béla III, Béla of Macsó is the only confirmed member of the House of Árpád whose nearly complete skeleton is still preserved. This provides rare insight into both the genetic heritage of the Árpád dynasty and the Rurik line. Researchers from Vienna, Bologna, Helsinki, Harvard University, and multiple Hungarian institutions participated in the project.\n\nBiological Profile and Diet Insights\n\nAnthropological analysis showed that the man buried beneath the monastery floor on Margaret Island was in his early twenties. Radiocarbon dating was performed by two laboratories to ensure accuracy after early 14C measurements suggested a date slightly earlier than expected (second half of the 13th century). Additional tests by the Nuclear Research Institute (Debrecen) revealed that the unexpectedly early date was caused by dietary habits. The individual had consumed high amounts of animal protein, including fish and possibly shellfish that fed on ancient carbon sources, creating a known \"reservoir\" effect in the bones.\n\nThe team also examined dental calculus to further reconstruct his diet. More than a thousand microfossils were recovered from the tartar. Starch grains from wheat and barley, along with clear signs of milling, cooking, and baking, indicated that his meals included cooked wheat semolina and baked wheat bread.\n\nStrontium isotope analysis, which helps determine where a person lived during different stages of life, showed that the individual did not grow up in the same place where he was buried. His early childhood isotope signatures match those found in the region of Vukovar and Syrmia (now part of Croatia and Serbia; earlier this region was a part of the Macso Banat of the Medieval Kingdom of Hungary), as well as other parts of the Carpathian Basin. Later in childhood he moved to a different area, possibly near modern Budapest.\n\nGenetic Evidence Links the Skeleton to Royal Lineages\n\nThe final confirmation of identity was carried out at the Institute of Archaeogenomics of ELTE RCH by Anna Szécsényi-Nagy and Noémi Borbély. Multiple lines of genetic evidence supported the genealogical connections described in historical documents. The results show that Béla of Macsó was the great-grandson (fourth-degree descendant) of King Béla III, and his genetic distance to Saint Ladislaus fits this expected lineage pattern.\n\nGenome-wide analysis revealed that the duke had a strong Scandinavian genetic component (almost half), significant Eastern Mediterranean ancestry, and a smaller early medieval Central European component. The Scandinavian contribution supports his descent from the Rurik dynasty, while the Eastern Mediterranean component may correspond to his maternal grandmother, Maria Laskarina, a member of the Byzantine imperial family and wife of Béla IV. Y-chromosome results also confirm the historically documented Rurik paternal line. A 2023 Russian archaeogenomic study showed that a 13th-century Rurikid (Dmitry Alexandrovich) belonged to the same paternal lineage, which can be traced back to Yaroslav I (Yaroslav Vladimirovich, also known as Yaroslav the Wise). Genetic data from present-day Rurikid descendants further reinforces this connection.\n\nReconstructing a Coordinated and Brutal Assassination\n\nTo understand how Béla died and to compare the evidence with medieval accounts, the team conducted a detailed forensic anthropological investigation. The analysis documented 26 perimortem injuries, including nine to the skull and 17 to the rest of the body, all inflicted during a single violent attack. The pattern of wounds suggests that three assailants took part: one confronted him from the front while the others struck from the left and right.\n\nThe wounds show that Béla recognized the attack and tried to defend himself. Two types of weapons were likely used, probably a sabre and a longsword. The depth and clarity of the cuts indicate that he wore no armor when he was killed. The reconstructed sequence of violence begins with strikes to the head and upper body, followed by severe defensive injuries as he attempted to block further blows. He was ultimately incapacitated by strikes from the side, and once he fell to the ground, the attackers delivered fatal blows to his head and face. The number and intensity of these injuries point to strong emotional motivation (e.g. sudden anger, hatred), while the coordinated nature of the attack suggests planning. Although Duke Béla's assassination in November 1272 appears to have been partly or wholly premeditated, the manner of the killing indicates that it was not carried out calmly.\n\nResearchers and institutions participating in the research project:",

The Slovenian education system is relatively successful at all levels of education compared to the EU. In 2023, the share of both secondary school students and university students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics has increased, exceeding the European average.\n\nThe share of students in secondary vocational and professional education and training enrolled in programs in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics was 42.1 percent in 2023, significantly above the EU average (26.9 percent) and close to the proposed target for 2030. The share of students enrolled in programs in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics increased by 0.4 percentage points, while in the EU, it stagnated on average between 2015 and 2023.\n\nIn 2024, women represented about one-third of students enrolled in programs in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics at the tertiary level, which is very close to the EU average but below the proposed EU target. Among students in secondary vocational and professional education and training enrolled in programs in this field, there were less than one-sixth women.\n\nIn the field of preschool education and care, Slovenia provides a place for every child from a very early age (11 months), often immediately after the end of parental leave. Thus, it is one of the few EU countries without a shortage of places in preschool education and care.\n\nThe European Commission highlights the decline in basic skills among students and insufficient digital skills, as well as a lack of teachers, as challenges in school education. All of this poses a risk to the development of human capital. Comprehensive reforms of curricula are being implemented at the preschool, primary, and secondary school levels, and a new mandatory subject in computer science and digital technologies will be introduced in primary schools.
