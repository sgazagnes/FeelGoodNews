      "summary": "Cancer doesn’t evolve by pure chaos. Scientists have developed a powerful new method that reveals the hidden rules guiding how cancer cells gain and lose whole chromosomes—massive genetic shifts that help tumors grow, adapt, and survive treatment. By tracking thousands of individual cells over time, the approach shows which chromosome combinations give cancer an edge and why some tumors become especially resilient.",
      "content": "Key Highlights\n\nScientists have created a new way to predict how cancer cells evolve as they gain or lose entire chromosomes.\n\nThese large chromosome changes can quickly reshape tumors, helping them grow, adapt to stress, and resist treatment.\n\nA new tool called ALFA-K reveals which chromosome changes help cancer cells thrive and which ones hold them back.\n\nThe research shows how copying an entire genome can protect cancer cells from the damage caused by extreme chromosomal instability.\n\nThe findings open the door to evolution-aware cancer treatments that anticipate how tumors change rather than reacting after resistance appears.\n\nA New Way to Predict Cancer Evolution\n\nScientists at Moffitt Cancer Center have created a new method to forecast how cancer cells evolve as they gain or lose entire chromosomes. These large-scale genetic changes can give tumors an advantage, helping them grow faster, adapt to stress, and resist treatment.\n\nThe research, published in Nature Communications, introduces a computational tool called ALFA-K. It analyzes longitudinal, single-cell data to trace how cancer cells move through different chromosome combinations over time. By doing this, the method identifies which chromosome patterns are favored as tumors evolve.\n\nThe results challenge the idea that cancer evolution is driven by chance alone. Instead, the study shows that tumors follow measurable patterns shaped by chromosome makeup, evolutionary pressures, and treatment-related stress. This framework offers a new way to anticipate how cancers change and how they may respond to therapy.\n\nQ&A with Noemi Andor, Ph.D., corresponding author and associate member in the Integrated Mathematical Oncology Program at Moffitt.\n\nWhat problem were you trying to solve with this research, and why does it matter for understanding cancer?\n\nCancer evolves. As tumors grow, their cells constantly make mistakes when copying and dividing their DNA. Many of those mistakes involve gaining or losing whole chromosomes. This creates a mix of cancer cells with different chromosome combinations inside the same tumor.\n\nThe problem was that researchers had no reliable way to determine which of those combinations help cancer cells survive. The number of possible chromosome states is enormous, and most existing approaches could only capture snapshots in time or average behavior across many cells.\n\nALFA-K was developed to solve this problem by using longitudinal, single-cell data to reconstruct how cancer cells move through chromosome states over time and which states are favored by evolution. Without that understanding, cancer progression and treatment resistance can appear unpredictable. Our work shows they follow measurable rules.\n\nWhy are chromosome changes so important for tumor growth and treatment response?\n\nChromosomes contain hundreds or thousands of genes. When a cancer cell gains or loses a chromosome, it changes the dosage of many genes at once. This can immediately alter how the cell grows, divides or responds to stress.\n\nThese changes allow cancer cells to make large evolutionary jumps rather than small adjustments. They also create diversity within a tumor, which increases the chances that some cells survive treatment.\n\nImportantly, the effects of these changes depend on a cell's existing chromosome makeup. The same chromosome change can be helpful in one context and harmful in another. This context dependence helps explain why cancer evolution has been so difficult to predict.\n\nHow is ALFA-K different from previous tools, and what does it allow researchers to do?\n\nBefore ALFA-K, chromosome changes were often assumed to have fixed effects. Researchers sometimes treated gaining or losing a chromosome as always beneficial or always harmful. Real cancer evolution is more complex.\n\nALFA-K tracks thousands of individual cells over time, accounting for ongoing chromosome instability and reconstructs local fitness landscapes. These landscapes describe how advantageous or harmful a chromosome change is given a cell's current chromosome configuration.\n\nThe tool also shows that the rate of chromosome errors matters. When chemotherapy increases chromosome mis-segregation, cancer cells move across these landscapes more quickly. Depending on the landscape's shape, this can push tumors toward chromosome states that are more tolerant of instability.\n\nIn this study, ALFA-K estimated the fitness of more than 270,000 distinct chromosome configurations. This made it possible to ask questions that were previously inaccessible.\n\nWhat does whole-genome doubling mean, and why is it an important finding?\n\nWhole-genome doubling occurs when a cell copies all of its chromosomes. Previous research showed that this can help cancer cells survive, but there was no way to measure how much protection it provides.\n\nALFA-K allows researchers to quantify that buffering effect. The method measures how much more tolerant genome-doubled cells are to chromosome mistakes compared with non-doubled cells.\n\nThis matters because buffering is not all or nothing. There is a threshold at which genome doubling becomes advantageous. By quantifying that threshold, ALFA-K turns genome doubling from a descriptive observation into a predictable evolutionary event.\n\nHow could this research eventually help guide cancer treatment?\n\nALFA-K shifts cancer research from describing what tumors look like to predicting how they will evolve.\n\nIn the future, this approach could help doctors interpret repeat biopsies, identify when a tumor is approaching a dangerous evolutionary transition and choose treatments that limit cancer's ability to explore harmful chromosome configurations.\n\nThe long-term goal is evolution-aware cancer therapy. This approach aims to anticipate how tumors will change rather than reacting after resistance has already emerged.\n\nThis study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (1R37CA266727-01A1, 1R21CA269415-01A1, 1R03CA259873-01A1).",

By analyzing data from large populations in Denmark and the U.K., researchers found strong evidence that higher body weight can damage brain health over time, especially when it leads to elevated blood pressure. Much of the dementia risk appeared to be tied to vascular damage in the brain, which affects blood flow and cognitive function.",
      "content": "People who have obesity and high blood pressure may be more likely to develop dementia, according to new research published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.\n\nDementia is an increasing global public health concern, and there is currently no cure. People affected by the condition experience a serious decline in mental abilities, including memory, thinking, and reasoning, which can significantly interfere with daily life.\n\nWhat Dementia Is and How It Progresses\n\nDementia refers to a group of brain disorders rather than a single disease. The most common forms are Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia. These conditions gradually damage nerve cells in the brain, and symptoms worsen over time. As the disease progresses, people may struggle with memory, language, problem-solving, and changes in behavior.\n\nStudy Finds Direct Causes of Dementia\n\n\"In this study, we found high body mass index (BMI) and high blood pressure are direct causes of dementia,\" said study author Ruth Frikke-Schmidt, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Chief Physician at Copenhagen University Hospital -- Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark. \"The treatment and prevention of elevated BMI and high blood pressure represent an unexploited opportunity for dementia prevention.\"\n\nTo reach these conclusions, researchers analyzed data from participants in Copenhagen and the U.K. Their findings showed that higher body weight is not simply associated with dementia but plays a causal role in its development.\n\nHow Genetic Data Helped Establish Cause and Effect\n\nThe researchers were able to demonstrate a direct link between high BMI and dementia by using a Mendelian randomization study design, which closely resembles a randomized controlled trial. In this approach, common genetic variants that lead to higher BMI are used as stand-ins for BMI altering medications.\n\nIn drug trials, participants are randomly assigned to receive either an active treatment or a placebo. Similarly, genetic variants that increase BMI and those that do not are randomly passed from parents to children. Because this process is random, it allows scientists to see how BMI affects disease outcomes without interference from other factors that can cloud results.\n\nThis method enabled the research team to clearly identify high BMI as a direct cause of increased dementia risk.\n\nBlood Pressure Plays a Key Role\n\nThe analysis also revealed that much of the elevated dementia risk linked to obesity appears to be driven by high blood pressure. This finding suggests that preventing or treating both obesity and hypertension could lower the risk of developing dementia later in life.\n\n\"This study shows that high body weight and high blood pressure are not just warning signs, but direct causes of dementia,\" Frikke-Schmidt said. \"That makes them highly actionable targets for prevention.\"\n\nImplications for Early Prevention\n\nResearchers noted that weight-loss medications have already been tested in people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, but these treatments did not slow cognitive decline once symptoms had begun. However, the timing of intervention may be critical.\n\n\"Weight-loss medication has recently been tested for halting cognitive decline in early phases of Alzheimer's disease, but with no beneficial effect. An open question that remains to be tested is if weight-loss medication initiated before the appearance of cognitive symptoms may be protective against dementia. Our present data would suggest that early weight-loss interventions would prevent dementia, and especially vascular-related dementia,\" she continued.\n\nStudy Authors and Funding Sources\n\nOther study authors include Liv Tybjærg Nordestgaard of Copenhagen University Hospital -- Rigshospitalet and the University of Bristol in Bristol, England; Jiao Luo, Frida Emanuelsson, and Mette Christoffersen of Copenhagen University Hospital -- Rigshospitalet; Genevieve Leyden, Eleanor Sanderson, and George Davey Smith of the University of Bristol; Børge Nordestgaard and Shoaib Afzal of Copenhagen University Hospital - Herlev Gentofte and the University of Copenhagen; and Marianne Benn and Anne Tybjærg-Hansen of Copenhagen University Hospital -- Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen.\n\nThe study was funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark, the Capital Region of Denmark, the Lundbeck Foundation, Hjerteforeningen, and Sygeforsikringen Danmark.\n\nThe paper, titled \"High Body Mass Index as a Causal Risk Factor for Vascular-related Dementia a Mendelian Randomization Study,\" was published online ahead of print.",

      "summary": "A 5,500-year-old skeleton from Colombia has revealed the oldest known genome of the bacterium linked to syphilis and related diseases. The ancient strain doesn’t fit neatly into modern categories, hinting at a forgotten form that split off early in the pathogen’s evolution. This pushes the history of treponemal diseases in the Americas back by millennia and shows they were already diversifying long before written records.",
      "content": "Scientists have successfully reconstructed the genome of Treponema pallidum from human remains that are about 5,500 years old, discovered in the Sabana de Bogotá region of Colombia. This bacterium is responsible for several serious infectious diseases today, including syphilis. The findings, published in the journal Science, significantly expand what researchers know about how long these infections have affected human populations.\n\nThe remains were excavated from a rock shelter near present-day Bogotá and date back roughly 5,500 years. By identifying this ancient genome, researchers have extended the known genetic history of Treponema pallidum by more than 3,000 years. The evidence adds weight to the idea that treponemal diseases have circulated in the Americas far earlier than previously documented.\n\n\"Our findings show the unique potential of paleogenomics to contribute to our understanding of the evolution of species, and potential health risks for past and present communities,\" said geneticist Lars Fehren-Schmitz at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nWhat Are Treponemal Diseases?\n\nTreponema pallidum is a spiral-shaped bacterium that exists today in three closely related subspecies. Each causes a different disease: syphilis, yaws, and bejel. A fourth treponemal disease, pinta, is caused by Treponema carateum or Treponema pallidum subsp. carateum. No complete genome of the pathogen responsible for pinta has yet been recovered, which leaves questions about its evolutionary relationships and classification.\n\nDespite their nearly identical genetic makeup, scientists still do not know when or how these different disease forms emerged. While skeletal remains can sometimes show signs of infection, genetics often tell a more complex story. Large gaps remain between what bones can reveal and what ancient DNA can confirm about disease evolution.\n\nA Lost Lineage of a Familiar Pathogen\n\nIn this study, researchers confirmed that the ancient DNA belonged to the species Treponema pallidum, but it did not match any of the known forms that cause disease today. Although closely related to modern strains, the ancient genome split off early in the bacterium's evolutionary history.\n\n\"One possibility is that we uncovered an ancient form of the pathogen that causes pinta, which we know little about, but is known to be endemic in Central to South America and causes symptoms localized to the skin,\" said Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas at the University of Lausanne and group leader at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. \"At this time, we cannot prove this is the case, but it is a lead worth investigating further.\"\n\nBased on genetic analysis, scientists estimate that this ancient strain separated from other T. pallidum lineages about 13,700 years ago. In contrast, the three modern subspecies appear to have diverged much later, around 6,000 years ago. These timelines support earlier research and highlight how diverse treponemal pathogens were in the distant past.\n\n\"Current genomic evidence, along with our genome presented here, does not resolve the long-standing debate about where the disease syndromes themselves originated, but it does show there's this long evolutionary history of treponemal pathogens that was already diversifying in the Americas thousands of years earlier than previously known,\" said Elizabeth Nelson, a molecular anthropologist and paleopathologist at SMU.\n\nA Genetic Puzzle With Modern Implications\n\nTracing the origins of treponemal diseases is especially challenging because the bacteria are extremely similar at the genetic level. At the same time, they spread in different ways and can cause very different symptoms, making their evolutionary paths difficult to untangle.\n\n\"Our results push back the association of T. pallidum with humans by thousands of years, possibly more than 10,000 years ago in the Late Pleistocene,\" said researcher Davide Bozzi at the University of Lausanne and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.\n\nThe discovery builds on long-term archaeological and genetic work at the Tequendama 1 site. Earlier studies by archaeologist Miguel Delgado of the Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Argentina and Fehren-Schmitz provided detailed background on the skeleton itself.\n\nAn Unexpected Find in Massive DNA Data\n\nThe pathogen was not discovered intentionally at first. Researchers originally sequenced the individual's DNA to study ancient human population history, producing about 1.5 billion fragments of genetic data, far more than is typical. During routine screening, teams at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the University of Lausanne independently detected traces of T. pallidum and decided to investigate together.\n\nAlthough bacterial DNA made up only a tiny portion of the total genetic material, the depth of sequencing allowed the team to reconstruct the pathogen's genome without using specialized enrichment techniques.\n\nThe diseases caused by T. pallidum (bejel, yaws, and syphilis) can leave marks on bones, but only under certain conditions and not in all infected individuals. Most ancient genomes of this bacterium have been recovered from teeth or bones that clearly showed signs of disease. In this case, the skeleton showed no visible evidence of infection. Researchers sampled a tibia, or shin bone, which is not commonly used for ancient DNA studies. The success of this approach suggests that even bones without obvious disease markers can preserve valuable genetic information.\n\nWhy Ancient Disease History Matters Today\n\nBy learning how infectious diseases emerged and changed in the past, scientists hope to better anticipate how they might evolve in the future. This knowledge could help modern societies prepare for potential health threats.\n\nBefore publishing the results, the research team shared their findings with communities in Colombia, recognizing the discovery's importance to the country's medical history. They consulted local scholars, students, and community members, and engaged with stakeholders through presentations and interviews. All required permits for export and study were obtained.\n\n\"This process was essential because the findings are deeply connected to Colombia's medical and cultural history,\" said Delgado. \"Engaging scholars, students, and Indigenous and non-Indigenous community members ensures the results are ethically communicated and interpreted in partnership with local communities. This approach builds trust, supports responsible stewardship of sensitive discoveries, and reinforces local ownership of knowledge.\"\n\nAn International Collaboration\n\nIn addition to Nelson, Bozzi, Malaspinas, Delgado, and Fehren-Schmitz, the research was co-led by Nasreen Broomandkhoshbacht, now at the University of Vermont. The broader team included Kalina Kassadjikova of the University of California, Santa Cruz; Jane Buikstra of Arizona State University; Carlos Eduardo G. Amorim of California State University, Northridge; Melissa Estrada Pratt of the Instituto Colombiano de Antropología e Historia in Bogotá, Colombia; Gilbert Greub of the University of Lausanne and Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland; Nicolas Rascovan of the Institut Pasteur in Paris; and David Šmajs of Masaryk University in the Czech Republic.",

Now, scientists have built a strip that changes colour according to levels of this hormone, which is present in period blood, into a menstrual pad\n\nMenstrual pads can non-invasively collect information on a woman’s fertility Shutterstock/Connect world\n\nAn at-home test built into a menstrual pad could help women track their fertility using their period blood, offering a non-invasive way to monitor changes over time, without the need for repeated blood tests or clinic visits.\n\nFor many women, their fertility remains a mystery until they try to conceive. If they encounter difficulties, clinical tests can offer insights.\n\nThese tests can measure levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a common marker of “ovarian reserve” – a rough indication of the number of eggs remaining. In adults, AMH levels decline with age, so high levels indicate a plentiful egg supply. A below-average level can signal a diminished egg reserve or early menopause.\n\nTraditionally, AMH is measured using a blood test in the clinic or via a finger-prick test at home. In both cases, the sample must be sent to a lab for processing before results are returned.\n\nNow, Lucas Dosnon at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and his colleagues have developed an easy-to-use test that provides immediate results using menstrual blood.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThe test is a lateral flow assay (similar to a covid-19 test) that uses tiny, gold-coated particles covered with antibodies that bind specifically to AMH. When the test is dipped in menstrual blood, the interaction of the hormone and particles creates a visible line on the test strip. The darker the line, the higher the AMH.\n\nAlthough the results can be estimated by eye, the researchers have trained a smartphone app to analyse a photograph of the test strip to provide a more precise reading. When they used their approach to test menstrual blood containing known concentrations of AMH, the results closely matched those obtained from lab-based tests.\n\nThe team has also integrated the test into a menstrual pad, which would allow AMH levels to be measured passively during a period. This could provide meaningful insights into ovarian reserve over time, potentially revealing trends that would be missed by a single test.\n\n“We believe that this work could be transformative for women’s health,” says Dosnon, who suggests the test could enable frequent screening of ovarian health for many purposes, including during IVF or for the detection of fertility conditions other than declining ovarian reserve. High AMH levels, for example, are associated with polycystic ovary syndrome and, in rare cases, granulosa cell tumours, which affect the ovaries. “Menstrual blood is an underutilised resource that actually holds a lot of promises for health monitoring as a whole,” says Dosnon.\n\nRichard Anderson at the University of Edinburgh, UK, points out that clinical interpretation is a challenge with any kind of home medical test, because analysing the results isn’t always straightforward, and that no AMH test can tell you about the quality of eggs. He also wonders whether women would choose this test over established ones. “Is getting a reliable blood test such a burden?” he asks.\n\nIn response, Dosnon says the test isn’t intended to replace clinical lab tests, but rather to offer an alternative that addresses some of the challenges faced in women’s health monitoring and research, thanks to its non-invasiveness, ease of use and low cost.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Women’s fertility depends partly on a hormone called anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which shows how many eggs a woman has left. Usually, AMH is measured with blood tests at clinics or by sending finger-prick samples to labs.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists in Switzerland created a test strip that changes color based on AMH levels in menstrual blood. This strip is built into a menstrual pad, so women can check their fertility hormone during their period without needles or lab visits. A smartphone app can read the test strip for more exact results.\n\n**Impact** – This new test makes it easier and less invasive for women to monitor their ovarian reserve regularly. It can also help detect conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome or early menopause. Tracking AMH over time could give better insights than one single test, helping women understand their fertility health more clearly.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers plan to further develop and test this menstrual pad to make it widely available. It could become a common tool for women to check fertility at home, complementing traditional blood tests rather than replacing them.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have developed a menstrual pad with a built-in test that lets women easily check their fertility hormone levels using period blood at home.\n",
