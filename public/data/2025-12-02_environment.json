      "title": "New graphene breakthrough supercharges energy storage",
      "summary": "Engineers have unlocked a new class of supercapacitor material that could rival traditional batteries in energy while charging dramatically faster. By redesigning carbon structures into highly curved, accessible graphene networks, the team achieved record energy and power densities—enough to reshape electric transport, stabilize power grids, and supercharge consumer electronics.",
      "content": "Engineers have achieved a significant advance in the international effort to create energy storage technologies that combine rapid charging with strong power output, paving the way for next-generation systems in electric transportation, grid support and everyday electronics.\n\nAccording to findings published in Nature Communications, the researchers have developed a new carbon-based material that enables supercapacitors to hold energy levels comparable to traditional lead-acid batteries while releasing that energy far more quickly than conventional battery designs.\n\nSupercapacitors are a developing category of energy storage devices that rely on electrostatic charge storage instead of the chemical reactions used in batteries. A long-standing challenge has been that only a small share of the carbon surface area needed for energy storage has been usable.\n\nUnlocking More of Carbon's Potential\n\nProfessor Mainak Majumder, Director of the ARC Research Hub for Advanced Manufacturing with 2D Materials (AM2D) in Monash's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, participated in the study.\n\n\"Our team has shown how to unlock much more of that surface area by simply changing the way the material is heat-treated,\" said Professor Majumder.\n\n\"This discovery could allow us to build fast-charging supercapacitors that store enough energy to replace batteries in many applications, and deliver it far more quickly.\"\n\nInnovative Graphene Architecture Drives the Breakthrough\n\nThe researchers traced this progress to a newly designed material architecture called multiscale reduced graphene oxide (M-rGO), created from natural graphite, an abundant resource in Australia.\n\nThrough a rapid thermal annealing process, the team formed a highly curved graphene structure with controlled pathways that allow ions to move with exceptional speed and efficiency. This produced a material capable of both high energy density and high power density, a combination that is rarely achieved in a single device.\n\nRecord Performance in Real Devices\n\nDr. Petar Jovanović, a research fellow in the ARC AM2D Hub and co-author of the study, explained that when incorporated into pouch cell devices, the Monash supercapacitors demonstrated:\n\nVolumetric energy densities of up to 99.5 Wh/L (in ionic liquid electrolytes)\n\nPower densities as high as 69.2 kW/L\n\nRapid charging capabilities with excellent cycle stability.\n\n\"These performance metrics are among the best ever reported for carbon-based supercapacitors, and crucially, the process is scalable and compatible with Australian raw materials,\" Dr. Jovanović said.\n\nMoving Toward Commercial Use\n\nDr. Phillip Aitchison, CTO of the Monash University spinout Ionic Industries and a co-author of the study, noted that efforts to commercialize the technology are already underway.\n\n\"Ionic Industries was established to commercialize innovations such as these and we are now making commercial quantities of these graphene materials,\" said Dr. Aitchison.\n\n\"We're working with energy storage partners to bring this breakthrough to market-led applications -- where both high energy and fast power delivery are essential.\"\n\nThe project received support from the Australian Research Council and the US Air Force Office of Sponsored Research and aligns with Monash University's broader goal of advancing materials for a low-carbon energy future.",

      "title": "A lost Amazon world just reappeared in Bolivia",
      "summary": "Researchers exploring Bolivia’s Great Tectonic Lakes discovered a landscape transformed over centuries by sophisticated engineering and diverse agricultural traditions. Excavations show how Indigenous societies adapted to dynamic wetlands through raised fields, canals, and mixed livelihoods. Today’s local communities preserve this biocultural continuity, guiding research and conservation.",
      "content": "In September 2021, a team of specialists traveled to one of the least-documented areas of the Bolivian Amazon: the Great Tectonic Lakes of Exaltación in the department of Beni. The expedition, organized by the Grupo de Trabajo para los Llanos de Moxos (GTLM), brought together experts from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the National Museum of Natural History, the Institute of Ecology, the Biodiversity and Environment Research Center, the Aquatic Resources Research Center, and the Department of Anthropology of the Americas at the University of Bonn.\n\nIn the southwestern Amazon, the tectonic Lakes Rogaguado and Ginebra reveal a landscape shaped by generations of human innovation. Beneath the open grasslands and shallow waters lie the remains of extensive earthworks, raised agricultural fields, and interconnected canals that reflect a long history of people adapting to a dynamic environment.\n\nThese lakes sit within the Municipal Protected Area of Grandes Lagos Tectónicos de Exaltación and form part of the Río Yata Ramsar wetland complex, which is recognized by UNESCO for both its ecological and cultural value. Set in the Llanos de Moxos, a vast network of savannas, gallery forests, and floodplains that make up the largest wetland system in the Amazon basin, this area has inspired curiosity for centuries. Ethnohistorical accounts even linked it to the legendary 'Land of Paititi.' Only recently has its deep human past begun to come into clearer view.\n\nMapping a Long History of Settlement\n\nUsing a combination of surveys, excavations, and LiDAR imaging, the research team documented several archaeological sites: Paquío, Coquinal, Isla del Tesoro, and Jasschaja. Each site represents a different stage in the long sequence of habitation across this region.\n\nRadiocarbon dates reveal repeated occupations from roughly 600 to 1400 CE. Findings at Paquío show an early settlement beginning around 600 CE, followed by a more intensive occupation between 1000 and 1200 CE. This later phase included shell middens, dense ceramic refuse, and a sophisticated system of canals and raised fields connected to maize-based farming. Jasschaja, which dates from 1300 to 1400 CE, reflects broader landscape alterations and greater botanical diversity, suggesting intensified forest and crop management during its occupation.\n\nInnovations in Water Management and Agriculture\n\nThe terrain of the Llanos de Moxos is filled with geometric forms that reveal themselves on closer inspection. Circular and rectangular ditches, drainage channels, raised planting platforms, and clusters of mounds create a complex network designed for water control and cultivation. These structures were built to regulate seasonal flooding, guide water flow, and create stable areas for living and farming within a wetland that changes dramatically throughout the year.\n\nTheir many shapes, ranging from geometric enclosures to long elevated fields, indicate that there was no single standardized design. Instead, they represent centuries of experimentation as communities responded to shifting ecological and social conditions. Together, these features highlight the cultural diversity and long-term resilience of the people who developed them.\n\nExcavations at Paquío and Jasschaja also revealed details about a varied pre-Hispanic diet that relied on wetland resources. Fish such as wolf fish, peacock bass, and South American lungfish were especially common, accompanied by reptiles including caimans and turtles, and mammals such as capybaras, pacas, and armadillos. Plant remains show the use of maize, legumes, and multiple palm species -- moriche palm, corozo palm, cumare palm, totai palm, palmita, and peach palm. Together, these remains point to a balanced subsistence strategy that combined fishing, hunting, gathering, and farming.\n\nBiocultural Knowledge and Indigenous Leadership\n\nThe Cayubaba and Movima communities continue to live in these landscapes, where rich biodiversity is deeply connected to cultural heritage. Their long-standing presence and environmental knowledge help maintain a unique form of biocultural heritage in which ecological and cultural diversity have developed side by side over many generations.\n\nDuring the post-Covid-19 field seasons, collaboration with local communities was rooted in open communication and mutual respect. Representatives of the Cayubaba Indigenous Council, which includes 21 Cayubaba and Movima communities, assisted researchers in identifying areas for study, providing access to culturally important places, and specifying sites that should not be disturbed. While interactions were limited for health reasons, this partnership ensured that the research reflected community priorities and contributed to a fuller understanding of the living heritage of the region.\n\nThrough the GTLM, Indigenous leaders and scientists are working together to link archaeological and ecological research with conservation initiatives. These efforts emphasize that the Llanos de Moxos is not only a center of biodiversity but also a landscape shaped through long human histories, and they support continued management of the Yata River Ramsar site and the protected areas connected to it.\n\nLessons From the Past for a Changing Amazon\n\nAs deforestation, expanding agriculture, and climate change put increasing pressure on the Amazon, the landscapes around Lakes Rogaguado and Ginebra highlight the importance of sustainable land-use traditions. Archaeological evidence shows that past communities developed flexible ways of living that combined farming, fishing, and forest management. Rather than seeking to control or overexploit the environment, they adapted to its seasonal cycles and used periodic flooding as an opportunity.\n\nAlthough raised-field agriculture eventually ended -- likely because of population decline and social upheaval after European colonization -- this does not diminish the effectiveness of these systems. For centuries, communities maintained productive landscapes by working with the region's natural rhythms. Their practices challenge modern assumptions about what counts as \"development\" and remind us that resilience often emerges from diversity: of species, of knowledge, and of cultural traditions.\n\nProtecting this biocultural heritage is now a global responsibility. The wetlands of the Llanos de Moxos continue to store carbon, moderate water systems, and support a wide range of species. Conservation efforts must also respect the people who have cared for these landscapes for generations. In this way, archaeology becomes more than a study of the past; it becomes a means of reconnecting ancient knowledge with today's urgent debates about sustainability and environmental justice.\n\nThe Llanos de Moxos demonstrate that the Amazon has always been a place where people and nature have shaped one another. Its monumental earthworks, forest islands, and living cultural traditions suggest that part of our shared future may depend on listening more closely to these landscapes that remember.",

      "content": "Subscribe to receive transcripts by email. Read along with this episode.\n\nAmericans dispose of approximately 1.3 billion gallons of used motor oil annually, but only about 800 million gallons get recycled, and most of that is burned as fuel rather than re-refined into new oil. The plastic packaging oil comes in is more problematic: most curbside programs won’t accept them because residual oil contaminates other recyclables. What happens when the companies that make motor oil embrace extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws that require recycling the oil and the containers it comes in? David Lawes, CEO of the Lubricants Packaging Management Association (LPMA), is leading what could become a national model for extended producer responsibility. Colorado just became the testing ground. In September 2024, five major oil companies—BP Lubricants, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, and Valvoline—founded LPMA as an independent producer responsibility organization.\n\nColorado gave producers a choice: join the Circular Action Alliance, which manages all packaging and printed paper recycling in the state, or develop their own sector-specific program that demonstrates better outcomes. LPMA chose the independent path, arguing that petroleum packaging requires specialized handling that general-purpose programs can’t provide efficiently. Lawes brings two decades of EPR policy experience to the role, including a decade regulating EPR programs in Canada. The program he ran in British Columbia achieves a 96% recycling rate for oil containers—compared to less than 1% in most U.S. states. “This is not about skirting the law or finding an easier pathway,” Lawes explains. “It is about meeting the same results in an industry-friendly way.”\n\nIf Colorado’s model works, it could reshape EPR programs nationwide. We discuss why petroleum packaging can’t be managed through curbside programs, what lessons from Canada’s more developed EPR system apply here, and whether the U.S. needs national recycling standards to harmonize the patchwork of state regulations.

      "personality_title": "Countries unite to propose global treaty for safer mining",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In February 2025, a dam burst at a Chinese copper mine in northern Zambia, releasing toxic waste into a river. This caused dead fish, polluted water, and health risks for local communities. Mining disasters like this threaten the environment and people's well-being.\n\n**What happened** – This week, during the United Nations Environment Assembly, Colombia led a group of countries proposing a new global treaty. The treaty would set rules to manage minerals and metals safely and prevent mining pollution. Countries like Armenia, Ecuador, Oman, and Zambia support this plan. The proposal includes creating a UN working group to explore strong rules that would hold mining companies accountable.\n\n**Impact** – This treaty idea is important because current laws, especially in the US and Europe, are becoming weaker. Voluntary actions by companies have not stopped pollution or human rights problems. The treaty aims to make mining safer worldwide by requiring clear tracking of minerals and care for the environment. It could stop disasters like the one in Zambia and protect millions of people and nature.\n\n**What's next step** – The UN working group will discuss whether to create binding rules that countries must follow or non-binding guidelines. Some countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia, oppose strict rules, so talks will be challenging. Still, if the treaty moves forward, it could lead to stronger global protections for mining.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new global treaty proposed at the UN aims to stop mining disasters and protect people and the environment by setting clear, enforceable rules for mining worldwide.",
      "personality_title_fr": "Des pays s’unissent pour proposer un traité mondial pour un extraction minière plus sûre",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – En février 2025, un barrage d’une mine de cuivre chinoise dans le nord de la Zambie a cédé, libérant des déchets toxiques dans une rivière. Cela a causé la mort de poissons, la pollution de l’eau et des risques pour la santé des communautés locales. Les catastrophes minières comme celle-ci menacent l’environnement et la vie des gens.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Cette semaine, lors de l’Assemblée des Nations Unies pour l’environnement, la Colombie a dirigé un groupe de pays proposant un nouveau traité mondial. Ce traité établirait des règles pour gérer les minéraux et métaux en toute sécurité et prévenir la pollution minière. Des pays comme l’Arménie, l’Équateur, Oman et la Zambie soutiennent ce projet. La proposition inclut la création d’un groupe de travail de l’ONU pour étudier des règles fortes tenant les entreprises minières responsables.\n\n**Impact** – Cette idée de traité est importante car les lois actuelles, notamment aux États-Unis et en Europe, s’affaiblissent. Les actions volontaires des entreprises n’ont pas empêché la pollution ni les problèmes de droits humains. Le traité vise à rendre l’extraction minière plus sûre dans le monde entier en exigeant un suivi clair des minéraux et le respect de l’environnement. Il pourrait empêcher des catastrophes comme celle en Zambie et protéger des millions de personnes et la nature.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le groupe de travail de l’ONU discutera s’il faut créer des règles contraignantes que les pays doivent suivre ou des lignes directrices non contraignantes. Certains pays, dont l’Arabie saoudite, l’Iran et la Russie, s’opposent à des règles strictes, donc les négociations seront difficiles. Pourtant, si le traité avance, il pourrait renforcer la protection mondiale de l’extraction minière.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Un nouveau traité mondial proposé à l’ONU vise à arrêter les catastrophes minières et à protéger les populations et l’environnement en établissant des règles claires et applicables pour l’extraction minière dans le monde entier.",
      "personality_title_es": "Países se unen para proponer un tratado global para una minería más segura",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – En febrero de 2025, una presa en una mina de cobre china en el norte de Zambia se rompió, liberando desechos tóxicos en un río. Esto causó la muerte de peces, contaminación del agua y riesgos para la salud de las comunidades locales. Los desastres mineros como este amenazan el medio ambiente y la vida de las personas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Esta semana, durante la Asamblea de las Naciones Unidas para el Medio Ambiente, Colombia lideró un grupo de países que propuso un nuevo tratado global. Este tratado establecería reglas para manejar minerales y metales de forma segura y prevenir la contaminación minera. Países como Armenia, Ecuador, Omán y Zambia apoyan esta iniciativa. La propuesta incluye crear un grupo de trabajo de la ONU para explorar reglas fuertes que obliguen a las empresas mineras a rendir cuentas.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta idea de tratado es importante porque las leyes actuales, especialmente en EE. UU. y Europa, se están debilitando. Las acciones voluntarias de las empresas no han detenido la contaminación ni los problemas de derechos humanos. El tratado busca hacer la minería más segura en todo el mundo exigiendo un seguimiento claro de los minerales y cuidado del medio ambiente. Podría evitar desastres como el de Zambia y proteger a millones de personas y la naturaleza.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El grupo de trabajo de la ONU discutirá si crear reglas vinculantes que los países deban seguir o directrices no vinculantes. Algunos países, incluyendo Arabia Saudita, Irán y Rusia, se oponen a reglas estrictas, por lo que las negociaciones serán difíciles. Sin embargo, si el tratado avanza, podría fortalecer las protecciones globales para la minería.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Un nuevo tratado global propuesto en la ONU busca detener desastres mineros y proteger a las personas y el medio ambiente mediante reglas claras y obligatorias para la minería en todo el mundo.",
