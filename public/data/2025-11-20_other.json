      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nAs Thanksgiving approaches, Manhattan is getting an unexpected gift: a pop-up apple orchard right in the heart of the city. And behind this sweet surprise is The Farmlink Project, a college-student-founded nonprofit that has become one of the most inspiring forces in food rescue today.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 25, The Farmlink Project and 260 Sample Sale will transform 261 Fifth Avenue into a cozy, cider-scented celebration of community. Starting at 11 a.m., anyone in the city can drop in and grab free, farm-fresh apples. All 20 thousand pounds. (enough apples for roughly four thousand families) come straight from Upstate New York orchards, thanks to the New York Apple Association.\n\n“Every day, tons of fresh, healthy food goes to waste while families go hungry,” said Eliza Blank, CEO of The Farmlink Project. “With the government shutdown disrupting food assistance, Farmlink is stepping up to close the gap—showing how simple it can be to turn surplus into sustenance.”\n\nBringing the orchard to the city\n\nInside 260 Sample Sale’s Fifth Avenue location, the organization will set the scene with warm cider, fall décor, and volunteers ready to share how Farmlink rescues surplus food from farms and delivers it to families in need nationwide. The goal is not only to spread seasonal cheer but also to spotlight a system that turns abundance into access.\n\nAlongside the twenty thousand pounds of apples being handed out to the public, Farmlink will donate an additional fifteen thousand pounds to food banks across New York City, including partners in Harlem, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. That’s thirty‑five thousand pounds of fresh fruit supporting families just as holiday grocery bills spike.\n\nA simple idea with a massive impact\n\nThe Farmlink Project began with a few college students during the early months of the pandemic. They saw two crises happening at once: farmers plowing under perfectly edible produce and millions of families struggling to afford food. Their solution was beautifully straightforward. To connect the farms that have too much with the communities that have too little.\n\nIn just a few years, the nonprofit has grown into one of the only national organizations moving millions of pounds of surplus produce each week. Today, Farmlink collaborates with more than 400 farms and food donors and over 500 hunger‑relief partners across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nEvery box of apples, carrots, lettuce, or tomatoes that Farmlink moves is a reminder that solving big problems sometimes starts with small, coordinated acts of care.\n\nA mission fueled by community\n\nIn September, Farmlink teamed up with Happier Grocery and distributed two thousand pounds of fresh produce to New Yorkers in just two and a half hours. This month’s pop-up orchard is part of the nonprofit’s push toward an ambitious goal: delivering 10 million pounds of food by Thanksgiving.\n\nThe event also includes support from Carhartt, which will be onsite selling limited-edition Carhartt x Farmlink hats and T-shirts. Proceeds go directly toward expanding Farmlink’s work, making it even easier for New Yorkers to help close the gap between surplus and scarcity.\n\nAn invitation to give and receive\n\nEveryone is welcome at the November 25 event. Admission is free, apples are free, and donations are encouraged but never required. Whether you stop by for cider, to grab a bag of apples, or simply to learn more about food rescue, your presence helps grow a movement rooted in generosity.\n\nAs Farmlink’s work shows, sometimes healing a broken food system starts with a single piece of fruit, shared with care, passed hand‑to‑hand, and offered with the belief that no abundance should ever go to waste.\n\nEvent details\n\nWhat: Free Apple Picking in NYC hosted by The Farmlink Project & 260 Sample Sale\n\nWhen: Tuesday, November 25, 11:00 a.m. until apples run out\n\nWhere: 260 Sample Sale, 261 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan\n\nAdmission: Free and open to the public (donations encouraged). Register here.\n\nTo learn more or get involved, visit farmlinkproject.org.\n\nMore organizations turning surplus into sustenance\n\nThe Farmlink Project is part of a much larger movement to ensure good food never goes to waste. Across the country, hundreds of groups work to harvest surplus produce, connect growers with food banks, and make fresh food accessible to families who need it. Here are a few national directories and organizations where readers can explore, volunteer, or get inspired:\n\nBackyard Bounty (Santa Barbara, CA)\n\nBackyard Bounty is a volunteer-powered gleaning program run by the Foodbank of Santa Barbara County. Since 2007, the program has rescued more than 1.5 million pounds of backyard and farm-grown fruit. They’ve saved everything from citrus and figs to avocados and guavas, and redirected it to local families in need. Homeowners can request a harvest, and volunteers of all ages can join picking days to help ensure good food never goes to waste. We had to mention this one since we are based in Santa Barbara! Learn more at foodbanksbc.org or on Instagram at @backyardbountysbc.\n\nNational Gleaning Project (U.S.)\n\nThe National Gleaning Project serves as one of the most comprehensive directories of gleaning and food rescue groups in the country. Their interactive map makes it easy to search by state or city and discover local organizations that harvest surplus produce and deliver it to communities in need. Whether you’re looking to volunteer, donate food, or start a gleaning program of your own, this is the place to begin. Explore the map and resources at nationalgleaningproject.org.\n\nAssociation of Gleaning Organizations (AGO)\n\nThe Association of Gleaning Organizations is a national network that connects and supports gleaning groups across the country. AGO provides training, shared resources, and community-building opportunities for nonprofits that rescue surplus produce and make fresh food accessible to those who need it most. Their member directory makes it easy to discover local gleaning efforts or join the movement if you’re ready to start one. Learn more at gleaningorgs.com.\n\nSociety of St. Andrew (SoSA)\n\nThe Society of St. Andrew is one of the longest-running gleaning organizations in the U.S., working with farmers and volunteers to rescue surplus crops and deliver them directly to hunger-relief partners. With active gleaning programs in multiple states, SoSA hosts community harvest days, coordinates farm pickups, and helps millions of pounds of fresh produce reach food banks each year. Their model makes it easy for anyone to join a harvest and make a tangible impact. Find a gleaning opportunity near you at endhunger.org.\n\nAmpleHarvest.org\n\nAmpleHarvest.org helps gardeners and growers donate extra fruits and vegetables directly to local food pantries. That means no middleman, no food waste. Their national registry lists thousands of pantries that accept fresh produce, making it easy to share homegrown abundance with families who need it. Whether you’re tending a backyard garden or managing a community plot, this tool turns surplus into immediate support. Search the database or register your pantry at AmpleHarvest.org.\n\nFood Forward (Los Angeles & beyond)\n\nFood Forward rescues fresh surplus produce from farms, backyards, and wholesale markets across California and reroutes it to hunger-relief organizations. Their work spans everything from backyard fruit picks to large-scale recoveries at the LA Wholesale Produce Market. Collectively, they recover millions of pounds of fruits and vegetables each year. Their Food Recovery Directory is also a widely used resource that lists dozens of regional food rescue and gleaning organizations across the U.S. Learn more or explore the directory at foodforward.org.\n\nVillage Harvest (California & national directory)\n\nVillage Harvest is a California-based nonprofit that brings volunteers together to harvest surplus fruit from neighborhood trees and small orchards, then distributes it to local food agencies. Alongside its hands-on gleaning work, Village Harvest also maintains a national directory of harvesting and gleaning programs, offering an invaluable resource for anyone looking to find or start a community fruit rescue effort. Explore volunteer opportunities or browse the directory at villageharvest.org.\n\nA growing movement\n\nWhether it’s Farmlink rerouting farm surplus, Backyard Bounty harvesting backyard citrus, or any of the hundreds of gleaning programs across the country, one thing is clear: food rescue is a community effort, and everyone has a part to play.\n\nIf you’re inspired by this work, start local. Check the directories above, look for a gleaning or food rescue organization in your area, or start one if none exist yet. And if you already volunteer with one of these programs, we want to hear from you!\n\nOptimists, email us (social@optimistdaily.com) or tell us on socials…\n\nWhat’s your favorite gleaning or food rescue group?\n\nDo you volunteer for one of these organizations?\n\nDid we miss a program we should know about?\n\nHave you grown fruit or vegetables you’ve donated before?\n\nThis movement works because people like you get involved. Spread the word, show up, and help make sure good food never ends up in the trash.",

      "content": "Iznik tiles are considered the pinnacle of Ottoman art and grace many of Turkey's most iconic monuments.\n\nFor over 300 years, the closely-guarded secrets of the Ottoman Empire's luminous tilework was lost, but its rediscovery has revived a key part of Turkey’s cultural heritage.\n\nRenowned for intricate designs and lustrous colours, Iznik tiles are considered the pinnacle of Ottoman art, gracing monuments such as Istanbul's Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace.\n\nThe tiles come from Iznik, a small town near Istanbul with a ceramics tradition spanning two millennia also known as Nicaea, which hosted a landmark Christian gathering in 325 AD that Pope Leo will celebrate when he visits this month.\n\nUnder the patronage of the Ottoman Empire, Iznik's artisans flourished, obtaining \"remarkable achievements\" by the mid-16th century, said Professor Ezgi Yalcinkaya, head of traditional Turkish arts at Usak University.\n\nThey developed a high-quartz stonepaste, known as fritware, yielding a bright white background ideal for decorating, transparent glazes and vibrant colours, including a \"coral red\" for floral designs which \"created a distinctive new style\", she told AFP.\n\nBut when the Ottoman Empire began to decline in the 17th century, the workshops started to close and the artisans, mainly Greeks and Armenians who knew the formula for the stonepaste, the colours and glazes, died off.\n\n\"Knowledge was passed entirely through master-apprentice relationships. The specific formulas – especially for the coral red and fritware composition – were oral secrets,\" she said.\n\n\"Without documentation, the expertise died with the last masters. By the 18th-19th centuries, the technical knowledge was largely lost.\"\n\nKerim Akbaygil of the Iznik Foundation says the tiles are no longer the preserve of palaces and mosques. © Ozan Kose, AFP\n\nCenturies later, an economics professor called Isil Akbaygil with a passion for Ottoman art set up the Iznik Foundation in 1993.\n\nHer research project brought together experts and academics to rediscover the lost secrets of Iznik's prized ceramics.\n\n'No recipe left'\n\n\"What was forgotten about isn't so much the raw materials themselves as how they're combined... the firing temperatures and methods to achieve the distinctive coral red,\" said Kerim Akbaygil, a foundation board member and one of her sons.\n\n\"The foundation spent almost two years trying to get the right recipe, working with different universities like MIT, Princeton and Istanbul Technical University,\" he said.\n\nThe secrets of Ottoman tilework were passed on orally for centuries but the tradition was lost as the empire declined. © Ozan Kose, AFP\n\n\"It was trial and error but we finally got it right,\" he told AFP at the foundation's headquarters, a rustic red-tiled building set in lush gardens lined with richly-coloured tile paths.\n\n\"Iznik tiles are the only tiles in the world that use up to 85 percent quartz which we use in the raw material along with clay and silica,\" he said.\n\nThey are underglazed with a high ratio of quartz giving them a \"brightness and depth that are characteristic of Iznik tiles\", he said.\n\nDecorated with metal oxides whose colours are rendered vivid through the firing process, they are then coated with a quartz-based glaze known as \"sur\" – Turkish for \"secret\".\n\n'The beauty of surprise'\n\nJars of colours – from vibrant cobalt blues and emerald greens to coral reds – line the shelves inside a large upper room where a dozen women sit painting tiles or transferring designs onto plain white tableware.\n\nThe foundation worked with experts and academics to rediscover the lost formula for the stonepaste and colours like the vibrant 'coral red'. © Ozan Kose, AFP\n\nMany are painting an enormous mural for a train station – one of the foundation's trademark commissions, its stunning tile facades a distinctive feature of the Istanbul metro and beyond.\n\nAdding shadow to a giant fig leaf, Yasemin Sahin, 42, admits she's captivated by the transformation that occurs with firing.\n\n\"I'm painting this but I don't know what it will look like when it comes out of the kiln after it's glazed. It's always a surprise, that's the beauty of it,\" she told AFP.\n\nThree decades on and Iznik tiles are now seen on buildings across Turkey, from colleges to coffee shops, with the foundation's international reach spreading form Japan to Canada.\n\nRediscovering the lost secrets of Iznik's vibrant tilework has 'revived a living tradition', experts say. © Ozan Kose, AFP\n\n\"Back in the day, Iznik tiles were sponsored by the palace, so the only place you could see them was inside the palaces or mosques. Now that taboo is broken,\" Akbaygil says.\n\nYalcinkaya said the collective significance of rediscovering the lost formulas was \"tremendous\" and the result of extensive research by many academics and scholars.\n\n\"These efforts revived a living tradition,\" she told AFP.\n\n\"Ottoman ceramicists continuously innovated from the 14th-20th centuries. Today's work continues this spirit, ensuring the tradition remains alive and relevant, which is the most authentic way to preserve cultural heritage.\"\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)",

The Culture and Education Committee of the European Parliament has demanded significantly more funding than the EU Commission is willing to allocate to the area. Nevertheless, the committee chair does not seem dissatisfied with the financial plan, as she states in the interview.\n\nBrussels (enr) – The chairwoman of the Culture and Education Committee in the European Parliament, Nela Riehl, has reacted cautiously positively to the EU Commission’s proposals for the future financing of culture and education projects by the EU. While the committee is not completely happy with the planned amount of funding allocated for this area in the EU’s multiannual financial framework (MFF), the MFF draft also shows that “culture is recognized as a value and as a strategic tool,” said the politician from Hamburg in an interview with the European Newsrooms (enr).\n\nThe committee had demanded that in the future, two percent of the funds allocated in the MFF be planned for cultural and educational purposes. Although this two percent target is far from being met, the draft does foresee an increase in cultural and educational spending. “It could have been worse,” said Riehl, who pointed out that a lot of money is currently being spent on defense in the EU. This is also quite right, said Riehl. “But if it’s not for culture, for free expression (…) and for building a resilient society: What are we actually defending?”\n\nAccording to the EU Commission, the MFF draft for the years 2028 to 2034 includes, among other things, 41 billion euros for the Erasmus+ exchange and education program, as well as 9 billion euros for a new program called AgoraEU, which aims to support culture, media, and community values.\n\nRisks for Cultural Creators\n\nHowever, Riehl sees a risk with AgoraEU that arises from the merging of several individual programs. The EU Commission states that this makes funding more flexible, but the price for that is a lower stability of funding, which is important for the cultural sector. It is concerning, for example, that the word film no longer appears in the description. There is a fear that it will be much easier for large companies to gain access to the funding programs in the future, while it will become significantly harder for independent filmmakers, for example.\n\nThe financial framework for the years 2028 to 2034 is expected to allow total EU expenditures of around two trillion euros, which would be about 700 billion euros more than the current seven-year budget period. The EU countries must unanimously approve the MFF, and the European Parliament must agree. If the necessary majority is not reached in Parliament, the proposal is considered rejected.\n\nNela Riehl is a Member of the European Parliament for the Volt party and belongs to the group The Greens/European Free Alliance in the European Parliament.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union is preparing its budget for 2026 and beyond, called the multiannual financial framework (MFF). This budget decides how much money will be spent on different areas, including culture and education.\n\n**What happened** – The Culture and Education Committee of the European Parliament asked for more money for culture and education than the EU Commission planned. The draft budget for 2028 to 2034 includes more funds than before, with 41 billion euros for the Erasmus+ education program and 9 billion euros for a new program called AgoraEU, which supports culture, media, and community values. Nela Riehl, chair of the committee, said the draft shows culture is seen as important and strategic, even if the funding target was not fully met.\n\n**Impact** – This budget draft is important because it increases money for cultural and educational projects across all EU countries. Programs like Erasmus+ help young people learn and travel, while AgoraEU aims to strengthen cultural activities and media. This support helps keep culture alive and encourages free expression, which is key to a strong society. However, there are concerns that some funding may become less stable, and smaller creators like independent filmmakers might find it harder to get support.\n\n**What's next step** – The draft budget still needs approval from all EU countries and the European Parliament. If they agree, the budget will be used from 2028 to 2034. Meanwhile, discussions will continue about how to make sure funding is fair and stable for all cultural groups.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU’s draft budget for 2028-2034 increases funding for culture and education, recognizing their value while raising new challenges to ensure fair support for all creators.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’Union européenne prépare son budget pour 2026 et les années suivantes, appelé cadre financier pluriannuel (CFP). Ce budget détermine combien d’argent sera consacré à différents domaines, notamment la culture et l’éducation.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – La commission Culture et Éducation du Parlement européen a demandé plus de fonds pour la culture et l’éducation que ce que la Commission européenne avait prévu. Le projet de budget pour 2028 à 2034 prévoit plus de financement qu’auparavant, avec 41 milliards d’euros pour le programme Erasmus+ et 9 milliards d’euros pour un nouveau programme appelé AgoraEU, qui soutient la culture, les médias et les valeurs communautaires. Nela Riehl, présidente de la commission, a déclaré que ce projet montre que la culture est reconnue comme importante et stratégique, même si l’objectif de financement n’est pas entièrement atteint.\n\n**Impact** – Ce projet de budget est important car il augmente les fonds pour des projets culturels et éducatifs dans tous les pays de l’UE. Des programmes comme Erasmus+ aident les jeunes à apprendre et voyager, tandis qu’AgoraEU vise à renforcer les activités culturelles et les médias. Ce soutien aide à maintenir la culture vivante et encourage l’expression libre, essentielle à une société forte. Cependant, certains craignent que le financement devienne moins stable, et que les petits créateurs, comme les cinéastes indépendants, aient plus de difficultés à obtenir du soutien.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – Le projet de budget doit encore être approuvé par tous les pays de l’UE et le Parlement européen. S’ils sont d’accord, ce budget sera utilisé de 2028 à 2034. Pendant ce temps, les discussions continueront pour garantir un financement équitable et stable pour tous les acteurs culturels.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le projet de budget de l’UE pour 2028-2034 augmente les fonds pour la culture et l’éducation, reconnaissant leur importance tout en posant de nouveaux défis pour assurer un soutien juste à tous les créateurs.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – La Unión Europea está preparando su presupuesto para 2026 y los años siguientes, llamado marco financiero plurianual (MFP). Este presupuesto decide cuánto dinero se gastará en diferentes áreas, incluyendo cultura y educación.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El Comité de Cultura y Educación del Parlamento Europeo pidió más dinero para cultura y educación que el que propuso la Comisión Europea. El borrador del presupuesto para 2028 a 2034 incluye más fondos que antes, con 41 mil millones de euros para el programa Erasmus+ y 9 mil millones para un nuevo programa llamado AgoraEU, que apoya la cultura, los medios y los valores comunitarios. Nela Riehl, presidenta del comité, dijo que el borrador muestra que la cultura se considera importante y estratégica, aunque no se alcanzó totalmente la meta de financiación.\n\n**Impacto** – Este borrador de presupuesto es importante porque aumenta el dinero para proyectos culturales y educativos en todos los países de la UE. Programas como Erasmus+ ayudan a los jóvenes a aprender y viajar, mientras que AgoraEU busca fortalecer las actividades culturales y los medios. Este apoyo ayuda a mantener viva la cultura y fomenta la libre expresión, clave para una sociedad fuerte. Sin embargo, hay preocupaciones de que algunos fondos sean menos estables y que los creadores pequeños, como cineastas independientes, tengan más dificultades para recibir apoyo.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El borrador del presupuesto todavía necesita la aprobación de todos los países de la UE y del Parlamento Europeo. Si lo aprueban, el presupuesto se usará de 2028 a 2034. Mientras tanto, seguirán las discusiones para asegurar que el financiamiento sea justo y estable para todos los grupos culturales.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – El borrador del presupuesto de la UE para 2028-2034 aumenta la financiación para cultura y educación, reconociendo su valor y planteando nuevos retos para asegurar un apoyo justo a todos los creadores.",
