      "title": "Dinosaur mummy found with hooves and a hidden crest",
      "summary": "Scientists have reconstructed the most complete and lifelike profile of Edmontosaurus annectens thanks to an extraordinary preservation process called clay templating, in which a thin clay film captured the dinosaur’s skin, scales, spikes, and even hooves in three dimensions. By combining newly excavated “mummies,” advanced imaging, and artistic reconstruction, researchers revealed a tall crest, a single row of tail spikes, delicate pebble-like scales, and—most remarkably—the earliest known hooves in any land vertebrate.",
      "content": "In a new paper in Science, researchers from the University of Chicago describe how, about 66 million years ago, the bodies of the duck-billed dinosaur Edmontosaurus annectens were transformed into remarkably detailed dinosaur \"mummies\" that preserved tiny features of skin, scales, and hooves. The team names the process \"clay templating.\" In this process, the outer soft tissues of the animal were preserved as a delicate clay coating that settled over the skeleton after burial, forming a mask less than 1/100th of an inch thick.\n\nWith a combination of advanced imaging methods, the scientists were able to recreate what the dinosaur would have looked like in life. Their reconstruction reveals a tall crest running along the neck and torso, a row of spikes down the tail, and hooves that enclosed the toes. When these results are combined with fossilized footprints, the overall appearance of this duck-billed dinosaur, long speculated about but never documented with this level of precision, becomes much clearer.\n\n\"It's the first time we've had a complete, fleshed-out view of a large dinosaur that we can really feel confident about,\" said senior author Paul Sereno, PhD, Professor of Organismal Biology and Anatomy at UChicago. \"The badlands in Wyoming where the finds were made is a unique 'mummy zone' that has more surprises in store from fossils collected over years of visits by teams of university undergrads.\"\n\nRediscovering Wyoming's dinosaur \"mummy zone\"\n\nUsing old field photographs and careful detective work, Sereno and his colleagues retraced the locations in east-central Wyoming where several classic dinosaur mummies had first been uncovered in the early 1900s. They mapped a compact \"mummy zone\" within these rock layers, which represent stacked river sands.\n\nIn this area, the team excavated two new Edmontosaurus mummies, a younger individual and a somewhat older one, both preserving large, continuous patches of the external skin surface. These fossils provided crucial pieces needed to build a full, fleshy profile of the animal.\n\nSereno emphasizes that these dinosaur mummies are very different from human-created mummies in Egyptian tombs; none of the original organic material is still present. In both the newly described specimens and earlier examples labeled as mummies (including those found at the same site in the 20th century), the preserved skin, spikes, and hooves exist not as tissue but as an extremely thin clay coating that formed on the outside of the carcass shortly after burial.\n\n\"This is a mask, a template, a clay layer so thin you could blow it away,\" Sereno said. \"It was attracted to the outside of the carcass in a fluke event of preservation.\"\n\nUltra-thin clay films capture dinosaur skin in 3D\n\nTo investigate how these extraordinary fossils formed, the team used a suite of imaging and analytical approaches. These included hospital and micro-CT scans, thin sections, X-ray spectroscopy, clay mineral analyses, and a close study of the rock layers where the fossils were found. All lines of evidence pointed toward a specific sequence of events that produced this rare style of preservation.\n\nThe researchers propose that after the dinosaurs died, their bodies dried in the sun before being rapidly buried in sudden flash floods. A microbial film on the outer surface of the carcass then attracted clay particles from the surrounding wet sediment through electrostatic forces. This process created a wafer-thin clay template that faithfully captured the animal's outer shape in three dimensions. Over time, the soft tissues decayed away, leaving the clay film and the skeleton, which later fossilized on longer timescales.\n\nCleaning, scanning and digitally rebuilding the duckbill\n\nRevealing a boundary as fragile as this paper-thin clay layer required painstaking work. Fossil Lab manager Tyler Keillor, a co-author on the study, led hours of meticulous preparation to uncover the crucial surfaces without destroying them.\n\nAnother group, led by postdoctoral scholar Evan Saitta, relied on 3D surface imaging, CT scans, and comparisons with fossil footprints from the same time period. They traced the preserved soft anatomy, examined the sediments inside and outside the mummy, and matched the dinosaur's hooves back into a footprint. Digital artists then worked alongside the scientists to create lifelike reconstructions that showed how the duckbill would have looked and moved as it walked across soft mud near the very end of the dinosaur age.\n\n\"I believe it's worth taking the time to assemble a dream team in order to generate science that can be appreciated by the general public,\" Sereno said. \"We've never been able to look at the appearance of a large prehistoric reptile like this -- and just in time for Halloween.\"\n\nCrest, spikes, scales and thin skin\n\nWorking from the two newly described mummies, the researchers were able to assemble a complete, fleshy outline of Edmontosaurus annectens.\n\n\"The two specimens complemented each other beautifully,\" Sereno said. \"For the first time, we could see the whole profile rather than scattered patches.\"\n\nThey discovered a continuous feature running along the center of the back that started as a fleshy crest over the neck and torso. Over the hips, this structure shifted into a single row of spikes along the tail, with each spike aligned above a vertebra and fitting neatly with its neighbors.\n\nThe team also documented the dinosaur's scale patterns. The largest polygonal scales appeared along the lower body and tail, while most of the animal was covered in very small, pebble-like scales only 1-4 millimeters across, surprisingly tiny for a dinosaur that could reach more than 40 feet in length. Fine wrinkles preserved over the ribcage indicate that the skin of this duckbill was relatively thin.\n\nHooves and heel pads on a \"hoofed\" dinosaur\n\nThe most unexpected discovery came from the larger mummy's hind feet: this dinosaur had hooves. The tips of each of the three hind toes were enclosed in a wedge-shaped hoof with a flat underside, similar to that of a horse.\n\nTo confirm what these feet looked like in life, the researchers combined CT scans of the mummified feet with 3D images of the best-preserved duckbill footprint from the same time period, carefully aligning the bones and soft-tissue impressions. With this information, they produced a detailed reconstruction of the hind foot. Unlike the forefoot, which makes contact with the ground only through its hooves, the hind feet also included a fleshy heel pad behind the hooves.\n\n\"There are so many amazing 'firsts' preserved in these duck-billed mummies -- the earliest hooves documented in a land vertebrate, the first confirmed hooved reptile, and the first hooved four-legged animal with different forelimb and hindlimb posture,\" Sereno said.\n\nA new toolkit for dinosaur soft-tissue research\n\nBeyond revealing striking new anatomy, the research provides a practical framework for future studies of dinosaur soft tissue. The authors outline new preparation techniques, a clear set of terms for describing soft structures and scale types, a step-by-step imaging pathway from fossil specimen to fleshed-out model, and a recipe for how a dinosaur mummy can form under natural conditions.\n\nTheir work offers more than a series of isolated findings. It proposes a general model for dinosaur mummification based on clay templating, which can now be tested on other fossils that might have formed in similar ways.\n\nThe team also highlights the next steps: focused searches for additional specimens with this kind of preservation in the same Wyoming rock layers and in other regions; biomechanical studies that can now rely on accurate external body outlines; and complementary analyses designed to understand when and where clay templating is most likely to occur.\n\n\"This may be the single best paper I've released,\" Sereno said. \"From field to lab to 3D reconstructions along with a suite of useful terms defined, it's a tour de force, and it tells a coherent story about how these remarkable fossils come to be and what we can learn from them.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – About 66 million years ago, a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus annectens lived in what is now Wyoming. Usually, only bones are found from dinosaurs, but sometimes soft parts like skin can be preserved under special conditions.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from the University of Chicago studied new dinosaur fossils found in Wyoming’s “mummy zone.” These fossils are called dinosaur mummies because a very thin layer of clay covered the skin and other soft parts, preserving details like scales, spikes, and even hooves. Using advanced imaging like CT scans and artistic reconstructions, scientists recreated a lifelike model showing a tall crest on its neck, a row of tail spikes, tiny pebble-like scales, and the earliest known hooves on a land vertebrate.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is unique because it gives the most complete and clear picture of a large dinosaur’s outside appearance. The hooves show that some dinosaurs had features similar to modern hoofed animals, which scientists did not know before. The thin clay layer preserved the skin in 3D, a very rare and delicate type of fossil. This helps scientists understand how dinosaurs looked and moved more accurately than ever.\n\n**What's next step** – The team plans to look for more fossils with this special clay preservation in Wyoming and other places. They also want to study how dinosaurs moved using the new detailed body shapes. Their methods offer a new way to find and study soft tissues in other dinosaur fossils.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists used a rare clay preservation to create the most detailed and lifelike model of a duck-billed dinosaur, revealing hooves and a crest for the first time.\n",

Ces fossiles sont appelés momies de dinosaures car une couche très fine d'argile a recouvert la peau et d'autres parties molles, préservant des détails comme les écailles, les épines et même les sabots. Grâce à des techniques d'imagerie avancées comme les scanners CT et des reconstitutions artistiques, les scientifiques ont créé un modèle réaliste montrant une haute crête sur le cou, une rangée d'épines sur la queue, de petites écailles en forme de galets et les plus anciens sabots connus sur un vertébré terrestre.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte est unique car elle donne l'image la plus complète et claire de l'apparence extérieure d'un grand dinosaure. Les sabots montrent que certains dinosaures avaient des caractéristiques similaires aux animaux à sabots modernes, ce qu'on ne savait pas auparavant. La fine couche d'argile a préservé la peau en 3D, un type de fossile très rare et délicat.

      "summary": "A tiny 242-million-year-old fossil from Devon is shaking up scientists’ assumptions about the earliest members of the lizard lineage. Instead of the expected skull hinges and palate teeth typical of modern lizards and snakes, this ancient creature shows a surprising mix of primitive and unusual traits—along with strikingly large, blade-like teeth. High-resolution synchrotron scans revealed details invisible to the naked eye, helping researchers name the new species Agriodontosaurus helsbypetrae and rethink the origins of lepidosaurs, the diverse group that now includes more than 12,000 species.",
      "content": "A recently analyzed fossil from Devon is giving scientists a rare look at what the earliest members of the lizard lineage may have looked like, and the findings come with several unexpected twists, according to researchers at the University of Bristol. The work was published in Nature.\n\nToday, lizards and their close relatives, including snakes and the distinctive tuatara from New Zealand, form the most diverse group of land vertebrates. With more than 12,000 species, they outnumber birds and mammals. Their collective group, known as Lepidosauria, has achieved remarkable success, raising long-standing questions about which early traits gave them such an advantage.\n\nReconsidering Early Lepidosaur Features\n\nScientists had anticipated that the earliest lepidosaurs would show traits also present in many modern lizards and snakes. These expected features included a partly hinged skull, an open lower temporal bar, and numerous teeth on the roof of the mouth (palate). In living species, these adaptations allow the animals to open their jaws extremely wide (skull hinge) and use palate teeth to secure struggling prey.\n\nThe lower temporal bar functions much like a cheek bone. It connects the cheek region to the jaw hinge and is missing in modern lizards and snakes. Although many living species share flexible skulls and other advanced traits, only the tuatara still retains a complete lower temporal bar, giving it a more ancestral appearance. The tuatara also maintains large palatal teeth, which further highlight its links to early reptiles.\n\nUnexpected Anatomy Revealed\n\n\"The new fossil shows almost none of what we expected,\" said Dan Marke, who led the study as part of his MSc in Palaeobiology at Bristol. \"It has no teeth on the palate, and no sign of any hinging. It does though have the open temporal bar, so one out of three. Not only this but it possesses some spectacularly large teeth compared to its closest relatives.\"\n\nAdvanced Scanning Exposes Hidden Details\n\n\"In modern paleontological studies we often X-ray scan the fossils,\" noted Dr. David Whiteside, a co-supervisor of the project. \"But the exceptional resolution and quality of scans from synchrotron X-ray sources show us all the fine details and save any risk of damage.\n\n\"An earlier MSc student, Thitiwoot Sethapanichsakul, had worked on the regular scans and found fantastic detail, but it's so tiny -- the skull is only 1.5 cm long, and we could barely see the teeth. So, we were so grateful to be able to make synchrotron CT scans to get even finer resolution, using two powerful beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (France) and the Diamond Light Source (UK).\"\n\nA Tiny Skeleton With Remarkable Preservation\n\n\"When you look at the fossil, the whole skeleton sits in the palm of your hand,\" explained Michael Benton, another co-supervisor and Professor of Vertebrate Paleontology in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.\n\n\"But after the scans and the hard work of our students cleaning up the scan data, we can see the most amazing detail. The new beast has relatively large triangular-shaped teeth and probably used these to pierce and shear the hard cuticles of its insect prey, pretty much as the tuatara does today.\"\n\nA New Species With Unique Traits\n\n\"The new animal is unlike anything yet discovered and has made us all think again about the evolution of the lizard, snakes and the tuatara,\" said Dan Marke. \"We had to give it a name to distinguish it from everything else, and we chose Agriodontosaurus helsbypetrae, quite a mouthful, meaning 'fierce toothed lizard from the Helsby rock\" after the Helsby Sandstone Formation in which it was discovered.\n\n\"This specimen not only provides important information about the ancestral skull of all lepidosaurs but also builds on the growing knowledge that the tuatara, while often called a \"living fossil\"; belongs to a once-diverse order of ancient reptiles with a rich evolutionary history.\"\n\nTracing Early Reptile Evolution\n\nThe fossil dates to 242 million years ago during the Middle Triassic, just before the emergence of dinosaurs. From that point onward, lepidosaurs underwent several waves of diversification. Early forms likely slipped through the undergrowth beneath the feet of dinosaurs and succeeded by evolving a variety of strategies for capturing prey. These included flexible jaws and, in some lizards and snakes, venom.\n\nA Chance Find on a Devon Beach\n\n\"When I found the specimen back in 2015 on the beach in Devon, I had no idea what it was because there was so little of it exposed,\" added Dr. Rob Coram. \"It's been great to see such an amazing fossil coming from a site that has been providing fossils for 150 years.\"",
