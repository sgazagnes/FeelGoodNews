Researchers found that yeast cells can survive intense shock waves and toxic chemicals similar to those on Mars.

This resilience could make yeast a powerful model for astrobiology and future space missions.",
      "content": "Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is best known for its role in baking, brewing, and modern biotechnology. Yet this everyday microorganism may also offer insight into a far bigger question: how life might endure the extreme conditions found beyond Earth.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Biochemistry (BC) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), working with collaborators at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad, have discovered that yeast can survive environmental stresses similar to those on Mars. Their findings suggest that even simple life forms may be more resilient to extraterrestrial conditions than previously assumed.\n\nSimulating Mars With Shock Waves and Toxic Soil\n\nTo test yeast survival, the research team subjected living cells to intense physical and chemical stress. The experiments included exposure to powerful shock waves comparable to those created by meteorite impacts on Mars, as well as perchlorate salts, which are toxic compounds known to exist in Martian soil.\n\nThe shock waves were generated using a High-Intensity Shock Tube for Astrochemistry (HISTA) located in Bhalamurugan Sivaraman's laboratory at PRL. These waves reached speeds of up to Mach 5.6. In addition, yeast cells were treated with 100 mM sodium perchlorate, either on its own or combined with shock wave exposure.\n\nOvercoming Experimental Challenges\n\nSetting up the experiments posed major technical difficulties. According to the researchers, exposing live yeast cells to shock waves at this intensity had never been done before.\n\n\"One of the biggest hurdles was setting up the HISTA tube to expose live yeast cells to shock waves -- something that has not been attempted before -- and then recovering yeast with minimum contamination for downstream experiments,\" explains lead author Riya Dhage, a project assistant in the lab of Purusharth I Rajyaguru, Associate Professor in BC.\n\nHow Yeast Survived Extreme Stress\n\nDespite the harsh conditions, the yeast cells remained alive after exposure to shock waves, perchlorate salts, and even both stressors combined. While their growth slowed, survival rates remained high.\n\nThe researchers believe this resilience comes from the yeast's ability to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates. These are tiny structures without membranes that help cells protect and reorganize mRNA when under stress. Shock wave exposure caused yeast cells to form two types of RNP condensates known as stress granules and P-bodies. When exposed only to perchlorate salts, the cells formed P-bodies. Yeast strains that lacked the ability to create these structures were much less likely to survive.\n\nBiomarkers for Life Under Alien Conditions\n\nThe findings suggest that RNP condensates could serve as biomarkers, or biological indicators, of cellular stress in extraterrestrial environments. This provides scientists with a potential tool for identifying how life responds to extreme conditions beyond Earth.\n\n\"What makes this work unique is the integration of shock wave physics and chemical biology with molecular cell biology to probe how life might cope with such Mars-like stressors,\" says Dhage.\n\nImplications for Astrobiology and Space Exploration\n\nThe study highlights baker's yeast as a powerful model organism for India's growing astrobiology research efforts. By examining how yeast reorganizes its RNA and proteins when exposed to mechanical and chemical stress, scientists can gain valuable insight into how life forms might survive on other planets.\n\nThese insights may also help guide the development of biological systems designed to withstand extreme environments in space.\n\n\"We were surprised to observe yeast surviving the Mars-like stress conditions that we used in our experiments,\" says Rajyaguru, the corresponding author of the study. \"We hope that this study will galvanize efforts to have yeast on board in future space explorations.\"",

Simonnet/Sonoma State University; LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration; University of Rhode Island\n\nThe loudest collision ever recorded between two black holes has allowed scientists to test Einstein’s theory of general relativity in unprecedented detail, showing that the physicist’s predictions were once again correct.\n\nIn 2025, an international collaboration of gravitational wave detectors, made up of ultra-sensitive laser arrays, detected a powerful ripple in the fabric of space-time, labelled GW250114, probably produced by the merger of two black holes.\n\nThe detectors, which include the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in the US and the Virgo detector in Italy, are far more sensitive than when LIGO made its first detection in 2016. This meant that GW250114 had the clearest and most noise-free data of any gravitational wave event so far, making it a unique testbed for predictions from otherwise well-tested physical theories.\n\nLast year, researchers used data from GW250114 to test Stephen Hawking’s theorem, proposed more than 50 years ago, that a merged black hole’s event horizon, the region within which light can no longer escape, would not be smaller than the sum of its parent black holes. The results showed with nearly 100 per cent confidence that Hawking was correct.\n\nNow, Keefe Mitman at Cornell University in New York and his colleagues have gone a step further and tested whether the black hole merger conforms with Albert Einstein’s general relativity.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nEinstein’s original equations describe how any object with mass moves through space-time. When these equations are tweaked for two black holes merging and then solved, a distinct picture emerges. The black holes first spiral around each other with increasing speed, then crash together, releasing a colossal burst of energy, before vibrating at distinct frequencies, similar to how a bell rings after it has been struck.\n\nThese frequencies, called ringdown modes, have been too faint to see in previous gravitational wave events, but GW250114 was loud enough that the modes predicted by Einstein’s equations could be properly tested. Mitman and his colleagues simulated Einstein’s equations and produced predictions of how loud and at what frequencies these black hole vibrations should be. When they compared them to the measured frequencies, they closely matched.\n\n“The amplitudes that we measure in the data agree incredibly well with the predictions from numerical relativity,” says Mitman. “Einstein’s equations are really hard to solve, but when we do solve them and we observe predictions of general relativity in our detectors, those two agree.”\n\n“The upshot is Einstein is still correct,” says Laura Nuttall at the University of Portsmouth, UK. “Everything seems to look like what Einstein says about gravity.”\n\nDespite the loudness of GW250114, the frequencies were still so faint that Mitman and his team couldn’t rule out that they might differ from Einstein’s predictions by less than about 10 per cent. This is mainly a consequence of the limitations in the sensitivity of our detectors, says Mitman, and should decrease as we improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. However, if Einstein’s theory is incorrect in some way, then this difference will persist.\n\n“As we observe more and more events, or see louder single events, what could happen is that those error bars could just shrink to being around zero, or it could shrink to being away from zero,” says Mitman. “If it shrinks to being away from zero, that’s much more interesting.”\n\nJournal reference: Physical Review Letters, DOI: 10.1103/6c61-fm1n",

To push capabilities further and ensure safe, successful missions, NASA must test ideas and solve challenges ahead of time. While Earth-based research and engineering helps NASA progress through various challenges, it can’t fully replicate the space environment. That’s where the International Space Station comes in — an out-of-this-world laboratory where astronauts help prepare for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\n\n(From left) Andreas Mogensen of ESA (European Space Agency); Loral O’Hara and Jasmin Moghbeli, both from NASA; and Satoshi Furukawa of JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), showing off crew active dosimeters used for radiation monitoring. Credit: NASA NASA\n\nSince 2000, NASA and its partners have used the orbiting laboratory to conduct groundbreaking research and collaborate to advance human exploration to the depths of our solar system. Research aboard the space station helped lay the foundation for the Orion spacecraft’s life support and safety systems, which will carry four astronauts around the Moon during the Artemis II mission. These systems include radiation sensing equipment, carbon dioxide removal systems, a water-based portable fire extinguisher, emergency fire masks, the toilet, a heat exchanger, and a backup emergency navigation system.\n\nArtemis II also includes a set of science objectives, many rooted in research and methods pioneered aboard the space station. One example is Spaceflight Standard Measures, an experiment that tracks psychological and physiological data points. This research will branch off to collect astronaut information beyond low Earth orbit, deepening our understanding of how the body adapts to living and working far from Earth.\n\nOrgan-chip experiments use small devices containing cells to model how tissues and organs respond to space stressors and therapeutic treatments. These devices and their related hardware have been used in several experiments aboard the space station and will continue their legacy in the lunar environment to study the effects of deep space stressors on human health using cells from Artemis II astronauts. Organ-chip research could be used to develop improved prevention and personalized medical treatments for people on Earth and in space.\n\nNASA astronaut Jonny Kim takes a photo of Earth landmarks from the International Space Station’s cupola.

The crew will analyze and photograph geologic features on the lunar far side, providing critical information for Artemis III surface exploration. Frameworks from Earth observations, including target planning, visualization software, and scripts, have been adapted for lunar observations, shaping operations and preparing for future exploration missions.\n\nSmall, cost-effective satellites called CubeSats are deployed from space station and other spacecraft to test new technologies and conduct scientific research in low Earth orbit. Building on this success, NASA is partnering with international agencies to deploy CubeSats aboard Artemis II for technology demonstrations and studies in high Earth orbit.\n\nThe space station remains a critical testbed for optimizing communications, robotics, and other technologies for missions to the Moon and Mars. Researchers also study the effects of spaceflight on people, develop tools to monitor crew health, and enhance plant growth to support astronaut safety and wellbeing.\n\nAs humans prepare to venture beyond Earth’s orbit for the first time in more than 50 years, we celebrate the space station and other NASA programs that walked so Artemis could run.",
