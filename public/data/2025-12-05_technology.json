      "content": "Sometimes, having less oxygen truly makes a difference. By lowering oxygen levels during synthesis, a group of materials scientists at Penn State succeeded in creating seven previously unknown high-entropy oxides, or HEOs. These ceramics contain five or more metals and are being explored for uses in energy storage, electronic devices and protective coatings.\n\nDuring the development of these materials, the team also outlined a broader framework for designing future materials. Their findings were published in Nature Communications.\n\n\"By carefully removing oxygen from the atmosphere of the tube furnace during synthesis, we stabilized two metals, iron and manganese, into the ceramics that would not otherwise stabilize in the ambient atmosphere,\" said corresponding and first author Saeed Almishal, a research professor at Penn State working with Jon-Paul Maria, the Dorothy Pate Enright Professor of Materials Science.\n\nEarly Breakthroughs and Machine Learning Discovery\n\nAlmishal first achieved stability in a material containing manganese and iron by adjusting oxygen levels in a composition he designated as J52. That sample included magnesium, cobalt, nickel, manganese and iron. After that initial success, he used newly developed machine learning capabilities that can rapidly evaluate thousands of possible formulations. With those tools, he identified six additional metal combinations capable of forming HEOs.\n\nWorking alongside undergraduate researchers who helped process, fabricate and characterize samples, Almishal produced solid ceramic pellets representing all seven new HEO compositions. These students were supported by the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Penn State's Center for Nanoscale Science, a U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center.\n\n\"In a single step, we stabilized all seven compositions that are possible given our current framework,\" Almishal said. \"Although this was previously treated this as a complex problem in the field of HEOs, the solution was simple in the end. With a careful understanding of the fundamentals of material and ceramic synthesis science, and particularly the principles of thermodynamics, we found the answer.\"\n\nHow Oxygen Levels Shape the Materials\n\nTo stabilize these ceramics, manganese and iron atoms must remain in the 2+ oxidation state, forming what is known as a rock salt structure where each atom bonds with only two oxygen atoms. According to Almishal, this does not happen under typical oxygen-rich conditions. If synthesized in a normal atmosphere, manganese and iron would continue binding with oxygen and shift to a higher oxidation state, preventing the material from forming correctly. Reducing the oxygen in the tube furnace limits how many oxygen atoms are available, allowing the desired rock salt structure to form.\n\n\"The main rule we followed in synthesizing these materials is the role that oxygen plays in stabilizing such ceramic materials,\" Almishal said.\n\nConfirming Structure and Planning Future Experiments\n\nTo verify that manganese and iron truly remained in the intended oxidation state, Almishal collaborated with researchers at Virginia Tech. Their team used an advanced imaging approach that examines how atoms absorb X-rays. By studying the resulting data, they could confirm the oxidation states of individual elements and demonstrate that the materials were stable.\n\nThe next stage of work will involve testing the magnetic properties of all seven new HEOs. The researchers also hope to use the same thermodynamic principles for oxygen control to stabilize other types of materials that are currently difficult to synthesize.\n\n\"This paper, which has already been accessed online thousands of times, seems to resonate with researchers because of its simplicity,\" Almishal said. \"Although we focus on rock salt HEOs, our methods provide a broad adaptable framework for enabling uncharted, promising chemically disordered complex oxides.\"\n\nUndergraduate Recognition and Research Collaboration\n\nBecause of his significant contributions in the lab, co-author and undergraduate materials science and engineering major Matthew Furst was invited to present the findings at the American Ceramic Society's (ACerS) Annual Meeting with Materials Science and Technology 2025, which took place Sept. 28 through Oct. 1 in Columbus, Ohio. This invitation is typically extended to faculty or senior graduate students.\n\n\"I am so grateful for the opportunities that I have had on this project and to be involved in every step of the research and publication process,\" Furst said. \"Being able to present this material to a broad audience as an invited talk reflects my involvement and the excellent guidance I have received from my mentors. It means a lot to me to develop important communication skills as an undergraduate student, and I look forward to pushing myself further in the future!\"\n\nTeam Members and Support\n\nIn addition to Almishal, Maria and Furst, the Penn State research team included undergraduate students Joseph Petruska and Dhiya Srikanth; graduate students Yueze Tan and Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari; and Jacob Sivak, who recently earned a doctorate in chemistry with a materials science focus. Faculty collaborators included Nasim Alem, professor of materials science and engineering; Susan Sinnott, professor of materials science and engineering and of chemistry; and Long-Qing Chen, the Hamer Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, professor of engineering science and mechanics and of mathematics.\n\nFrom Virginia Tech, the co-authors were Christina Rost, assistant professor of materials science and engineering, and graduate student Gerald Bejger.\n\nThe Penn State Center for Nanoscale Science, an U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, provided support for this research.",

Using a specially shaped molecule called azupyrene, scientists can produce graphene films rich in beneficial 5–7 ring defects—imperfections that make the material more interactive, more magnetic, and more electronically versatile.",
      "content": "Recent research has revealed a technique for producing graphene that deliberately incorporates structural defects to enhance its performance. This strategy could help advance several fields, including sensors, batteries and electronics.\n\nScientists from the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry, the University of Warwick and Diamond Light Source created a single-step approach that grows graphene-like films using a molecule called Azupyrene. The shape of this molecule closely resembles the type of defect the researchers wanted to introduce. Their findings were published recently in Chemical Science.\n\nWhy Imperfections Can Improve Graphene\n\nDavid Duncan, Associate Professor from the University of Nottingham and one of the study's lead authors, explains: \"Our study explores a new way to make graphene, this super-thin, super-strong material is made of carbon atoms, and while perfect graphene is remarkable, it is sometimes too perfect. It interacts weakly with other materials and lacks crucial electronic properties required in the semiconductor industry.\n\n\"Usually defects in material are seen as problems or mistakes that reduce performance, we have used them intentionally to add functionality. We found the defects can make the graphene more \"sticky\" to other materials, making it more useful as a catalyst, as well as improving its capability of detecting different gasses for use in sensors. The defects can also alter the electronic and magnetic properties of the graphene, for potential applications in the semiconductor industry.\"\n\nAzupyrene Enables Precise Control of Defect Formation\n\nGraphene is normally built from a repeating pattern of six carbon atoms arranged in a flat ring. The defect targeted in this research consists of neighboring 5 and 7 atom rings. Azupyrene naturally contains this type of irregular ring pattern, making it an ideal starting molecule. By using Azupyrene to grow the graphene films, the team achieved a high concentration of this specific defect. Adjusting the temperature during the growth phase allowed the researchers to fine-tune how many defects appeared in the final material.\n\nResearchers at the Graphene Institute in Manchester also showed that the resulting graphene could be transferred onto a variety of surfaces while keeping the engineered defects intact, an important step toward integrating these films into real devices.\n\nInternational Collaboration and Advanced Tools Reveal Atomic Behavior\n\nThe project relied on a broad set of advanced techniques and involved teams from the UK, Germany and Sweden. Researchers used high-resolution microscopy and spectroscopy at Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire and at MAX IV in Sweden, along with the UK national supercomputer ARCHER2. These tools enabled them to examine the atomic structure of the defective graphene, confirm the presence of the engineered defects and determine how they influenced the material's chemical and electronic behavior.\n\nProfessor Reinhard Maurer from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick states: \"By carefully choosing the starting molecule and the growth conditions, we've shown it's possible to grow graphene in which imperfections can be introduced in a more controlled way. We characterize the signatures of these imperfects by bringing together atomic-scale imaging, spectroscopy, and computational simulation.\"\n\n\"This study is a testament to what can be achieved through international collaboration and the integration of diverse scientific expertise,\" said Dr. Tien-Lin Lee from Diamond Light Source. \"By combining advanced microscopy, spectroscopy, and computational modelling across institutions in the UK, Germany, and Sweden, we were able to uncover the atomic-scale mechanisms behind defect formation in graphene, something no single technique or team could have achieved alone.\"",

      "content": "Credit: Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nChinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek has released a mathematical reasoning model that can identify and correct its own errors. The model beat the best human score in one of the world’s most prestigious undergraduate maths competitions.\n\nThe model, DeepSeekMath-V2, scored 118 out of 120 points on questions from the 2024 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, beating the top human score of 90. The model also performed at the level of gold-medal winners in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2025 and the 2024 China Mathematical Olympiad. The results are described in a preprint1 posted on arXiv on 27 November.\n\n“We are at a point where AI is about as good at maths as a smart undergraduate student,” says Kevin Buzzard, a mathematician at Imperial College London. “It is very exciting.”\n\nIn February, AlphaGeometry 2, an AI problem solver created by Google DeepMind in London, also achieved a gold-level performance in the IMO. The feat was repeated in July by Gemini’s Deep Think, which is owned by DeepMind.\n\nReasoning over answers\n\nEarly approaches to training large language models for mathematical reasoning focused on the accuracy of final answers, the preprint authors write. But a correct answer does not guarantee correct reasoning. At times, a correct final answer might just be a result of a fortunate error. Moreover, an exclusive focus on the end result is not useful in proving mathematical laws or formulae, when the logical reasoning is more important than the final answer.\n\nTong Xie, a chemist specialising in AI-driven discoveries at UNSW Sydney in Australia, says the researchers behind DeepSeek, as well as those developing Gemini’s Deep Think, have been working on overcoming this problem by rewarding reasoning over the final answer.\n\nDeepSeekMath-V2 introduces self-verifiable mathematical reasoning for the first time. The model consists of a verifier trained to evaluate mathematical proofs — which are built on a series of step-by-step deductions — to identify logical flaws and assign scores based on how rigorous the proof was. A meta-verification system then checks whether the verifier’s critiques are accurate, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations and improving trustworthiness. These components work with a proof generator that constructs solutions and evaluates its own work, refining arguments until no further issues can be found.\n\nThe design creates a feedback loop: the verifier improves the generator, and as the generator produces more-challenging proofs, these become new training data to strengthen the verifier.\n\nThe system was able to solve five out of six problems, scoring 83.3%, in the 2025 IMO. It was, however, unable to solve the hardest problems set in 2025 and in past IMOs.\n\nMath-V2 relies on self-verification using natural language in the model itself, Xie says. This reduces human involvement and makes the model more cost-effective and scalable.\n\nGemini's Deep Think, by contrast, verifies mathematical reasoning using an external, symbolic language called Lean, and its verification process requires extensive expert input. The method is nearly free of hallucination, but it is computationally expensive and resource-intensive, Xie says.",

This requires a more advanced tool, and that’s where GlennICE comes in.”\n\nSo far, dozens of industry partners as well as other government agencies have started using GlennICE, which is available on NASA’s software catalog.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that\n\nsupports HTML5 video Timelapse video of an ice accretion on the 65% common research model.

The new toolkit can be tailored to unique situations and is compatible with other software tools. In other words, it is more configurable, and much less time consuming for researchers to set up and use.\n\nThis streamlined process, along with its more-advanced ability to model icing, allows GlennICE to easily tackle 21st-century concepts such as supersonic planes, advanced air mobility drones and other aircraft, unconventionally shaped wings, open-rotor turbofan designs, or new configurations for conventional aircraft such as radar domes.\n\nBut how does this simulation process work?\n\n“Imagine an aircraft flying through a cloud,” Porter said. “Some of those water and ice droplets hit the aircraft and some of them don’t. GlennICE simulates these droplets and exactly where they will end up, both on the aircraft and not.”\n\nWhen these water droplets hit the aircraft, they attach, freeze, and start to gather even more droplets that do the same. The software simulates exactly where this will occur, and what shape the ice will take over time.\n\n“We’re not just dealing with the airplane, but the physics of the air and water as well,” Porter said.\n\nBecause it’s designed for simulating droplets, researchers have expressed interest in using GlennICE to simulate other conditions involving sand and ash. These substances, when ingested by aircraft engines, can pose separate risks that aeronautical engineers work to prevent.\n\nGlenn Icing Computational Environment (GlennICE) simulated ice accretions (blue) on the High Lift Common Research Model (gray).

The agency’s wind tunnels, for instance, have world-class icing research capabilities not commonly found in aeronautics research.\n\nPaired with wind tunnel testing, GlennICE offers a holistic set of capabilities to researchers. While wind tunnels can verify and validate data with real-world models and conditions, tools like GlennICE can fill gaps in research not easily achieved with wind tunnels.\n\n“Some environments we need to test in are impractical with wind tunnels because of the tunnel size required and complex physics involved,” Porter said. “But with GlennICE, we can do these tests digitally. For example, we can model all the icing conditions noted in new regulations.”\n\nThe GlennICE development falls under NASA’s Transformative Aeronautics Concept and Advanced Air Vehicles programs. Those programs supported GlennICE to further NASA’s work on computational tool development for aerospace design.
