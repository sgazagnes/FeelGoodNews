      "content": "Vernon Morris (outlined) with alumni from the atmospheric sciences PhD programme he established at Howard University in Washington DC.Credit: Vernon Morris\n\nChangemakers This Nature Q&A series celebrates individuals who have fought racism in science and who champion inclusion. The series often highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nWhen Vernon Morris earned his doctorate in Earth and atmospheric sciences in 1991 from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, he was the first African American to do so, joining fewer than a dozen other Black atmospheric sciences PhD holders in the United States at that time.\n\nFrom the get-go, Morris knew that something needed to change to create more opportunities for Black scientists in his field. In 2001, as a professor at Howard University in Washington DC, he became founding director of the first PhD-granting graduate programme in atmospheric sciences at a historically Black college and university (HBCU). Between 2006 and 2018, that programme produced at least 50% of African American and 30% of Latinx PhD graduates in atmospheric sciences in the United States.\n\nA specialist in airborne particle processes, Morris studies long-range transport of mineral dust from desert regions and densely populated areas, such as megacities. His team’s work feeds into global and regional models of weather and climate that are used to make predictions in forecast models for hurricanes and tropical storms.\n\nI encourage women to claim their space in astrophysics and beyond\n\nFor example, Morris studies microbial populations found on grains of desert sand transported from Africa to the Caribbean, and then on to the continental United States and South America. “We’re finding fairly rich microbial populations on those” grains, he says, and the populations “change as the surface chemistry changes”. These microorganisms can affect ecosystem health in the oceans or in soils where they are deposited, he notes. Understanding particle transport “can have domino effects in how we understand biogeochemistry and microbial exchange between continents”, he says.\n\nMorris is now an associate dean for knowledge enterprise and strategic outcomes at Arizona State University in Tempe. Much as with particle transport, his influence on younger generations of scientists is far-reaching.\n\nIn 2023, Morris received the American Geophysical Union’s Lifetime Achievement Award for Diversity and Inclusion. He was recognized for having mentored more than 200 students and geoscientists of colour and for creating partnerships that benefited at least 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students. What’s more, he initiated No Time for Silence, a collaborative call to action for anti-racism in the geoscience community. Morris spoke to Nature about chasing dust storms and why science needs intellectual activists now more than ever.\n\nWhat’s the coolest discovery or surprise that has occurred in your research?\n\nOur understanding of aerosols has evolved a lot since I was a graduate student. At that time, researchers thought that aerosols didn’t even react. The particles might as well have been billiard balls moving back and forth, and were not thought to linger in the atmosphere long enough to affect any chemistry.\n\nI had my white colleagues walk in a Black student’s shoes for a day\n\nWhat we have found since is that the higher the resolution with which you can probe particles in the atmosphere, the more you can learn about them.\n\nThe fact that you have active microbial communities in dust storms was not known at the beginning of my career. A lot of the theories said that the microbes would die instead of being transported, because there’s too much radiation in the atmosphere and not enough moisture. There were all sorts of rationales that had nothing to do with direct observation.\n\nWe focused a lot of effort on going into and tracking dust storms in situ, and taking detailed measurements. We found from direct observations that a lot of the assumptions were just wrong.\n\nHow do you deal with criticism of your diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and anti-racism work?\n\nI have always encountered criticism and scepticism with regards to inclusive practice. I have never allowed uninformed criticism to dictate my response, behaviour or expectations of the outcomes of my efforts.\n\nBut the criticism has been pretty constant.\n\nEstablished leaders in the field were actively against setting up a graduate programme in atmospheric science at Howard. At the time, we were being actively challenged about whether there was significant interest in minoritized communities. Most of the established PhD programmes in atmospheric sciences had never admitted, let alone graduated, more than two African American, Puerto Rican or Native American students. I also think that we were suffering from a ‘three strikes’ prejudicial cynicism: we were all junior faculty members, we were all people of colour and we were at an HBCU, and not an exclusive research university. We were challenged by our critics to find 50 ‘competitive’ graduate students from minoritized communities. We found more than 200, all of whom attended a National Science Foundation-sponsored workshop at Howard.\n\nThe financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States\n\nThere’s always pushback. When I give talks focused on critical analysis of data to show that there’s discrimination or racialization in certain practices and privileges in the scientific community, I’ve had people try to disrupt my presentations. When that happens, it’s mostly on me to stop the disruption because other people don’t usually intervene.\n\nBut I was bussed to school, aged 7, as part of efforts to reduce segregation by moving pupils around, and people were spitting at us and throwing trash. My parents were lifelong activists who led strikes, marches and protests. As an undergraduate in the 1980s, I took part in civil-rights demonstrations in Forsyth County, Georgia, at which people were hit in the head with rocks and bottles. I worked for the Voter Education Project in South Georgia to register Black and rural voters, and was literally run out of town. I’ve seen how bad it can get.\n\nSo, if someone’s trying to ask me a ‘gotcha’ question at a conference or a talk, it’s typically not going to get worse than that. It’s aimed at trying to intimidate or silence me, and I don’t intimidate easily.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a 20-something researcher in your field?\n\nTry to find the enjoyment in the creation or advancement of knowledge. Relishing the life of the mind is important. Don’t let someone else define your success for you.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Vernon Morris was the first African American to earn a PhD in Earth and atmospheric sciences in 1991. At that time, very few Black scientists worked in this field, and opportunities for them were limited.\n\n**What happened** – In 2001, Morris started the first PhD program in atmospheric sciences at Howard University, a historically Black college. This program has helped produce half of all African American and nearly a third of all Latinx PhD graduates in this science in the US between 2006 and 2018. Morris also studies how dust and tiny particles travel through the air, affecting weather and ecosystems.\n\n**Impact** – Morris’s program gave many minority students a chance to study and succeed in atmospheric sciences, a field where they were previously underrepresented. His research helps improve weather forecasts and shows how dust can carry microbes across continents, affecting the environment in surprising ways. He has mentored over 200 students of color and worked to fight racism in science.\n\n**What's next step** – Morris continues to lead efforts for diversity and inclusion at Arizona State University. His anti-racism initiative, called No Time for Silence, invites scientists to actively support fairness in their work. The program at Howard University serves as a model that other schools might follow to increase diversity in STEM fields.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Vernon Morris has transformed atmospheric science by creating educational opportunities for Black scientists and leading research that connects air particles to global environmental health.\n",

Both consider short-term rentals for tourist purposes to be a problem.\n\nVienna (APA) – The EU Commissioner for Energy and Housing, the Dane Dan Jørgensen, on Friday described Vienna’s housing policy as a model. It could serve as an inspiration for other cities, he said after a meeting with Vienna’s mayor Michael Ludwig – at which Jørgensen presented the EU plan for affordable housing. Europe is facing a housing crisis that is also a social crisis, the EU Commissioner warned.\n\nSo far, the issue has not been particularly high on the agenda of the European Union, the guest emphasized. That has now changed. After all, millions of citizens are affected and cannot live in adequate housing. For example, everyone should be able to live near their place of work, which is becoming increasingly difficult in many cities.\n\nCreating housing as a challenge\n\n“The EU is also there for people’s concerns,” Jørgensen assured. When it comes to housing, Vienna has been a model for more than 100 years. Mayor Ludwig, in turn, expressed his satisfaction that the EU is taking up the issue and has now also set up a department for it. The Commission’s plan for affordable housing is also important: “It is a first strong move.”\n\nJørgensen and Ludwig agreed that, above all, the creation of housing – even in times of tight budgets – is necessary. According to the EU Commission, around 650,000 apartments would have to be built in the Union in addition to the current level of around 1.6 million units. The additional properties would cost around 150 billion euros, it was said today.\n\nNo privatizations in Vienna\n\nThe mayor further reaffirmed that there are no plans for privatizations. No municipal apartments are being sold; instead, new ones are even being built, he stressed. In addition, it is also about creating framework conditions for the commercial sector.\n\nBoth considered short-term rentals of apartments for tourist purposes to be a problem. Ludwig expressed his conviction that Vienna is also setting a good example here. He pointed out that apartments may only be offered on the platforms for a maximum of 90 days per year.\n\nWith regard to a possible vacancy tax, however, he was skeptical. Expectations should not be set too high here. It is difficult to check or define vacancy, Ludwig cautioned. (19.12.2025)\n\nThe editorial responsibility for publication lies with APA.",
