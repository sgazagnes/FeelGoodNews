      "content": "The rats scurried into the shed. Flinching at the sound of a horde of tiny claws scratching at the ground, Migdalia Mass Llorens kept vigil over her sleeping family huddled together under a single blanket. The 35-year-old mother of three couldn’t bring herself to join her kids in peaceful slumber. The hard floor and the rodents were bad enough. There was also the sinking awareness that her family may no longer have a home to return to that kept her up well into the night.\n\nIt was late September 2017, and Hurricane Maria had just roared through Puerto Rico. The catastrophic storm came just weeks after Hurricane Irma swept through the archipelago. When Maria hit, the family was sheltering inside their wooden house, which they had tied down with wire cables in the hopes it would hold. But the cables were no match for the 155 mph winds: In the middle of the night, the cords snapped and the roof flew off, letting in a deluge of rain. During the eye of the storm, the terrified family ran out the front door and to a tiny cinder-block shed still under construction on their farm. Torrents of water joined the rodents creeping in through holes in the structure.\n\nIn the daylight, the Mass Llorenses emerged to find their house flattened — one of many in the rural agricultural municipality of Las Marías, tucked high up in the Cordillera Central mountain range on the main island’s west coast, destroyed by the storm.\n\n“When the storm passed, we went outside and realized we had nothing left,” said Mass Llorens in Spanish. They picked through the wreckage to gather what they could, before she and her husband moved their children into the half-built shed — meant to store farm tools and crops, not people. “We lost everything. We cried.”\n\nA woman pulls a trash can past a home destroyed by Hurricane Maria.\n\nRicardo Arduengo / AFP via Getty Images\n\nAfter shelter, hunger quickly became the biggest concern for Mass Llorens and her family. At first, she harvested the scores of breadfruit and bananas that had fallen from their trees during the hurricane. Then she salvaged tins of Spam and sausages, boxes of crackers, and bags of rice from the rubble of her home. They had scarce other options. The Category 4 storm had isolated their rural community from rescue and relief efforts. Landslides and floods washed away roads and downed trees, and mounds of debris blocked the routes that remained.\n\nAs the days bled into weeks, with both electricity and cell tower communications still offline, the Mass Llorens family passed the time by beginning the slow, arduous process of cleaning up their land. Piece by piece — broken kitchen chair by shattered dish — they methodically cleared the debris into heaping piles of trash.\n\nTime itself soon became another thing to contend with: Some of their food started to spoil. The rats also seemed to be getting hungrier — and braver. Before nightfall every day, the family had to pile their cache of food on a rotted wooden table and fight them off by hand. It was then that Mass Llorens realized that help would be a long way off.\n\n“I was afraid of having nothing, of running out of food… it was horrible,” she said. “The help just didn’t come. It just didn’t arrive.”\n\nIn the wake of Maria, a hunger crisis set in across Puerto Rico. But the food and water shortages preceded the hurricane.\n\nCarolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nWhat happened to the Mass Llorens family was part of the hunger and humanitarian crisis that engulfed much of Puerto Rico after Maria. It would take nearly a year for power to be restored to all residents, the longest blackout in U.S. history. The sheer destruction of the storm resulted in bottlenecks of emergency aid distribution, including issues like a shortage of truckers, the loss of virtually all cell communication, and extensive infrastructure damage. The government response to Maria was horribly unequal when compared to similar situations.\n\nAt the same time, the food and water shortages experienced by millions of Puerto Ricans were also linked to the island’s staggering rate of food insecurity that preceded the hurricane — and that still persist today. Roughly 41 percent of the population currently lives below the poverty line, and up to one-third is believed to be food-insecure — which is nearly four times the average throughout the continental U.S.\n\nIn the wake of Maria, many residents of Puerto Rico, especially those working to improve the archipelago’s local food system, began to think about hurricane preparedness differently. Because they weren’t able to rely on federal assistance, they decided to build their own prototypes of resilience, which didn’t just set them up to be ready for the next storm, but also set them up to live better everyday lives. Cooperatives, gardens, and school-based agricultural programs emerged to fill the gaps left by the government. Barter networks and local farmers markets have become increasingly popular. Mutual-aid kitchens and community-led supermarkets have also expanded their work, ramping up donations, surplus food, and partnerships with nearby producers. These projects aren’t just temporary disaster responses. They are models of long-term resilience and food independence. They are living blueprints of what food sovereignty could look like in Puerto Rico — and elsewhere.\n\nAfter Maria, many residents began to think about hurricane preparedness and their food system differently.

Communities throughout Puerto Rico are now gearing up for the one-two punch.\n\n“Puerto Rico’s food system does not exist in a vacuum,” said David Josué Carrasquillo Medrano, executive director of the San Juan-based nonprofit Planifiquemos who also served on the Department of Agriculture’s Equity Commission during the Biden administration. The “food-secure, climate-resilient, economically just” future of Puerto Rico, he added, “requires breaking the policy cage that has kept it vulnerable for too long.”\n\nA U.S. soldier hands out bottled water, provided by FEMA, to residents of Puerto Rico.\n\nMario Tama / Getty Images\n\nPuerto Rico is overly reliant on imported food, which history shows can quickly spiral into a crisis of accessibility when a bout of extreme weather strikes, power is knocked out, and a group of islands home to more than 3 million people becomes entirely dependent on outside aid shipped in by sea and by air for survival. Many experts say that this situation was spurred by one pivotal policy: the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, colloquially known as the Jones Act, which bars international maritime vessels from shipping goods between U.S. coasts — meaning that merchandise traveling between U.S. ports must be delivered on vessels owned and operated by Americans. Some analysts have argued that this law has had the effect of ticking up shipping costs and making it less possible over time for Puerto Rican farmers to compete with U.S. mainland food manufacturers. Others have questioned the true impact of the Jones Act on the archipelago’s food sovereignty. A 2012 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York noted that “to the extent that it inhibits free trade, the Jones Act does indeed have a negative effect on the Puerto Rican economy, although the magnitude of the effect is unclear.”\n\nThe Jones Act, however, wasn’t the only policy to contribute to Puerto Rico’s broken food system. In the 1930s and ’40s, a series of local economic regulations directed at the sugar cane industry led to the demise of what was once the archipelago’s most common agricultural product and its largest source of revenue. From there, the U.S. territory’s reliance on imports steadily climbed. In the 1980s, Puerto Rico grew around 45 percent of its own food; today that number is around 15 percent.\n\nDeclining local agricultural production only deepened Puerto Ricans’ dependency on external supply chains. From 1992 to 2007, the number of farms decreased by 30 percent, the amount of land being farmed decreased by 33 percent, and total livestock and poultry products sold dropped by nearly 19 percent. The agriculture sector also lost roughly a third of workers. In 2006, an economic recession gripped Puerto Rico. Nearly 20 years later, that recession has not abated.\n\nShortly after Hurricane Maria, Republican senators John McCain and Mike Lee introduced a bill seeking to repeal the Jones Act, which they said was hindering the island’s recovery process by limiting the flow of maritime emergency aid shipments. McCain, who had long championed ending the policy, called it an “antiquated, protectionist law that has driven up costs and crippled Puerto Rico’s economy.”\n\nThough McCain and Lee’s legislative efforts were unsuccessful, President Donald Trump temporarily suspended the law at the request of Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló. The suspension expired in early October 2017, just two weeks after the storm, and made little difference for Puerto Ricans. According to a Brookings Institution report from that year, the law, and its waiver, didn’t contribute to the larger relief issues at play; there were other, more consequential factors — “The key problems, including insufficient and delayed federal resources, and a lack of means to distribute supplies on the island, have nothing to do with the Jones Act.”\n\nA worker sorts live chickens from dead ones in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

The cataclysmic hurricane set the organization down a new path.\n\nThey distributed emergency water filtration stations, installed rainwater harvesting tanks at elderly residents’ homes, and collaborated with local doctors to hold health clinics. The experience sparked a new awareness for Ingley — that something was missing. The Las Marías community needed a physical place, stocked with critical recovery resources, where they could go to get support after a disaster like a hurricane.\n\n“It was a really defining moment for our organization,” said Ingley. “There’s some comfort in having hot, prepared, healthy meals after a hurricane, having access to a warm plate of food, cooked with love, with healthy, local ingredients. I think there’s a health benefit, and I think there’s an emotional, psychological benefit to it also.”\n\nMeanwhile, life became exceedingly difficult for Migdalia Mass Llorens and her family. About a month after the storm, her youngest son, José, was stung by a scorpion. Mass Llorens herself contracted leptospirosis, a rat-borne disease. For roughly 60 days, the breadfruit and bananas available on the farm and a dwindling stash of canned goods were about all they ate. When first responders and government officials finally showed up, nearly three months after Maria made landfall, hand-delivering boxes of bottled water and ready-to-eat meals, Mass Llorens felt a sense of overwhelming relief. Then the frustration hit. She wondered: Why had it taken them so long? Why was her community, her family, left to fend for themselves? In that moment, she knew she never wanted to be in that position — waiting for help that didn’t come — again.\n\nAs time went on, life slowly began to retain some normalcy — enough, at least, for José to be sent back to his elementary school. One day, Paoli Garrido, of Plenitud, came to the school to try to make connections with local farmers. José offered her a breadfruit from his parents’ stash. That prompted the team at Plenitud to reach out to Mass Llorens to see if she and her husband, Juan, were interested in participating in the group’s agricultural cooperative.\n\nOver the next year or so, Mass Llorens and Plenitud continued to talk about how they could work together. Mass Llorens was inspired by the concept of community-powered resilience. Plus, she needed to bring in a paycheck after Maria had wiped out their harvest, so in 2020 she eventually signed on to help start and run the community kitchen.\n\nThe Plenitud team was still in search of a site to work from. First, they collected signatures from a little over 200 residents in Alto Sano, a petition they shared with the municipality to permit the nonprofit to launch the kitchen in an abandoned school building. The town leased the half-acre lot to the organization for $120 — paid monthly, $1 at a time over a decade. Plenitud then got to work finding a mix of grant and philanthropic funding that would keep the kitchen open year-round, so that it could ensure food security for some of the area’s most vulnerable residents and double as a disaster resilience hub when the next storm swept through.\n\nPlenitud set itself up to receive donations of surplus nonperishables from a nearby food bank and launched an on-site community garden with crops like lettuce, cilantro, herbs, and peppers. The team secured funding to pay farmers for fresh produce such as breadfruit and jackfruit, with the goal to freeze it all and store bulk amounts of it ahead of hurricane season every year. Staffers set up a rainwater filtration system that could store thousands of gallons of potable water and fundraised to buy dozens of at-home mini filtration systems. They also partnered with other nonprofits to establish off-grid solar to help power the site and acquire solar lights for folks with mobility limitations that would prevent them from evacuating or reaching the center.\n\nBy 2021, Plenitud was ready to open the new facility. It was part kitchen, part food vault, and part community gathering place. They would call it La Cancha Sana — named in honor of the property’s basketball court, or una cancha, and the neighborhood, Alto Sano.\n\n“People saw after Hurricane Maria that the local government just doesn’t have enough resources and enough efficiency to be able to effectively respond,” said Ingley. “We need to come together and be prepared to jump in ourselves. …El pueblo salva al pueblo. The people save the people.”\n\nMigdalia Mass Llorens, left, pictured with another Alto Sano resident the day after Hurricane Fiona blew through their rural community. Unlike after Maria, Mass Llorens and her family had a safe haven. Courtesy of Plenitud PR\n\nLa Cancha Sana had its first big test run when Hurricane Fiona barrelled through Puerto Rico on September 18, 2022, once again knocking out power, triggering mudslides and flash floods, and destroying roads. Just after the storm, a ship sailing under the flag of the Marshall Islands attempted to deliver about 300,000 barrels of fuel to help with the recovery, but it was initially unable to dock because of foreign vessel restrictions mandated by the Jones Act. (It docked several days later after the Department of Homeland Security granted a Jones Act waiver.)\n\nBy then, Plenitud had stored thousands of gallons of filtered rainwater and stockpiled nonperishable food and fresh vegetables from their nearby farm. They had also acquired hundreds of gallons of emergency propane. Unlike after Maria, Mass Llorens and her family had a safe haven; a space to eat, get water, and gather with their community after another storm tore through their lives. She spent the next 21 days at La Cancha Sana cooking, day in and day out. She made plates of rice and beans, cooked squash, guacamole, and fried plantains, a welcome source of nutrition for rural communities like hers still without power. Those days, Mass Llorens said, were a blur.\n\nLa Cancha Sana became part kitchen, part food vault, and part community gathering place. Courtesy of Plenitud PR\n\nThe rest of her family worked with the Plenitud team to deliver food and rainwater harvesting devices to homes in the barrio. They also got the word out: La Cancha Sana had power, and everyone was welcome. Some of Mass Llorens’ colleagues went down to the local farms to help the producers salvage produce like avocados, plantains, and breadfruit that could no longer be sold in markets or shipped anywhere. As the news about La Cancha Sana spread, people filtered in from nearby barrios, too. By the time the power had been restored, three weeks after the storm, they had served around 2,500 meals.\n\n“In hurricanes, in moments of emergency, in the place where we are, a very rural place, we are far from the coast, from the cities. In el campo — the rural areas — we’re left for last,” said Mass Llorens. “Communities really need this kind of support because the government just won’t show up in the way you need. We can’t wait for help to come from outside.”\n\nIn another part of Puerto Rico, a different community developed its own post-Maria solution to its broken local food system — Comedores Sociales de Puerto Rico’s mutual aid kitchen. Courtesy of Comedores Sociales de Puerto Rico\n\nOn the central-eastern side of Puerto Rico’s main island, in the densely populated city Caguas, another resilience center jumped into action as Fiona thundered through. The first iteration of Giovanni Roberto Cáez’s community kitchen was cobbled together in days after Hurricane Maria. Following Fiona, Comedores Sociales de Puerto Rico was running a full-scale mutual aid operation in its own building.\n\nEvery Tuesday for the next month, hundreds of Caguas residents showed up to take home free rice, beans, and canned goods in addition to fresh produce sourced from local farmers. Instead of being given pre-packed food, people were encouraged to choose what they needed or wanted, and invited to participate as a volunteer or donate to the effort if they could.\n\nUnlike Plenitud, and most traditional charitable food businesses, Comedores Sociales doesn’t rely on government money. Instead, it receives philanthropic support, sells merch, hosts concerts, offers catering services, and twice a year hosts community fundraising dinners. “Food is not only a biological need,” said Roberto Cáez. “It’s a cultural need, it’s a social need. Because food brings us together. It puts us at the same table, organizes our communities to harvest together.”\n\nIt is also a matter of politics, he continued. “Its loss, and land, and power, and the companies who control the food. Who has the power to decide those things. And who does not.”\n\n“Food is not only a biological need,” said Giovanni Roberto Cáez, above. “It’s a cultural need, it’s a social need. Because food brings us together. It puts us at the same table, organizes our communities to harvest together.” Courtesy of Comedores Sociales de Puerto Rico\n\nThe lack of coordination from governmental agencies that followed Hurricane Maria led many Puerto Ricans to come to the conclusion that they were on their own, said University of Central Florida disaster sociologist Fernando Rivera — which he said may have, in an ironic twist of fate, prepared them for the reality of sweeping federal disinvestment unfolding now across the U.S.\n\n“There’s a redefining of what the role of the federal government is in everyday life of our people. There’s a profound discussion now of who takes the realms of emergency management, or emergency preparedness,” said Rivera, who has studied disaster response and preparedness in Puerto Rico and Florida. “In a sense, that predisposition of the horrible things that happened after Hurricane Maria actually activated these communities and brought about this knowledge of what we need to do.”\n\nBut Rivera warns that if community-led programs like these end up being successful, and are privately funded, then it could serve as an incentive for federal agencies to retreat even further from the fundamental duties of the government.\n\nEvery Tuesday for the month following Hurricane Fiona, hundreds of Caguas residents showed up at Comedores Sociales de Puerto Rico’s mutual aid kitchen to take home free rice, beans, canned goods, and fresh produce. Courtesy of Comedores Sociales de Puerto Rico\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the speed at which the government processes declarations of major disasters has noticeably slowed down. Trump also terminated $4.5 billion in FEMA grants that helped communities prepare for future disaster damage, though a federal judge recently barred the administration from doing so. This almost certainly does not bode well for Puerto Rico, said Rivera.\n\nThe second Trump term has also resulted in direct cuts to federal funding pots going to Puerto Rico, including the end of roughly $10 million that backed two programs supporting farmers and forest stewards with technical assistance and workforce development tools: Smart Ag Puerto Rico, created to support smallholder coffee and cacao farmers, and conservation initiative Puente Forestal. The former is on hold until further notice; the latter has been cancelled outright. The administration’s cancellation of federal grants supporting food pantries and local food systems has also sparked concern among community organizations that the reductions will have a knock-on effect on Puerto Rico’s disaster recovery efforts — similar to the shortages experienced by food banks responding to the recent floods in Texas. Puerto Rico is also one of three U.S. jurisdictions excluded from the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Instead, the archipelago receives a capped annual block grant through the Nutrition Assistance Program, or NAP, which does not adjust to inflation, population growth — or, notably, disaster impacts.\n\nEven groups like Comedores Sociales that aren’t federally funded are still confronting the consequences of Trump’s considerable policy shifts. Since January, private groups funding the organization’s mutual aid center have begun scaling back their donations, shortening the terms of their agreements, and some individual donors have even suspended their contributions. Comedores Sociales has a runway through the end of next year, but founder Roberto Cáez doesn’t know whether it will have the funding needed to sustain operations beyond then.\n\nIn the case of La Cancha Sana, the federal funding roller coaster is also exacting a toll. Although none of its contracted grants have yet to be canceled, the group gets much of its federal funding through AmeriCorps, which has faced significant cuts in the last eight months. The future of several of their pending grant proposals is also now unclear amid the administration’s slashing and burning of climate justice programs they once relied on for their work.\n\nIngley says his team is taking it one day at time; the main priority right now is continuing to stockpile food and water so Plenitud can best be prepared to feed the community this hurricane season. Some 4,000 gallons of water are currently stored in cisterns at La Cancha Sana, alongside more than 3,000 servings of rice and hundreds of pounds of canned beans, dried nuts, and legumes. Ingley worries it won’t be close to enough.\n\n“I am concerned about facing an even greater need in the event of a hurricane like Maria,” he said. “There’s a sense of burden about not being able to do enough. Our capacity is staying about the same, and the need is just growing more.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused massive damage in Puerto Rico, leaving millions without power or food for months. The island already had serious problems with poverty and hunger before the storm, making recovery even harder.\n\n**What happened** – After Maria, many Puerto Ricans decided to take action themselves since government help was slow and limited. Groups like Plenitud PR created community kitchens and food centers stocked with local produce and emergency supplies. These places also provide clean water and a safe space during storms. For example, La Cancha Sana in Alto Sano served thousands of meals after Hurricane Fiona in 2022, helping families who lost power and access to food.\n\n**Impact** – These community-led efforts are different from short-term aid. They focus on long-term food independence and disaster readiness. By growing local food, sharing resources, and supporting each other, neighborhoods are becoming stronger and more prepared. This helps reduce hunger and improves daily life, especially in rural areas often left behind during emergencies.\n\n**What's next step** – Groups like Plenitud PR are working to keep their food centers open and stocked for future storms. They face challenges like less government funding and growing needs, but they continue building resilience through partnerships and local support. Their work could inspire other communities to create similar systems.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Puerto Rican communities are creating lasting, local food networks and emergency hubs that help them recover faster and live better after hurricanes.\n\n",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nAmid a challenging retail climate, one familiar sight on British high streets is not just surviving but thriving. Waterstones, the country’s largest bookshop chain, is finding renewed momentum as young adults reach for books as a wholesome alternative to endless scrolling.\n\nCEO James Daunt says the stores’ success comes down to creating “a place which is an enjoyable and effective way to buy books.” With 320 UK locations and heritage names like Foyles, Hatchards, and Blackwell’s under its wing, the chain is proving that brick-and-mortar bookshops can still inspire in a digital age.\n\nA cultural nudge from BookTok\n\nOne factor behind the surge is the influence of social media trends. BookTok, which is the community of readers sharing recommendations on TikTok, has nudged countless younger adults back to paperbacks. “They want to do something not staring at a screen and relatively inexpensive,” Daunt explains, adding that once people begin collecting books, “they just buy more.”\n\nHe’s quick to note that this isn’t just about TikTok itself but about a wider craving: “This is about people wanting to read and talk about books.” Whether it’s romance, fantasy, or the newer “romantasy,” certain genres have caught imaginations and sparked waves of readers back into shops.\n\nFiction on the rise\n\nFigures support the trend. Fiction sales across the UK jumped more than 12 percent last year, according to the Publishers Association, and Waterstones reports that the boom has carried into 2025. This growth has helped balance out dips in nonfiction and children’s books, even as overall print sales declined slightly while digital formats climbed by 17 percent.\n\nParents also remain a driving force, bringing children into stores to nurture a love of reading. Waterstones has leaned into that role, redesigning shops with cafés and displays curated by local booksellers to make them welcoming community spaces.\n\nMore doors opening\n\nRather than retreating, Waterstones is expanding, adding 10 new stores a year in the UK. Some of the latest are inside John Lewis department stores, in places like Cheadle and Bluewater, following the success of its Oxford Street branch. The company has also opened outlets in Next stores, aiming to meet shoppers where they already are.\n\nImportantly, the chain has held on to locations in towns where other retailers pulled out. Daunt points to Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria as an example, where Waterstones stayed even when others left, and is now seeing new energy in the community. “If you stay in these places the pendulum does swing back,” he says.\n\nA transatlantic chapter\n\nWaterstones is also part of a larger story. Its parent group owns Barnes & Noble in the United States, where Daunt also serves as CEO. There, the rebound is even stronger after years of heavy losses in independent bookshops. Barnes & Noble now plans to open 60 new stores annually, drawing on lessons learned in the UK about empowering booksellers and building inviting spaces.\n\nA wholesome escape\n\nAt its heart, the growth of Waterstones tells a simple, reassuring story: people are still drawn to the tactile, communal joy of books. For younger adults in particular, reading has become both an affordable escape and a way to connect offline. In a world saturated with screens, it’s a trend that feels not just wholesome but hopeful.",

      "summary": "The new commercial partnerships aim, as stated, to create \"export opportunities worth billions of euros for European businesses of all sizes.\"",
      "content": "The new commercial partnerships aim, as stated, to create “export opportunities worth billions of euros for European businesses of all sizes.”\n\nThe European Commission today presented the proposals it submitted to the Council for the signing and conclusion of the EU-Mercosur Partnership Agreement (EMPA) and the Modernized EU-Mexico Global Agreement (MGA). “These historic agreements are a crucial part of the EU’s strategy to diversify its trade relations and strengthen economic and political ties with like-minded partners around the world,” according to the Commission.\n\nThe new data and benefits\n\nThe new trade partnerships presented today by Kaja Kallas, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, and Maroš Šefčovič, European Commissioner for Trade, aim to “create trade and social export opportunities worth billions of euros for European businesses of all sizes, contribute to economic growth and competitiveness, support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, and promote the interests and values of the EU.” At the same time, these agreements, in a period of increasing geopolitical instability, connect the EU more closely “with strategically important partners, offering a common platform to enhance mutual trust and address common global challenges, including the modernization of the rules-based global trading system,” according to the Commissioner.\n\nEU-Mercosur Agreement\n\nIncrease in annual exports by up to 39%\n\nThe agreement with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay will create the largest free trade area in the world, and European businesses will be able to benefit from lower tariffs in a region where most other countries face high tariffs and other trade barriers, according to the Trade Commissioner. It is estimated that the agreement could increase the EU’s annual exports to Mercosur by up to 39% (i.e., €49 billion), supporting more than 440,000 jobs across Europe. It will reduce the often prohibitive tariffs in these countries for EU exports, including key industrial products such as cars (currently subject to a 35% tariff), machinery (14-20%), and pharmaceuticals (up to 14%).\n\nFood exports and safety valves\n\nEU agri-food exports to Mercosur are expected to increase by nearly 50%, as the agreement reduces high tariffs on key EU products, particularly wine and spirits (up to 35%), chocolate (20%), and olive oil (10%). The agreement will also support the development of exports of traditional, high-quality EU agri-food products. Furthermore, it will put an end to unfair competition from Mercosur products that mimic authentic European products, protecting 344 European Geographical Indications.\n\nThe Commission proposes that this agreement be accompanied by a legal act, with bilateral safety valves to protect sensitive aspects of the EU agricultural sector. Specifically, first, it limits preferential imports of agri-food products from the Mercosur agreement to a small percentage of EU production (for example, 1.5% for beef and 1.3% for poultry). Second, it establishes strong safety valves that protect sensitive European products from any harmful increase in imports. The legal agreement, which will be discussed with the Mercosur countries, must be approved by the European Parliament and the Council.\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, emphasized among other things that “European businesses and the EU’s agri-food sector will directly benefit from lower tariffs and lower costs, contributing to economic growth and job creation.”\n\nIn the agri-food sector, the Commission will proceed with a series of accompanying initiatives, including steps towards possible harmonization of production standards regarding pesticides and animal welfare applicable to imported products, emphasizing that “EU health and food safety standards will continue to apply to all products available on the EU market – whether produced within the Union or imported.”\n\nAdditionally, as the Commission announced, the proposal for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) after 2027 includes a guaranteed budget of at least €300 billion for income support, ensuring that European farmers continue to receive strong and stable financial support. The Commission is also introducing the new “Unity Safety Net” for crisis measures, with a total funding capacity of €6.3 billion, doubling the current reserve for the agricultural sector.\n\nEU-Mexico Trade Agreement\n\nThe initial EU-Mexico trade agreement dates back to 2000, and according to the Commission, every year, the EU exports goods and services worth over €70 billion to Mexico. The new agreement “aims to further economic development as Mexico is a purely importing country in the food sector, making the agreement particularly beneficial for European agricultural exporters.”\n\nWhat it provides\n\nThe modernized EU-Mexico agreement will eliminate the remaining prohibitive tariffs on EU agri-food exports, such as cheese, poultry, pork, pasta, apples, jams, as well as chocolate and wine. The elimination of these tariffs, which currently reach up to 100% on certain European products, will make them much more competitive in Mexico. Additionally, streamlined processes will make selling these products in the Mexican market faster and cheaper for exporters. The agreement also extends protection against counterfeiting, with geographical indications, to 568 iconic products.\n\nThe modernized agreement will also ensure critical access to important raw materials, which will benefit strategic industrial sectors in Europe. Mexico is a key supplier of specific materials used in various chemical processes, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, as well as batteries.\n\nThe next steps\n\nThe agreements require separate approval from the European Parliament and separate ratification by the member states before they come into force. Additionally, the Commission’s proposals include two parallel legal documents for each agreement, which must be approved by the European Parliament and the EU Council. (3/9/25)",

The refurbishment of Big Ben - officially known as the Elizabeth Tower - is among the six nominees for the Royal Institute of British Architects' Stirling Prize. The list also includes the London College of Fashion campus on the former Olympic Park in east London and AstraZeneca's medical research centre in Cambridge. They are joined by the \"pioneering\" Appleby Blue Almshouse retirement home and the Japanese-inspired Niwa House, both in south London, and an extension to an \"eccentric\" home in Hastings.\n\nThe Elizabeth line - London's east-west train line - won the prestigious award last year.\n\nHufton + Crow The Elizabeth line won last year's Stirling Prize\n\nThe prize is given to the building judged to be \"the most significant of the year for the evolution of architecture and the built environment\", and is judged on criteria including design vision, innovation and originality. It is usually given to a brand new building, but can also go to major restorations and renovations.

Each offers \"a blueprint for how architecture can enrich society\", and they show a \"hopeful vision for the future, one where architecture strengthens communities and helps shape a more sustainable and inclusive built environment\", he added.\n\nAppleby Blue Almshouse by Witherford Watson Mann Architects\n\nPhilip Vile\n\nThis social housing development, with 57 flats for over-65s, in Southwark, south London, replaced an abandoned care home, and is billed as a modern version of the traditional almshouse. The design is intended to \"foster community and reduce isolation among residents\", Riba said, with communal areas and shared facilities including a kitchen and double-height garden room. \"The result is a new standard for inclusive social housing in later life.\"\n\nElizabeth Tower by Purcell\n\nHouse of Commons\n\nThe Elizabeth Tower is one of London's best-known landmarks and is often known as Big Ben - although that's actually the name of the bell that produces the famous bongs. The most extensive works to the tower in its 160-year history included repairs to the clock mechanism; changes to the colour scheme on the four clock faces to put back the Victorian blue and gold; and reinstating St George's Cross flag emblems. Accessibility improvements include a new lift. The result is described as \"a veritable masterclass in conservation and craftsmanship\" by the judges - although it came at a cost, going way over its original budget, which was estimated at £29m to £45m.\n\nHastings House by Hugh Strange Architects\n\nRory Gaylor\n\nThis late 19th Century detached hillside house in the East Sussex town has been extended with a series of timber-framed rooms and industrial exterior features including a concrete yard and galvanised steel staircase. \"The result goes beyond a house extension, transforming the entire home and producing a lesson in restrained, inventive reuse,\" the judges said.\n\nLondon College of Fashion by Allies and Morrison\n\nSimon Menges\n\nThe college previously had six buildings but the 6,000 students and staff moved to the new 17-storey headquarters in the Queen Elizabeth Park in Stratford, east London, in 2023. Judges approvingly noted features including its \"dramatic staircases unfurling through a shared 'heart space' to encourage collaboration\".\n\nNiwa House by Takero Shimazaki Architects\n\nFelix Koch\n\nThis home, described as a \"pavilion-like oasis\", was built on a previously derelict plot behind a row of terraced houses in south London for a family with a love of Japanese design. It was also designed to be accessible for a wheelchair-using resident. \"The quality of light throughout the home is breathtaking,\" the judges said. \"Large full-height sliding doors and full-height glazed walls seamlessly blend indoors and out – opening spaces to gardens, courtyards and balconies. It is difficult to see where the building ends and the gardens begin.\"\n\nThe Discovery Centre by Herzog and de Meuron/BDP\n\nHufton+Crow\n\nMedicine giant AstraZeneca's Discovery Centre \"radically redefines the research facility\", according to Riba, \"blending cutting-edge laboratories with welcoming public spaces\". The striking building has a curved three-sided shape, with a high, jagged exterior glass front and roof. Inside, three glass-lined labs are linked by \"clever interconnecting corridors that balance stringent security with transparency, putting science on display\".",
