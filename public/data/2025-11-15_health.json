      "title": "Scientists reverse kidney damage in mice, hope for humans next",
      "summary": "Researchers uncovered how fatty molecules called ceramides trigger acute kidney injury by damaging the mitochondria that power kidney cells. By altering ceramide metabolism or using a new drug candidate, the team was able to protect mitochondrial function and completely prevent kidney injury in mice.",
      "content": "Serious injury to short-term kidney function, known as acute kidney injury (AKI), can be life-threatening and also raise the likelihood of developing permanent chronic kidney disease. AKI can occur after major stressors such as sepsis or heart surgery, and more than half of all intensive care patients experience it. No approved medications currently exist to treat this condition.\n\nResearchers at University of Utah Health (U of U Health) have discovered that fatty molecules called ceramides initiate AKI by damaging the mitochondria that supply energy to kidney cells. By using a backup drug candidate designed to alter how ceramides are processed, the team protected mitochondrial structure and prevented kidney injury in mice.\n\n\"We completely reversed the pathology of acute kidney injury by inactivating ceramides,\" says Scott Summers, PhD, distinguished professor and Chair of the Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology in the University of Utah College of Health and senior author on the study. \"We were stunned -- not only did kidney function stay normal, but the mitochondria were unscathed,\" Summers says. \"It was truly remarkable.\"\n\nThe results are published in Cell Metabolism.\n\nCeramide spikes may serve as an early warning\n\nEarlier studies from the Summers lab showed that ceramides can harm organs such as the heart and liver. When the researchers measured ceramides in AKI models, they found a strong connection: levels rose sharply after injury in both mice and in human urine samples.\n\n\"Ceramide levels are very elevated in kidney injury,\" says Rebekah Nicholson, PhD, first author on the work, who completed the research as a graduate student in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the Arc Institute. \"They go up quickly after damage to the kidneys, and they go up in relation to the severity of the injury. The worse the kidney injury is, the higher the ceramide levels will be.\"\n\nThese findings indicate that urinary ceramides could act as an early biomarker for AKI, giving clinicians a tool to identify vulnerable patients, including those preparing for heart surgery, before symptoms begin. \"If patients are undergoing a procedure that we know puts them at high risk of AKI, then we can better predict whether or not they're actually going to have one,\" Nicholson says.\n\nAltering ceramide production protects kidney function\n\nThe team nearly eliminated kidney injury in a mouse model by modifying the genetic program that controls ceramide production. This change produced \"super mice\" that did not develop AKI even under conditions that typically cause severe damage.\n\nThe researchers then tested a ceramide-lowering drug candidate created by Centaurus Therapeutics, a company co-founded by Summers. Mice treated ahead of time avoided kidney injury, maintained normal kidney function, remained active, and had kidneys that appeared close to normal under the microscope. Nicholson notes that their model places extreme stress on the kidneys, making it \"really remarkable that mice were protected from the injury.\"\n\n\"These mice looked incredible,\" Summers adds.\n\nThe team found that ceramides harm mitochondria, the parts of the cell responsible for energy production. Damaged mitochondria in kidney cells become distorted and function poorly. Adjusting ceramide production, whether genetically or with the drug, kept mitochondria intact and working even under strain.\n\nPotential for future therapies targeting mitochondrial health\n\nSummers explains that the compound used in this study is closely related to, but not identical to, the ceramide-lowering drug that has entered human clinical testing. He emphasizes that mouse results do not always predict human outcomes and that further research is needed to confirm safety.\n\n\"We're thrilled by how protective this backup compound was, but it's still preclinical,\" Summers says. \"We need to be cautious and do our due diligence to make sure this approach is truly safe before moving it into patients.\"\n\nEven so, the researchers are encouraged by the findings. If the results extend to people, the drug could potentially be administered ahead of time to individuals who face a high risk of AKI, including patients undergoing heart surgery, where about one quarter experience the condition.\n\nBecause the drug appears to work by maintaining mitochondrial health, the team believes that the approach may have relevance for other disorders linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\n\"Mitochondrial problems show up in so many diseases -- heart failure, diabetes, fatty liver disease,\" Summers says. \"So if we can truly restore mitochondrial health, the implications could be enormous.\"\n\nThe results are published in Cell Metabolism as \"Therapeutic Remodeling of the Ceramide Backbone Prevents Kidney Injury.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nThis work was supported by a NCRR Shared Instrument Grant, the Kidney Precision Medicine Project, and several branches of the National Institutes of Health, including the National Cancer Institute (P30CA042014, CA272529), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (DK115824, DK116888, DK116450, DK130296, DK108833, DK112826, 1F31DK134088 and 5T32DK091317), and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (3R35GM131854 and 3R35GM131854-04S1).

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious condition that can happen after events like heart surgery or infections. It causes sudden kidney damage and can lead to long-term kidney problems. Right now, there are no approved medicines to treat AKI, which affects many patients in intensive care.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of Utah Health found that fatty molecules called ceramides damage the parts of kidney cells that produce energy, called mitochondria. By changing how ceramides are made or using a new drug, they protected the mitochondria and completely stopped kidney injury in mice. These mice stayed healthy even under conditions that usually cause severe kidney damage.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it shows a clear way to prevent AKI by controlling ceramide levels. The team also found that ceramide levels rise quickly after kidney injury, which means measuring ceramides in urine could help doctors detect AKI early. Protecting mitochondria helps keep kidney cells working well, which might also help treat other diseases involving energy problems in cells.\n\n**What's next step** – The drug tested in mice is similar to one already being studied in humans, but more research is needed to make sure it is safe and effective for people. If successful, this treatment could be given to patients at high risk of AKI, such as those undergoing heart surgery, to prevent kidney damage before it happens.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have found a way to stop kidney injury in mice by blocking harmful fat molecules, opening the door for new treatments and early detection methods in humans.",

      "title": "CRISPR brings back ancient gene that prevents gout and fatty liver",
      "summary": "By reactivating a long-lost gene, researchers were able to lower uric acid levels and stop damaging fat accumulation in human liver models. The breakthrough hints at a future where gout and several metabolic diseases could be prevented at the genetic level.",
      "content": "Gout is one of the oldest documented human illnesses. It develops when sharp crystals form inside joints, triggering intense swelling and pain, and is considered a type of arthritis. Researchers at Georgia State University believe they may have uncovered a surprisingly ancient way to address it.\n\nA study in Scientific Reports describes how scientists used CRISPR gene-editing tools to restore a gene that disappeared from the human lineage millions of years ago. Bringing this gene back lowered uric acid, the substance responsible for gout and several other health problems.\n\nThe long-lost component is uricase, an enzyme that most other animals continue to carry.\n\nUricase breaks down uric acid, a waste product that routinely forms in the blood. If uric acid levels rise too much, it can crystallize in the joints and kidneys, causing gout, kidney disease and a number of related conditions.\n\nWhy Humans Lost Uricase\n\nHumans and other apes shed the uricase gene roughly 20 to 29 million years in the past. Some experts argue this change may have once offered an advantage. According to research cited in Seminars in Nephrology, scientists including Dr. Richard Johnson of the University of Colorado have suggested that elevated uric acid helped early primates convert fruit sugars into fat, providing a survival boost during lean times.\n\nToday, however, that ancient adaptation contributes to a range of modern metabolic issues. This is the challenge that Georgia State biology professor Eric Gaucher and his team aimed to test.\n\n\"Without uricase, humans are left vulnerable,\" said Gaucher, a co-author of the study. \"We wanted to see what would happen if we reactivated the broken gene.\"\n\nReintroducing an Ancient Gene With CRISPR\n\nWorking with postdoctoral researcher Lais de Lima Balico, Gaucher relied on CRISPR-Cas9, often referred to as molecular scissors, to insert a reconstructed version of the ancient uricase gene into human liver cells. This allowed the team to observe how the enzyme functioned in a modern biological environment.\n\nThe results surprised them. Uric acid levels fell sharply, and liver cells no longer accumulated fat when exposed to fructose. Because experiments in individual cells cannot always predict what will occur in more complex systems, the researchers advanced to a more sophisticated model.\n\nThey tested the gene in 3D liver spheroids, which are small, lab-grown structures that more closely resemble actual organ function. The reintroduced uricase gene again reduced uric acid. The enzyme also moved into peroxisomes, the cellular compartments where uricase naturally operates, suggesting the therapy might behave safely and appropriately in living organisms.\n\n\"By reactivating uricase in human liver cells, we lowered uric acid and stopped the cells from turning excess fructose into triglycerides -- the fats that build up in the liver,\" Gaucher said.\n\nThe Wider Impact of High Uric Acid\n\nThe findings extend well beyond gout. High uric acid, known as hyperuricemia, is associated with many modern health disorders. Research highlighted in the journal Hypertension has linked elevated uric acid to hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and the risks have been compared to those of high cholesterol.\n\nThese concerns are reflected in patient statistics. Between one-quarter and one-half of people with high blood pressure also have high uric acid, and in newly diagnosed hypertension, that overlap rises to 90 percent, according to the study.\n\n\"Hyperuricemia is a dangerous condition,\" Gaucher said. \"By lowering uric acid, we could potentially prevent multiple diseases at once.\"\n\nToward Future Therapies\n\nCurrent treatments for gout are not effective for everyone, and some individuals experience adverse reactions to existing uricase-based medications. A CRISPR method that restores uricase directly in liver cells could avoid these issues.\n\n\"Our genome-editing approach could allow patients to live gout-free lives and potentially prevent fatty liver disease,\" Gaucher said.\n\nAnimal studies are the next step, followed by human trials if early results hold up. Potential delivery methods include direct injections, returning modified liver cells to patients, or using lipid nanoparticles (the same technology employed in some COVID-19 vaccines).\n\nIf the strategy proves safe, Gaucher believes it could reshape the way gout and related metabolic disorders are treated. However, several challenges still need to be addressed.\n\n\"Genome-editing still faces substantial safety concerns,\" he said. \"Once those are addressed, society will be faced with contentious ethical discussions about who should and should not have access.\"",

      "title": "Scientists find a molecule that mimics exercise and slows aging",
      "summary": "Exercise appears to spark a whole-body anti-aging cascade, and scientists have now mapped out how it happens—and how a simple oral compound can mimic it. By following volunteers through rest, intense workouts, and endurance training, researchers found that the kidneys act as the hidden command center, flooding the body with a metabolite called betaine that restores balance, rejuvenates immune cells, and cools inflammation. Even more striking, giving betaine on its own reproduced many benefits of long-term training, from sharper cognition to calmer inflammation.",
      "content": "A new study in the journal Cell from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University explains how exercise helps the body stay youthful. The researchers also highlight betaine -- a metabolite produced in the kidney -- as an oral compound that can imitate many of the rejuvenating effects normally linked to physical activity.\n\nBetaine is a small molecule found in foods like beets and spinach, but the body also makes it on its own. In this study, it emerged as an important signal that helps coordinate the anti-aging benefits of long-term exercise.\n\nHow the Body Responds to Exercise\n\nThe research team followed 13 healthy men over six years to observe how the body reacts to both short-term and long-term exercise. Using multiomics tools that track genes, proteins, metabolites, and gut bacteria, the scientists compared the body at rest, after a single 5 km run, and after a 25-day running program.\n\nTheir results showed that the kidney plays a central role in managing the body's response to exercise. During sustained training, the kidney produced large increases in betaine, which helped send protective, anti-aging signals throughout the body.\n\nSolving the Exercise Paradox\n\nThe study also helps explain the \"exercise paradox,\" where a single intense workout causes stress but long-term training improves overall health. A short run triggered temporary inflammation and \"metabolic chaos,\" while regular training restored balance and strengthened the immune system.\n\nConsistent exercise improved gut bacteria, boosted antioxidant defenses, and reversed age-related changes in T cells by stabilizing DNA and adjusting epigenetic marks such as reducing ETS1 expression. The kidney also increased its production of betaine through activity of the enzyme CHDH. Remarkably, giving betaine alone created many of the same benefits as training, including better metabolism, improved cognitive function, reduced depressive-like behavior in older mice, and lower inflammation across the body.\n\nHow Betaine Reduces Inflammation\n\nThe researchers found that betaine binds to and blocks TBK1, a kinase that drives inflammation. By suppressing TBK1 and its downstream IRF3/NF-κB pathways, betaine helps silence chronic inflammation, also known as \"inflammaging.\"\n\nThis mechanism ties together the exercise paradox: short-term activity triggers survival pathways (IL-6/corticosterone), while long-term training activates the kidney-betaine-TBK1 system that promotes youthfulness. Because betaine is considered safe and effective, it may be useful for people who cannot exercise regularly. \"This redefines 'exercise as medicine',\" says co-corresponding author Dr. Liu Guang-Hui. \"This study gives us a fresh way to turn how our body works into something we can target with chemicals. It opens the door to geroprotective treatments that can tweak how multiple organs work together.\"",

      "title": "COP30: Climate crisis is a health crisis, WHO warns as philanthropies pledge $300m for solutions",
      "summary": "Climate change is already fueling a global health emergency, killing more than half a million people each year through extreme heat and threatening hospitals worldwide, according to a major report released on Friday at COP30 in Belém, Brazil.",
      "content": "The special report on health and climate change, published by the UN World Health Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian Government, warns that one in 12 hospitals could face climate-related shutdowns. It calls for urgent action to protect health systems in a rapidly warming world.\n\nThis follows Thursday’s launch of the Belém Health Action Plan, a flagship COP30 initiative putting health at the centre of climate policy.\n\nWhat the WHO says\n\nTweet URL\n\n“The climate crisis is a health crisis – not in the distant future, but here and now,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\n“This special report provides evidence on the impact of climate change on individuals and health systems, and real-world examples of what countries can do – and are doing – to protect health and strengthen health systems.”\n\nWhy it matters\n\nGlobal temperatures are already above 1.5°C. The report finds that 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in areas highly vulnerable to climate impacts, while hospitals face a 41 per cent higher risk of damage from extreme weather compared to 1990.\n\nWithout rapid decarbonisation, the number of health facilities at risk could double by mid-century. The health sector itself contributes around 5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, underscoring the need for a swift transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient systems.\n\nKey gaps in health adaptation\n\nThe report highlights stark gaps in health adaptation planning:\n\nOnly 54 per cent of national health adaptation plans assess risks to health facilities.\n\nof national health adaptation plans assess risks to health facilities. Fewer than 30 per cent consider income disparities.\n\nconsider income disparities. Just 20 per cent take gender into account.\n\ntake gender into account. Less than 1 per cent include people with disabilities.\n\nProgress has been made – the number of countries with multi-hazard early warning systems doubled between 2015 and 2023 – but coverage remains uneven, especially in least developed countries and small island states.\n\nWhat’s being done\n\nAdding momentum, a coalition of more than 35 philanthropies today pledged $300 million to accelerate solutions at the intersection of climate and health.\n\nThe Climate and Health Funders Coalition – which includes Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Gates Foundation, IKEA Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, and Wellcome – will back innovations, policies and research on extreme heat, air pollution and climate-sensitive diseases, as well as strengthen health systems and data integration. Find out more here.\n\nThe coalition’s inaugural funding effort supports the Belém Health Action Plan and aims to deliver “no-regret” interventions that save lives now. With the past decade the hottest on record and temperatures set to remain near historic highs, experts warn that failure to act risks catastrophic consequences for human health.\n\n‘Adaptation is urgent’: COP30 health envoy calls for action\n\nUN News spoke with Ethel Maciel, COP30’s special envoy for health and one of the architects of the Belém Health Action Plan. She stressed that climate change is no longer a distant threat – it is reshaping health systems now.\n\n© UNFCCC/Kiara Worth\n\n“Then, how do we prepare our health units, our hospitals, our structures for these extreme events that will happen with increasing frequency? And how can we provide training and capacity-building for health professionals so that they can face these extreme events that will be caused by what we are already experiencing in these climate changes,” she said.\n\n“One example here in Brazil, was last year’s flooding in Rio Grande do Sul, [which triggered] the largest dengue epidemic in history, driven by these climate changes. So, it is not something for us to think about in the future; it’s happening now. So, thinking about how to adapt our system is urgent.”\n\nMs. Maciel outlined three pillars of the plan:\n\nMonitoring to integrate climate and health data, enabling forecasts of heat-related health demand and better reporting of climate-linked cases.\n\nto integrate climate and health data, enabling forecasts of heat-related health demand and better reporting of climate-linked cases. Resilient systems and training so health professionals can identify and treat impacts such as dehydration or cardiac stress.\n\nso health professionals can identify and treat impacts such as dehydration or cardiac stress. Research and innovation to develop heat-resistant medicines and vaccines, cut pollution in health supply chains, and expand renewable energy use.\n\nShe warned that implementation is critical in the Amazon, where deforestation could unleash unknown pathogens. “We have … pathogens that we do not yet even fully [understand],” she said, urging leaders to ensure the plan “does not become just another paper and another very beautiful declaration, but that does not happen in practice.”\n\nUN News is reporting from Belém, bringing you front-row coverage of everything unfolding at COP30.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Climate change is causing serious health problems worldwide, including extreme heat that kills many people and threatens hospitals. The UN World Health Organization (WHO) and Brazil released a report at COP30, a major climate meeting in Belém, Brazil, to highlight these dangers.\n\n**What happened** – The WHO report says one in 12 hospitals could close because of climate-related problems like floods or storms. It calls for urgent action to protect health systems. At COP30, a new plan called the Belém Health Action Plan was launched to focus on health in climate policies. Also, over 35 philanthropies, including big groups like the Gates Foundation and IKEA Foundation, pledged $300 million to support projects that tackle health risks from climate change.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because billions of people live in places very vulnerable to climate effects. Hospitals now face much higher risks than before, and without quick action, these risks will double. The health sector itself causes 5% of global greenhouse gases, so it needs to change too. The report shows many countries are not fully prepared to protect health facilities, especially for vulnerable groups like women and people with disabilities.\n\n**What’s next step** – The $300 million fund will support new ideas, research, and stronger health systems to handle heat, pollution, and diseases linked to climate change. The Belém Health Action Plan will help countries monitor health and climate data, train health workers, and develop better medicines and clean energy for hospitals. Experts warn that acting now is critical to prevent worse health crises as climate change continues.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The WHO report and new funding at COP30 show that protecting health from climate change is urgent and requires global cooperation and innovation.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Le changement climatique provoque déjà de graves problèmes de santé dans le monde, notamment des vagues de chaleur extrême qui tuent de nombreuses personnes et menacent les hôpitaux. L’Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) et le Brésil ont publié un rapport lors de la COP30 à Belém, au Brésil, pour souligner ces dangers.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Le rapport de l’OMS indique qu’un hôpital sur 12 pourrait fermer à cause de problèmes liés au climat, comme les inondations ou les tempêtes. Il appelle à une action urgente pour protéger les systèmes de santé. À la COP30, un nouveau plan appelé Plan d’action santé de Belém a été lancé pour mettre la santé au cœur des politiques climatiques. De plus, plus de 35 philanthropies, dont de grands groupes comme la Fondation Gates et la Fondation IKEA, ont promis 300 millions de dollars pour soutenir des projets qui combattent les risques sanitaires liés au changement climatique.\n\n**Impact** – Cela est important car des milliards de personnes vivent dans des endroits très vulnérables aux effets du climat. Les hôpitaux sont désormais beaucoup plus exposés qu’avant, et sans action rapide, ces risques pourraient doubler. Le secteur de la santé lui-même produit 5 % des gaz à effet de serre mondiaux, il doit donc aussi changer. Le rapport montre que de nombreux pays ne sont pas encore prêts à protéger les établissements de santé, surtout pour les groupes vulnérables comme les femmes et les personnes handicapées.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – Le fonds de 300 millions de dollars soutiendra de nouvelles idées, recherches et systèmes de santé renforcés pour gérer la chaleur, la pollution et les maladies liées au climat. Le Plan d’action santé de Belém aidera les pays à surveiller les données santé et climat, former les professionnels de santé, et développer de meilleurs médicaments et des énergies propres pour les hôpitaux. Les experts avertissent qu’il faut agir maintenant pour éviter des crises sanitaires plus graves.\n\n**En une phrase** – Le rapport de l’OMS et le nouveau financement annoncés à la COP30 montrent que protéger la santé face au changement climatique est urgent et nécessite une coopération mondiale et de l’innovation.\n",
