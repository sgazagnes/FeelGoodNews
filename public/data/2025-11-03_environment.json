      "summary": "Cambridge researchers have engineered a solar-powered “artificial leaf” that mimics photosynthesis to make valuable chemicals sustainably. Their biohybrid device combines organic semiconductors and enzymes to convert CO₂ and sunlight into formate with high efficiency. It’s durable, non-toxic, and runs without fossil fuels—paving the way for a greener chemical industry.",
      "content": "“If we’re going to build a circular, sustainable economy, the chemical industry is a big, complex problem that we must address,” said Professor Erwin Reisner from Cambridge’s Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who led the research. “We’ve got to come up with ways to de-fossilize this important sector, which produces so many important products we all need. It’s a huge opportunity if we can get it right.”\n\nes about 6% of the world’s total carbon emissions.\n\nNow, a team led by the University of Cambridge is exploring innovative approaches that could eventually “de-fossilize” this vital industry.\n\nTheir breakthrough involves a hybrid device that brings together light-absorbing organic polymers and bacterial enzymes to transform sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into formate, a clean fuel that can power additional chemical reactions.\n\nThis “semi-artificial leaf” replicates photosynthesis, the natural process plants use to turn sunlight into energy, and operates entirely on its own power. Unlike previous designs that relied on toxic or unstable light absorbers, this new biohybrid model uses non-toxic materials, runs more efficiently, and remains stable without extra additives.\n\nIn laboratory tests, the team successfully used sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into formate and then applied it directly in a “domino” reaction to synthesize a valuable compound used in pharmaceuticals, achieving both high yield and purity.\n\nAccording to findings published in Joule, this marks the first instance where organic semiconductors have served as the light-capturing component in such a biohybrid system, paving the way for a new generation of eco-friendly artificial leaves.\n\nThe chemical industry remains a cornerstone of the global economy, producing a vast range of goods—from medicines and fertilizers to plastics, paints, electronics, cleaning agents, and toiletries.\n\n“If we’re going to build a circular, sustainable economy, the chemical industry is a big, complex problem that we must address,” said Professor Erwin Reisner from Cambridge’s Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who led the research. “We’ve got to come up with ways to de-fossilize this important sector, which produces so many important products we all need. It’s a huge opportunity if we can get it right.”\n\nReisner’s research group specializes in the development of artificial leaves, which turn sunlight into carbon-based fuels and chemicals without relying on fossil fuels. But many of their earlier designs depend on synthetic catalysts or inorganic semiconductors, which either degrade quickly, waste much of the solar spectrum, or contain toxic elements such as lead.\n\n“If we can remove the toxic components and start using organic elements, we end up with a clean chemical reaction and a single end product, without any unwanted side reactions,” said co-first author Dr. Celine Yeung, who completed the research as part of her PhD work in Reisner’s lab. “This device combines the best of both worlds – organic semiconductors are tuneable and non-toxic, while biocatalysts are highly selective and efficient.”\n\nThe new device integrates organic semiconductors with enzymes from sulfate-reducing bacteria, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen or converting carbon dioxide into formate.\n\nThe researchers have also addressed a long-standing challenge: most systems require chemical additives, known as buffers, to keep the enzymes running. These can break down quickly and limit stability. By embedding a helper enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, into a porous titania structure, the researchers enabled the system to work in a simple bicarbonate solution — similar to sparkling water — without unsustainable additives.\n\n“It’s like a big puzzle,” said co-first author Dr. Yongpeng Liu, a postdoctoral researcher in Reisner’s lab. “We have all these different components that we’ve been trying to bring together for a single purpose. It took us a long time to figure out how this specific enzyme is immobilized on an electrode, but we’re now starting to see the fruits from these efforts.”\n\n“By really studying how the enzyme works, we were able to precisely design the materials that make up the different layers of our sandwich-like device,” said Yeung. “This design made the parts work together more effectively, from the tiny nanoscale up to the full artificial leaf.”\n\nTests showed the artificial leaf produced high currents and achieved near-perfect efficiency in directing electrons into fuel-making reactions. The device successfully ran for over 24 hours: more than twice as long as previous designs.\n\nThe researchers are hoping to further develop their designs to extend the lifespan of the device and adapt it so it can produce different types of chemical products.\n\n“We’ve shown it’s possible to create solar-powered devices that are not only efficient and durable but also free from toxic or unsustainable components,” said Reisner. “This could be a fundamental platform for producing green fuels and chemicals in future – it’s a real opportunity to do some exciting and important chemistry.”\n\nThe research was supported in part by the Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the European Research Council, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Royal Academy of Engineering, and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).

      "title": "Scientists discover 14 strange new species hidden in the deep sea",
      "summary": "Scientists are revolutionizing how new marine species are described through the Ocean Species Discoveries initiative. Using advanced lab techniques, researchers recently unveiled 14 new species from ocean depths exceeding 6,000 meters. Their findings include a record-setting mollusk, a carnivorous bivalve, and a popcorn-like parasitic isopod. The project aims to make taxonomy faster, more accessible, and globally collaborative.",
      "content": "Earth's oceans hold extraordinary biodiversity, yet only a small portion of an estimated two million marine species have been formally identified and described. One of the biggest hurdles in ocean science is the lengthy delay -- sometimes lasting decades -- between when a species is first discovered and when it is officially documented.\n\nTo overcome this bottleneck, researchers launched Ocean Species Discoveries, a data-rich publication platform designed for concise, high-quality marine invertebrate species descriptions. By providing a faster, more standardized system, it dramatically shortens the time needed to publish new species. This speed is essential, as many marine species face extinction due to human-driven biodiversity loss before scientists even learn they exist.\n\nThe project is coordinated by the Senckenberg Ocean Species Alliance (SOSA), part of the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt. SOSA's mission is to foster global cooperation, supply technical resources for species documentation, and promote efficient, transparent taxonomic publishing.\n\n14 New Species Described in the Latest Research Collection\n\nIn the second major Ocean Species Discoveries collection, more than 20 researchers collaborated to describe 14 new marine invertebrate species and two new genera from across the globe. These included a variety of worms, mollusks, and crustaceans. The findings were published in Biodiversity Data Journal, marking a milestone one year after the project's pilot paper.\n\n\"Our shared vision is making taxonomy faster, more efficient, more accessible and more visible,\" the team said in their paper.\n\nMany of the new discoveries were made possible through the Discovery Laboratory at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt. The lab provides access to cutting-edge techniques such as light and electron microscopy, confocal imaging, molecular barcoding, and micro-CT scanning. These tools enable researchers to collect detailed, high-quality data for precise species descriptions.\n\nThe study's subjects were collected from ocean depths ranging from just 1 meter to more than 6,000 meters. Among them is Veleropilina gretchenae, a newly identified mollusk recovered from the Aleutian Trench at 6,465 meters. It is one of the first members of the class Monoplacophora to have a high-quality genome published directly from its holotype specimen.\n\nRecord-Breaking Discovery: The Carnivorous Bivalve Myonera aleutiana\n\nA major highlight of the project is the detailed anatomical study of Myonera aleutiana, a carnivorous bivalve. This marks only the second bivalve species ever documented entirely through non-invasive micro-CT scanning. The process produced more than 2,000 tomographic images, revealing remarkable detail of the animal's soft tissue and internal structure. It is also the first in-depth anatomical description for any Myonera species and sets a new depth record -- found between 5,170 and 5,280 meters, about 800 meters deeper than any previously known specimen.\n\nHonoring a Scientific Legacy\n\nOne of the newly described species, Apotectonia senckenbergae, was named in honor of Johanna Rebecca Senckenberg (1716-1743), a naturalist and benefactor whose support for science and medicine helped inspire the formation of the Senckenberg Society for Nature Research. The amphipod was discovered at a depth of 2,602 meters in a mussel bed within the Galápagos Rift hydrothermal vent fields.\n\nOcean Oddities: Popcorn Parasites and Deep-Sea Hitchhikers\n\nSome of the newly identified animals display peculiar traits. The parasitic isopod Zeaione everta has raised structures on the female's back that resemble popped corn kernels. Its genus name, derived from Zea (the corn genus), highlights this unusual appearance. Found in the Australian intertidal zone, the isopod also represents a completely new genus.\n\nResearchers also observed fascinating interactions among known deep-sea creatures. The tusk shell Laevidentalium wiesei, collected from depths exceeding 5,000 meters, was discovered with a sea anemone attached to its anterior (concave) side -- a relationship never before documented within this genus.\n\nMapping Life in the Deepest Oceans\n\nThese discoveries showcase how global collaboration and advanced imaging are transforming marine taxonomy. By accelerating how species are documented and named, scientists can better understand -- and potentially protect -- the countless forms of life still hidden in Earth's vast and mysterious oceans.",

      "title": "Teachers unions leverage contracts to fight climate change",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "This story first appeared on The Hechinger Report , a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.\n\nIn Illinois, the Chicago Teachers Union won a contract with the city’s schools to add solar panels on some buildings and clean energy career pathways for students, among other actions. In Minnesota, the Minneapolis Federation of Educators demanded that the district create a task force on environmental issues and provide free metro passes for students. And in California, the Los Angeles teachers union’s demands include electrifying the district’s bus fleet and providing electric vehicle charging stations at all schools.\n\nThose are among the examples in a new report on how unionized teachers are pushing their school districts to take action on the climate crisis, which is damaging school buildings and disrupting learning. The report — produced by the nonprofit Building Power Resource Center, which supports local governments and leaders, and the Labor Network for Sustainability, a nonprofit that seeks to unite labor and climate groups — describes how educators can raise demands for climate action when they negotiate labor contracts with their districts. By emphasizing the financial case for switching to renewable energy, educators can simultaneously act on climate change, improve conditions in schools and save districts money, it says.\n\nAs federal support and financial incentives for climate action wither, this sort of local action is becoming more difficult — but also more urgent, advocates say. Chicago Public Schools has relied on funding for electric buses that has been sunsetted by the Trump administration, said Jackson Potter, vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union. But the district is also seeking other local and state funding and nonprofit support.\n\nBradley Marianno, an associate professor in the College of Education at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said that educator unions embracing climate action is part of a move started about 15 years ago in which more progressive unions — like those in Chicago, Los Angeles and elsewhere — focus on “collective good bargaining,” or advocating for changes that are good for their members but also the broader community. But this approach is unlikely to catch on everywhere: “The risk lies in members feeling that core issues like wages and working conditions are being overlooked in favor of more global causes,” he wrote in an email.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nI recently caught up with Potter, the CTU vice president, about the report and his union’s approach to bargaining for climate action. Collaborating with local environmental and community groups, the Chicago Teachers Union ultimately succeeded in winning a contract that calls for identifying schools for solar panels and electrification, expanding indoor air quality monitoring, helping educators integrate climate change into their curriculum, and establishing training for students in clean energy jobs, among other steps.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ. The report talks about contract negotiations being an underused — and effective — lever for demanding climate action. Why do you see that process as such an opportunity for climate action?\n\nOn the local level, our schools are 84, 83 years old on average. There is lead paint, lead pipes, mold, asbestos, PCBs, all kinds of contamination in the HVAC system and the walls that require upgrades. By our estimate, the district needs $30 billion worth of upgrades, and right now I think they spend $500 million a year to just do patch-up work. We’re at a point where it’s a system fail of epic proportions if we can’t figure out a way to transition and make things healthier. And so if you’re going to do a roof repair, put solar on it, have independence from fossil fuels, clean air in areas that have faced environmental racism and contamination.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nWe’re also dealing with a legacy of discrimination and harm, and that is true of the nation. So how do we get out of this and also save the planet and also prevent greater climate events that further destabilize vulnerable communities and put people at risk? It made sense for us to use our contract as a path to do both things — deal with this local crisis that was screaming for new solutions and ideas, in a moment when the climate is on fire, literally.\n\nQ. How challenging was it to get educators to view climate issues as a priority? There are so many other things, around pay and other issues, on the table.\n\nWhen we started, it almost felt like people in the membership, in the community, viewed it as a niche issue. Like, ‘Oh, isn’t that cute, you care about green technology.’ As we figured out how to think about it and talk about it and probe where people were having issues in their schools, it became really obvious that when you started talking about asbestos, lead and mold remediation — and helping communities that have been hit the hardest with cumulative impacts and carcinogens and how those things are present in schools — that became much more tangible. Or even quality food and lunch and breakfast for students who are low-income. It went from bottom of the list to top of the list, instantaneously.\n\nQ. Your contract calls for a number of climate-related actions, including green pathways for students and agreements with building trade unions to create good jobs for students. Tell me about that.\n\nWe’re trying to use the transformation of our facilities as another opportunity for families and students in these communities that have been harmed the most to get the greatest benefit from the transformation. So if we can install solar, we want our students to be part of that project on the ground in their schools, gaining the skills and apprenticeship credentials to become the electricians of the future. And using that as a project labor agreement [which establishes the terms of work on a certain project] with the trades to open doors and opportunities. The same goes for all the other improvements — whether it’s heat pumps, HVAC systems, geothermal. And for EV — we have outdated auto shop programming that’s exclusively based on the combustible engine reliant on fossil fuels, whereas in [the nearby city of] Belvidere they are building electric cars per the United Auto Workers’ new contract. Could we gain a career path on electric vehicles that allows students to gain that mechanical knowledge and insight and prepares them for the vehicles of the future?\n\nQ. The report talks about the Batesville School District in Arkansas that was able to increase teacher salaries because of savings from solar. Have you tried to make the case for higher teacher salaries because of these climate steps?\n\nThe $500 million our district allocates for facility upgrades annually comes out of the general fund, so we haven’t at all thought about it in terms of salary. We’ve thought about it in terms of having a school nurse, social worker, mental health interventions at a moment when there is so much trauma. We see this as a win-win: The fewer dollars the district has to spend on facility needs means the more dollars they can spend on instructional and social-emotional needs for students. In terms of the Arkansas model, it’s pretty basic. If you get off the fossil fuel pipelines and electric lines and you become self-sufficient, essentially, powering your own electric and heat, there is going to be a boon, particularly if there are up-front subsidies.\n\nMath and climate change\n\nWhen temperatures rise in classrooms, students have more trouble concentrating and their learning suffers — in math, in particular. That’s according to a new report from NWEA, an education research and testing company.\n\nThe report, part of a growing body of evidence of the harms of extreme heat on student performance, found that math scores declined when outdoor temperatures on test days rose above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Students in high-poverty schools, which are less likely to have air conditioning, saw declines up to twice as large as those in wealthier schools.\n\nThe learning losses grew as temperatures rose. Students who took tests on 101-degree days scored roughly 0.06 standard deviations below students who tested when temperatures were 60 degrees, the equivalent of about 10 percent of the learning a fifth grader typically gains in a school year.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear why student math scores suffer more than reading when temperatures rise. But Sofia Postell, an NWEA research analyst, said that on math tests, students must problem-solve and rely on their memories, and that kind of thinking is particularly difficult when students are hot and tired. Anxiety could be a factor too, she wrote in an email: “Research has also shown that heat increases anxiety, and some students may experience more testing anxiety around math exams.”\n\nThe study was based on data from roughly 3 million scores on NWEA’s signature MAP Growth test for third to eighth graders in six states.\n\nThe report urged school, district and state officials to take several steps to reduce the effects of high heat on student learning and testing. Ideally, tests would be scheduled during times of the year when it wasn’t so hot, it said, and also during mornings, when temperatures are cooler. Leaders also need to invest in updating HVAC systems to keep kids cool.\n\n“Extreme heat has already detrimentally impacted student learning and these effects will only intensify without action,” wrote Postell.",

      "title": "Scientists uncover what delayed Earth’s oxygen boom for a billion years",
      "summary": "Researchers uncovered that trace compounds like nickel and urea may have delayed Earth’s oxygenation for millions of years. Experiments mimicking early Earth revealed how their concentrations controlled cyanobacterial growth, dictating when oxygen began to accumulate. As nickel declined and urea stabilized, photosynthetic life thrived, sparking the Great Oxidation Event. The findings could also guide the search for biosignatures on distant worlds.",
      "content": "The arrival of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere marked a defining moment in the planet's history, transforming it into a world capable of supporting complex life. This major shift, known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), took place approximately 2.1 to 2.4 billion years ago. However, oxygenic photosynthesis -- produced by cyanobacteria -- had likely evolved hundreds of millions of years before this event. Despite this early ability to generate oxygen, atmospheric levels remained low for a surprisingly long time. Scientists have long debated the cause of this delay, considering explanations such as volcanic emissions, chemical sinks, and biological interactions. Yet no single factor has fully explained why it took so long for oxygen to build up in Earth's air.\n\nTo tackle this enduring question, researchers focused on an often overlooked element of early Earth chemistry: the role of trace compounds such as nickel and urea in cyanobacterial growth.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Dilan M. Ratnayake from the Institute for Planetary Materials, Okayama University, Japan (current address is Department of Geology, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka), explained, \"Generating oxygen would be a massive challenge if we are ever to colonizeanother planet. Therefore, we sought to understand how a tiny microbe, cyanobacteria, was capable of altering the Earth's conditions to make them suitable for the evolution of complex life, including our own. The insights gained from this study will also provide a new framework for the sample analysis strategies for future Mars sample return missions.\"\n\nProfessors Ryoji Tanaka and Eizo Nakamura from the same institute also collaborated on the work, which was published in the journal in Communications Earth & Environment.\n\nRecreating Early Earth in the Lab\n\nThe team conducted a two-part experimental study designed to mimic conditions on the Archean Earth (roughly 4 to 2.5 billion years ago). In the first experiment, mixtures of ammonium, cyanide, and iron compounds were exposed to ultraviolet (UV)-C light, replicating the intense radiation that likely reached Earth's surface before the ozone layer formed. These tests explored whether urea -- an important nitrogen compound for life -- could have formed naturally under such conditions.\n\nIn the second phase, cultures of cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002) were grown under alternating light and dark periods while varying the amounts of nickel and urea in their environment. The researchers monitored growth through optical density and chlorophyll-a levels to measure how these chemical factors affected cyanobacterial productivity.\n\nBased on the results, the team proposed a new model explaining how oxygen gradually accumulated in the atmosphere. During the early Archean, abundant nickel and urea may have restricted cyanobacterial blooms, preventing sustained oxygen release. As Dr. Ratnayake noted, \"Nickel has a complex yet fascinating relationship with urea regarding its formation as well as its biological consumption, while the availability of these at lower concentrations can lead to the proliferation of cyanobacteria.\" When these levels eventually declined, cyanobacteria were able to thrive more persistently, driving the oxygen increase that culminated in the GOE.\n\nLessons for Earth and Beyond\n\nThe implications of these findings extend far beyond understanding ancient history. \"If we can clearly understand the mechanisms for increasing the atmospheric oxygen content, it will shed light upon the biosignature detection in other planets,\" said Dr. Ratnayake. He continued, \"The findings demonstrate that the interplay among inorganic and organic compounds played crucial roles in Earth's environmental changes, deepening our understanding of the evolution of Earth's oxygen and hence the life on it.\"\n\nThese insights could also inform future planetary exploration, since elements such as nickel and urea may affect the development of oxygen and life on other worlds.\n\nBy demonstrating how urea could form naturally under Archean conditions and showing that it acts as both a nutrient and an inhibitor, the researchers revealed how subtle chemical balances shaped Earth's early biosphere. Their findings suggest that as nickel levels decreased and urea stabilized, cyanobacteria flourished, releasing oxygen in large quantities. This gradual shift ultimately transformed Earth from a lifeless planet into one capable of sustaining complex ecosystems -- a profound step in the planet's long journey toward habitability.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Around 2.1 to 2.4 billion years ago, Earth’s atmosphere gained much more oxygen in an event called the Great Oxidation Event. However, the tiny microbes that produce oxygen, called cyanobacteria, existed hundreds of millions of years before that. Scientists have wondered why oxygen didn’t build up in the air earlier.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers recreated early Earth conditions in the lab to study how small chemicals like nickel and urea affected cyanobacteria growth. They found that when nickel was high and urea levels changed, cyanobacteria grew less, slowing oxygen production. Later, as nickel dropped and urea stabilized, cyanobacteria thrived and released more oxygen. This helped trigger the big rise in Earth's oxygen.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery explains a long-standing mystery about why Earth’s oxygen increase took so long. It also shows how tiny chemical changes controlled the planet’s ability to support complex life. Understanding this helps scientists know what to look for when searching for signs of life on other planets.\n\n**What’s next step** – Scientists can use these findings to guide missions that study other worlds, like Mars. By knowing which chemicals influence oxygen and life, future space explorers can better identify planets that might support living things.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists found that changes in nickel and urea levels controlled cyanobacteria growth, explaining why Earth’s oxygen rise was delayed for over a billion years and helping guide the search for life beyond Earth.",
