      "title": "A “dormant” brain protein turns out to be a powerful switch",
      "summary": "Scientists at Johns Hopkins have uncovered a surprising new way to influence brain activity by targeting a long-mysterious class of proteins linked to anxiety, schizophrenia, and movement disorders. Once thought to be mostly inactive, these proteins—called GluDs—turn out to play an active role in how brain cells communicate and form connections.",
      "content": "Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine report that they have uncovered a promising drug target that could allow scientists to increase or decrease the activity of specific brain proteins. The discovery may lead to new treatments for psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and schizophrenia, as well as a neurological disorder that affects movement and balance. The work was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe proteins at the center of the research are known as delta-type ionotropic glutamate receptors, or GluDs. These proteins are known to play an important role in how neurons communicate with each other. According to the researchers, mutations in GluDs have been linked to psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and schizophrenia. Despite this connection, scientists have struggled for years to understand exactly how these proteins work, making it difficult to design treatments that could regulate their activity.\n\n\"This class of protein has long been thought to be sitting dormant in the brain,\" says Edward Twomey, Ph.D., assistant professor of biophysics and biophysical chemistry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"Our findings indicate they are very much active and offer a potential channel to develop new therapies.\"\n\nThe study describing these findings was published in Nature.\n\nImaging Reveals How GluDs Function\n\nTo better understand GluDs, Twomey and his team used cryo-electron microscopy, an advanced imaging technique that allows scientists to visualize proteins in fine detail. Their analysis showed that GluDs contain an ion channel at their center. This channel holds charged particles that help the proteins interact with neurotransmitters (electrical signals that allow brain cells to communicate with one another).\n\n\"This process is fundamental for the formation of synapses, the connection point where cells communicate,\" says Twomey.\n\nImplications for Movement Disorders and Mental Illness\n\nThe discovery could help accelerate the development of drugs for cerebellar ataxia, a disorder that affects movement and balance. Cerebellar ataxia can result from stroke, head injury, brain tumors, or certain neurodegenerative diseases, and it may also cause memory problems. In this condition, GluDs become \"super-active\" even when there is no electrical signaling in the brain. Twomey explains that a potential treatment approach would involve developing drugs that block this excessive activity.\n\nIn schizophrenia, the situation appears to be reversed. GluDs are less active than normal, and Twomey says future drugs could aim to boost their activity instead.\n\nPotential Links to Aging and Memory Loss\n\nThe findings may also be relevant to aging and memory decline. Because GluDs help regulate synapses, drugs that target these proteins could help maintain synapse function over time. Synapses are essential for learning, memory, and the formation of thoughts.\n\n\"Because GluDs directly regulate synapses, we could potentially develop a targeted drug for any condition where synapses malfunction,\" Twomey says.\n\nNext Steps and Ongoing Research\n\nLooking ahead, Twomey says he plans to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies to further develop this therapeutic target. His team is also studying specific GluD mutations that have been directly linked to schizophrenia, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders. The goal is to better understand how these conditions progress and to design more precise treatments.\n\nOther Johns Hopkins scientists who contributed to the study include Haobo Wang, Fairine Ahmed, Jeffrey Khau, and Anish Kumar Mondal.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University has filed a patent covering the techniques used to measure electrical currents from GluDs.\n\nFunding for the research came from the National Institutes of Health (R35GM154904), the Searle Scholars Program, and the Diana Helis Henry Medical Research Foundation.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long studied a group of brain proteins called GluDs, which are connected to disorders like anxiety, schizophrenia, and problems with movement. Until now, these proteins were thought to be mostly inactive or “dormant.”\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Johns Hopkins used a special imaging method called cryo-electron microscopy to look closely at GluDs. They found that these proteins have an ion channel that helps brain cells communicate by passing charged particles. This shows GluDs are active and important for forming synapses—the connections between brain cells.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it reveals a new way to control brain activity. For example, in a movement disorder called cerebellar ataxia, GluDs become too active, and drugs could be made to block this. In schizophrenia, these proteins are less active, so treatments might boost their function. Since synapses are key for learning and memory, this could also help with memory loss as people age.\n\n**What’s next step** – The Johns Hopkins team plans to work with drug companies to create medicines that target GluDs. They are also studying specific changes in these proteins linked to mental illnesses to design better treatments.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have found that GluD proteins actively control brain connections, opening new paths to treat mental health and movement disorders.\n",

      "title": "Major review finds no autism or ADHD risk from pregnancy Tylenol",
      "summary": "A major new scientific review brings reassuring news for expectant parents: using acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy does not increase a child’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability. Researchers analyzed 43 high-quality studies, including powerful sibling comparisons that help separate medication effects from genetics and family environment. Earlier warnings appear to have been driven by underlying maternal health factors such as fever or pain rather than the medication itself.",
      "content": "Taking acetaminophen, commonly known by the brand name Tylenol, during pregnancy does not raise the risk of autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or intellectual disability in children. This conclusion comes from the most comprehensive review of the evidence so far, published on January 16 in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Women's Health. The study was led by researchers at City St George's, University of London.\n\nThe research team carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis drawing on results from 43 previously published studies. Their goal was to determine whether acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe. The analysis was prompted by renewed public concern following claims made in September 2025 suggesting that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen could interfere with brain development and increase the likelihood of autism.\n\nThose concerns were fueled by earlier studies that found small statistical links between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism diagnoses. However, many of those studies had important limitations. Some relied on incomplete data, while others failed to account for family history or genetic factors. One major gap was the lack of comparisons between siblings, which can help separate the effects of medication from inherited traits and shared environments.\n\nWhy Sibling Comparisons Matter\n\nTo address these weaknesses, the researchers focused on the highest-quality evidence available. They compared pregnancies in which acetaminophen was used with those in which it was not, paying particular attention to studies that examined siblings born to the same mother. In these sibling comparison studies, one child was exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy while another was not.\n\nThis approach allows researchers to better control for shared genetics, household environment, and long-term parental characteristics. These factors are difficult to fully account for in traditional observational studies but can strongly influence child development.\n\nThe sibling comparison data were extensive. Researchers analyzed outcomes for 262,852 children assessed for autism, 335,255 evaluated for ADHD, and 406,681 assessed for intellectual disability. Across these large groups, there was no evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy increased the risk of any of these conditions when compared with pregnancies where the medication was not used.\n\nResearchers Explain the Findings\n\nProfessor Asma Khalil, Professor of Obstetrics and Maternal Fetal Medicine at City St George's, University of London and Consultant Obstetrician, led the study and addressed why earlier research may have raised alarms.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that previously reported links are likely to be explained by genetic predisposition or other maternal factors such as fever or underlying pain, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself.\n\n\"The message is clear -- paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided. This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever, and so they should feel reassured that they still have a safe option to relieve them of their symptoms.\"\n\nStrong Quality Controls and Remaining Limits\n\nEach study included in the analysis was evaluated using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool, which assesses multiple aspects of study design to estimate the risk of bias. The lack of any link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability remained consistent even when the researchers limited their analysis to studies rated as low risk of bias (and therefore highest quality). The same reassuring results were seen in studies that followed children for more than five years.\n\nThe authors also noted some limitations. There was not enough consistent data to examine whether risks differed by trimester of exposure, the sex of the baby, or how frequently acetaminophen was used. Too few of the existing sibling comparison studies reported those details.\n\nWhat This Means for Pregnant Patients\n\nOverall, the findings align with guidance from major medical organizations around the world. The researchers hope this thorough review will help ease lingering doubts about using acetaminophen during pregnancy. Avoiding treatment for significant pain or fever can carry known risks for both the mother and the baby, especially when maternal fever goes untreated. This evidence supports the continued use of acetaminophen as a safe option when taken as directed.",

      "content": "A \"living glue\" used by barnacles to attach to underwater surfaces could also seal gut wounds caused by inflammatory bowel disease\n\nInflammatory bowel disease can cause wounds that bleed SPRINGER MEDIZIN/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n\nScientists looking to provide relief for people with inflammatory bowel disease have turned to an unusual source for inspiration: barnacles.\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, seems to occur when someone’s immune system attacks their bowel, leaving it inflamed. Its main symptoms are diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain, weight loss and bleeding from the gut into faeces.\n\nAnti-inflammatory drugs, such as steroids, can ease symptoms. But if bleeding persists, doctors may use small metal clips, passed into the gut via the anus, to close wounds caused by the inflammation. However, this carries the risk of infections and can even worsen the wounds.\n\nSearching for a gentler approach, scientists previously genetically engineered bacteria to produce substances that help heal wounds. However, such microbes are typically cleared from the gut within a couple of days, and must be manually activated using drugs, says Bolin An at the Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology in China.\n\nNow, An and his colleagues have genetically engineered a harmless strain of Escherichia coli bacteria to produce a protein fragment that promotes wound healing upon sensing blood. Crucially, the bacteria also make certain types of “cement proteins”, which barnacles use to attach to underwater surfaces. Based on tests in lab dishes, the team hoped these proteins would act like an anti-inflammatory seal against bleeding wounds, calling it a “living glue”.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nTo put it to the test, the researchers used a toxic chemical to induce IBD-like issues – including inflammation and gut wounds, which led to weight loss – in mice. Each mouse then received either a single dose of a harmless strain of non-engineered E.coli, the genetically engineered E.coli or a saline solution, all of which were delivered to the gut via a tube through the anus.\n\nTen days later, the mice that received the engineered bacteria, which were still present in their guts, regained most of the weight they had lost. Unlike the other two groups, their guts even resembled those of healthy mice. None of the mice showed signs of experiencing side effects.\n\nThe team also saw similar effects when the mice were given a pill containing the bacteria, suggesting that this approach could one day be administered orally in people. “It’s definitely promising and it’s a novel approach,” says Shaji Sebastian at Hull University in the UK. Gut wound healing and inflammation in mice is fairly similar to that in humans, although tests in people are needed, he says.\n\nThe researchers now plan to test the approach in larger animals, including pigs, partly to determine how long the engineered bacteria can be retained within the gut, says An. But it could be up to 10 years before it reaches clinics, because so much testing is needed to show that it not only works, but also provides benefits over existing treatments in people, says Sebastian.",

      "summary": "Researchers found that autistic and non-autistic people move their faces differently when expressing emotions like anger, happiness, and sadness. Autistic participants tended to rely on different facial features and produced more varied expressions, which can look unfamiliar to non-autistic observers. The study suggests emotional misunderstandings are a two-way street, not a one-sided deficit.",
      "content": "A new study suggests that autistic and non-autistic people use their faces to show emotions in different ways. These differences may help explain why emotional expressions are sometimes misunderstood between the two groups.\n\nResearchers at the University of Birmingham carried out a large-scale project to map facial expressions linked to basic emotions such as anger, happiness and sadness. Using advanced facial motion tracking, the team recorded more than 265 million data points, creating one of the most detailed libraries of emotional facial movements to date.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Autism Research.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted\n\nThe study included 25 autistic adults and 26 non-autistic adults. Together, participants produced nearly 5000 facial expressions. Each person was asked to display anger, happiness and sadness in two settings: while matching facial movements to sounds and while speaking.\n\nClear differences emerged between the two groups. Autistic participants also showed a wider range of unique expressions. Specific patterns stood out:\n\nFor anger, autistic participants relied more heavily on mouth movements and used their eyebrows less than non-autistic participants;\n\nFor happiness, autistic participants displayed a more subtle smile that did not \"reach the eyes\"; and\n\nFor sadness, autistic participants created a downturned expression by lifting the upper lip more than their non-autistic peers.\n\nThe Role of Alexithymia in Emotional Expression\n\nThe researchers also examined the influence of alexithymia -- a 'sub-clinical' condition commonly found in autism that involves difficulty identifying and describing one's own emotions. People with higher levels of alexithymia showed less clearly defined facial expressions for anger and happiness, which made those emotions appear more ambiguous.\n\nWhy Emotional Misunderstandings Happen\n\nDr. Connor Keating, who led the research at the University of Birmingham and is now based in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford, explained that the differences go beyond how expressions look. \"Our findings suggest autistic and non-autistic people differ not only in the appearance of facial expressions, but also in how smoothly these expressions are formed. These mismatches in facial expressions may help to explain why autistic people struggle to recognize non-autistic expressions and vice versa.\"\n\nEmotional Expression as a Two-Way Challenge\n\nProfessor Jennifer Cook, the study's senior author at the University of Birmingham, emphasized that these differences should not be viewed as a deficit. \"Autistic and non-autistic people may express emotions in ways that are different but equally meaningful -- almost like speaking different languages. What has sometimes been interpreted as difficulties for autistic people might instead reflect a two-way challenge in understanding each other's expressions. We are currently investigating this idea, so watch this space for updates.\"\n\nFunding and Support\n\nThe research was supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC, United Kingdom) and the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long studied how people show emotions on their faces, but it has been unclear why autistic and non-autistic people sometimes misunderstand each other's expressions.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of Birmingham studied 25 autistic and 26 non-autistic adults, recording nearly 5,000 facial expressions of anger, happiness, and sadness. Using advanced tracking technology, they found that autistic people use different facial movements, like focusing more on mouth movements when angry or showing subtler smiles when happy.\n\n**Impact** – This study shows that emotional expressions are not just a problem for autistic people to fix. Instead, both groups express emotions differently, which can cause misunderstandings. The research highlights that these differences are equally meaningful, like speaking different languages with faces.\n\n**What's next step** – The team plans to continue studying how these differences affect communication, aiming to improve understanding between autistic and non-autistic people.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Autistic and non-autistic people show emotions differently on their faces, and recognizing this can help both groups understand each other better.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les scientifiques ont longtemps étudié comment les gens montrent leurs émotions sur leur visage, mais il était difficile de comprendre pourquoi les personnes autistes et non autistes peuvent mal interpréter les expressions de l'autre.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs de l’Université de Birmingham ont étudié 25 adultes autistes et 26 adultes non autistes, enregistrant près de 5 000 expressions faciales de colère, joie et tristesse. Grâce à une technologie avancée, ils ont découvert que les personnes autistes utilisent des mouvements du visage différents, comme plus de mouvements de la bouche lorsqu’elles sont en colère ou des sourires plus subtils lorsqu’elles sont heureuses.\n\n**Impact** – Cette étude montre que les expressions émotionnelles ne sont pas seulement un problème à résoudre pour les personnes autistes. Les deux groupes expriment leurs émotions de façon différente, ce qui peut provoquer des malentendus. Ces différences sont tout aussi importantes, comme parler des langues différentes avec le visage.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L’équipe prévoit de poursuivre ses recherches pour mieux comprendre comment ces différences influencent la communication, afin d’améliorer la compréhension entre personnes autistes et non autistes.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Les personnes autistes et non autistes montrent leurs émotions différemment sur le visage, et reconnaître cela peut aider chacun à mieux se comprendre.",
