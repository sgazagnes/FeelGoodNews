      "content": "Key Points:\n\nIn southern Peru's Pisco Valley, Monte Sierpe -- also known as the \"Band of Holes\" -- features thousands of perfectly aligned circular pits whose true purpose has long puzzled scientists.\n\nNew research combining microbotanical analysis and high-resolution drone imagery offers fresh insight into how and why this mysterious site was built.\n\nEvidence suggests Monte Sierpe may have first served as a bustling pre-Inca marketplace where traders, farmers, and travelers exchanged goods and ideas.\n\nLater, under Inca rule, it might have evolved into a sophisticated accounting and tribute system used to manage resources and record exchanges across the empire.\n\nClues Emerge in the Mystery of Peru's \"Band of Holes\"\n\nResearchers from the University of Sydney have found new evidence that could finally explain one of the Andes' most puzzling archaeological sites. Monte Sierpe (translated as \"serpent mountain\" and often called the \"Band of Holes\") lies in Peru's Pisco Valley and features more than 5,000 carefully aligned circular depressions carved into the desert hills.\n\nThis unusual formation has fascinated and mystified both scientists and the public for decades.\n\nLead author Dr. Jacob Bongers, a digital archaeologist at the University of Sydney, asked, \"Why would ancient peoples make over 5,000 holes in the foothills of southern Peru? Were they gardens? Did they capture water? Did they have an agricultural function? We don't know why they are here, but we have produced some promising new data that yield important clues and support novel theories about the site's use.\"\n\nUsing advanced drone technology, his team mapped the site and found numerical patterns in the layout that suggest deliberate design rather than random placement.\n\nThe researchers were astonished to discover that the layout of Monte Sierpe mirrors the structure of an Inca khipu (a knotted-string device used for recording information) found in the same valley.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary discovery that expands understandings about the origins and diversity of Indigenous accounting practices within and beyond the Andes,\" said Dr. Bongers.\n\nAncient Plants Reveal Trade and Transport Clues\n\nSoil samples from the holes revealed traces of maize (corn), one of the Andes' most essential crops, along with reeds that were traditionally used for weaving baskets. These findings show that ancient people placed plant materials into the holes, possibly using woven containers for transport.\n\n\"This is very intriguing,\" Dr. Bongers said. \"Perhaps this was a pre-Inca marketplace, like a flea market. We know the pre-Hispanic population here was around 100,000 people. Perhaps mobile traders (seafaring merchants and llama caravans), specialists (farmers and fisherfolk), and others were coming together at the site to exchange local goods such as corn and cotton. Fundamentally, I view these holes as a type of social technology that brought people together, and later became a large-scale accounting system under the Inca Empire.\n\n\"There are still many more questions -- why is this monument only seen here and not all over the Andes? Was Monte Sierpe a sort of 'landscape khipu'? -- but we are getting closer to understanding this mysterious site. It is very exciting.\"\n\nThe team's findings were published on November 10 in the journal Antiquity.\n\nStretching for about 1.5 kilometers across the Pisco Valley in southern Peru, Monte Sierpe consists of roughly 5,200 uniform holes, each 1-2 meters wide and 0.5-1 meter deep, arranged in rows and divided into distinct sections.\n\nThe site first gained widespread attention in 1933 when aerial photos appeared in National Geographic, but its true purpose has remained uncertain ever since.\n\n\"Hypotheses regarding Monte Sierpe's purpose range from defense, storage, and accounting to water collection, fog capture and gardening, yet the true function of the site remains unclear,\" said Dr. Bongers.\n\nDrones and Soil Analysis Offer New Clues\n\nTo better understand this enigmatic feature of Peru's landscape, Dr. Bongers and an international research team combined drone-based aerial photography with microbotanical analysis of sediments collected from the holes. These complementary approaches revealed new details about how the site was organized and used, both at a fine scale and across the broader landscape.\n\nTogether, the data support a new interpretation of Monte Sierpe as an Indigenous center for barter and exchange that may have evolved into an accounting system under Inca rule.\n\nMonte Sierpe's location adds weight to this idea. It sits between two Inca administrative centers and near a crossroads of pre-Hispanic roads. The area occupies a transitional ecological zone (chaupiyunga) between the Andes highlands and the lower coastal plain, an ideal meeting ground for trade between regions.\n\nThese findings suggest that the pre-Inca Chincha Kingdom may have built Monte Sierpe for organized barter and trading, and that the Inca later repurposed it for accounting and tribute collection.\n\n\"This research contributes an important Andean case study on how past communities modified landscapes to bring people together and promote interaction,\" said Dr. Bongers.\n\nInternational Collaboration and Technological Innovation\n\nDr. Jacob Bongers specializes in drone-based archaeological mapping and is the Tom Austen Brown Postdoctoral Research Associate in Archaeology at the University of Sydney. He is also a core member of the Vere Gordon Childe Centre (VGCC), which unites experts across disciplines to study humanity through time. In addition, he is a Visiting Research Fellow at the Australian Museum Research Institute.\n\nProfessor Kirsten McKenzie, Director of the VGCC, praised his work: \"We are all hugely proud of his achievement. Monte Sierpe is a high-profile site that attracts a lot of popular commentary online, including misinformation that threatens to overshadow Indigenous knowledge bases and community ownership over history and heritage.\n\n\"Dr. Bongers' team brought to light an incredible example of Indigenous accounting and exchange through interdisciplinary research and diverse expertise, highlighting how cutting-edge technologies and analyses lead to a completely novel understanding of Andean communities in the past.\"\n\nProfessor Charles Stanish, senior co-author from the University of South Florida, noted that despite its fame, Monte Sierpe had seen little professional archaeological study since its discovery in the 1930s and limited surveys in the 1970s. \"The site is isolated and not threatened by development. As a result, there has not been a sense of urgency,\" he explained.\n\nThat changed with the advent of drone imaging. \"With the recent availability of drone technology, archaeologists detected mathematical patterning in the layout of the holes. This is a spectacular find. Combined with discoveries in the Cañete Valley 75 kilometers north of Inca storage sites with precisely aligned products on the ground in carefully drawn squares, interest in the Band of Holes skyrocketed.\"\n\nProfessor Stanish added that the site has long drawn public fascination, but reliable data was scarce. \"The site has always been very prominent in the pseudoarcheology world with rampant speculation and mischaracterization of the data on the ground. One of the benefits of scientific work is the debunking of unsubstantiated claims that in many ways deprive Indigenous peoples' rightful ownership of their past.\"\n\nMapping the Andes' Hidden Patterns\n\nBefore drone surveys, it was nearly impossible to grasp the site's structure from ground level or even from nearby hills because of the persistent coastal haze. \"Until drone technology, the site of Monte Sierpe/Band of Holes was extremely difficult to map on the surface. One simply cannot get an accurate impression of the structured nature of the hole segments, even from the top of the mountain behind due to the permanent haze in the area,\" said Stanish.\n\nHe added, \"Furthermore, there were very few artifacts on the ground making it difficult to determine a date for the site. Once we had precision, low-altitude images it was immediately clear that this site was profoundly important and had to be scientifically studied.\"\n\n\"Now that we have established that this site was for storage and redistribution, our University of South Florida team will conduct additional work to determine the range and origins of the various plants, particularly the medicinal ones,\" Professor Stanish said. \"With every identification of a new plant type, the Band of Holes becomes more intriguing.\"\n\nThe research received support from a Franklin Research Grant, the University of South Florida Office of the Dean, and the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at the University of California, Los Angeles. The team also thanked the Peruvian Ministry of Culture for its research permit (000318-2024-DCIA-DGPA-VMPCIC/MC). Open access funding was provided by the University of Sydney.",

For many years, scientists have wondered why these holes were made and what they were used for.\n\n**What happened** – A team of researchers from the University of Sydney used drone technology and soil analysis to study Monte Sierpe in detail. They found that the holes likely began as a busy marketplace before the Inca Empire, where people traded goods like corn and cotton. Later, the Incas may have turned the site into a system for keeping records and managing resources across their empire.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it shows how ancient Indigenous people in the Andes used the land not just for farming or defense, but as a center for trade and organization. The site’s layout even matches the design of an Inca khipu, a tool for recording information. This helps us better understand how early societies communicated and managed their communities.\n\n**What's next step** – The research team plans to study more plants found at the site, including medicinal ones, to learn more about the goods traded and the people who used Monte Sierpe.

Now, Nataliya Shakhovska is steering Lviv Polytechnic National University’s 35,000 students and 2,500 academic staff members through the fourth year of the Russian invasion, on top of her research on artificial intelligence.\n\nGlobal geopolitics should not stall science — 5 ways to push back\n\nShakhovska told Nature how she keeps going and how she’s trying to build up her university to be ‘the best in Europe’.\n\nHow do you feel about being the university’s first female rector?\n\nThis is incredible. It signals that leadership can and should reflect academic diversity and that the most important criterion is qualification, not gender. And it is a trend across Ukraine. In the past year, women have also won leadership elections at the Kyiv Aviation Institute and the Vasyl Stefanyk Carpathian National University in Ivano-Frankivsk.\n\nIn our society, mothers and women have strong roles. The war is a crisis and maybe there is a feeling that a woman can protect us.\n\nYou want your university to lead in Europe. How will you achieve that?\n\nYes, I believe in the transformative power of ambition. Moreover, Ukrainian universities have long been underestimated. Our intellectual resilience, especially in times of crisis, is extraordinary. In my mind, the best university is the one that is the best place for people. We’re not just talking about rankings but about the feeling that ‘I like to spend my time here, not only for work or education, but also because this is a good place for me’.\n\n‘Education is possible in any situation’ — what I’ve learnt from teaching in Kyiv amid a war\n\nBrain drain is a problem in Ukraine. That’s why it is important to show our young people that they can and must stay in the country, not only for education but also for their future careers and to rebuild it.\n\nWe need sustained investment in research infrastructure. We need new laboratories and — importantly — deeper international partnerships. We need a culture that rewards innovation and inter-disciplinary thinking. But above all, we need to trust it’s possible, and act accordingly.\n\nYour university was bombed in July. What were the consequences?\n\nThe event was not just about the damaging of labs and classrooms: those can be rebuilt. It was about the emotional trauma to students and staff members. And it was about the mobilization of students and staff. Our community understands that we must rebuild, we must continue our work, we must continue our studying. Universities are not only the buildings: they are first of all the people.\n\nHow have you kept the community together and motivated?\n\nWe are replacing all of the damaged windows. We have raised funds from our partner companies to repair our labs. And for our community, we organized a psychological-support group for students and academics.\n\nWe have had to think about a trauma- informed educational model. We are a huge university and it is difficult to know whether any particular student is affected by trauma. We have a psychological-support centre for our students. It is busy all the time.\n\nResearchers at Lviv Polytechnic National University in Ukraine are developing hydrogel bandages for treating people with burns and other wounds.Credit: Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nWe are also holding a lot of motivational lectures — about new possibilities and time management — and meetings with successful people, not only Ukrainian professors, but also international ones. We organize workshops and courses on non-academic topics for students.\n\nI think these measures are working. Our academic staff members are highly motivated: they want to create something new.\n\nThe war has forced your university to innovate — how so?\n\nConventional education is about lectures, about labs, about practical issues. But having to deal with trauma as well as problems such as access to electricity and materials, it is important that we have a flexible model for our students and staff members.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nThat’s why we first reviewed our educational facilities. We are currently focusing on opening co-working zones where students and staff members can spend their free time and do their work, and on 24-hour lab access for everyone. In the AI department, students can now access the lab at any time.\n\nAnd we try to organize ways for our staff members to connect with our international partners. This is one of the most important parts of our strategy. And it is not about emergency support. It is about long-term integration into European research frameworks. This is, I think, the most important innovation.\n\nTo what extent has your university’s research pivoted during the war?\n\nBecause our economy is working on post-war recovery scenarios, we are having a radical reorganization of research agendas to support this. It is not about publishing papers: we are helping to rebuild the country. We have a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nThe most important thing for Ukraine now is the development of technologies, for example, drone systems and energy resilience. For instance, one project is upcycling bomb-damaged concrete into high-quality concrete for reconstruction. It’s funded by the UK government’s InnovateUkraine programme; our engineers have trained using equipment from the University of Leeds, and a mobile rubble-processing line has begun trials near Kyiv. The benefits include carbon dioxide savings, lower construction costs and simpler logistics for reconstruction.\n\nYour output of scientific papers is prolific. How do you manage this?",
