      "summary": "A cutting-edge therapy using base-edited immune cells is offering a major breakthrough for patients with one of the toughest forms of blood cancer, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. By precisely rewriting tiny sections of DNA, scientists at UCL and Great Ormond Street Hospital created universal CAR T-cells capable of targeting the cancer without harming themselves—a long-standing challenge in T-cell–based therapies. Early trial results show deep, long-lasting remissions, including in patients who had exhausted standard treatment options.",
      "content": "A new treatment created by scientists at UCL (University College London) and Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) is offering promising results for children and adults with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a fast-moving and uncommon blood cancer. The approach uses genome-edited immune cells to target the disease in patients who often have very limited treatment options.\n\nThis first-of-its-kind gene therapy, known as BE-CAR7, relies on base-edited immune cells to attack types of T-cell leukemia that historically could not be treated effectively. Base-editing is an advanced form of CRISPR that changes individual DNA letters inside living cells with high precision.\n\nIn 2022, researchers at GOSH and UCL used this technology to treat Alyssa, a 13-year-old girl from Leicester, marking the first time a base-edited therapy had been used in a patient anywhere in the world.\n\nSince then, the treatment has been given to eight more children and two adults at GOSH and King's College Hospital (KCH).\n\nClinical trial results show strong remission rates\n\nFindings from the early clinical trial have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine and shared at the 67th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. Key outcomes reported by the research team include:\n\n82% of patients reached very deep remission after receiving BE-CAR7, which allowed them to move forward to a stem cell transplant without detectable disease\n\n64% remain free of leukemia, and the earliest treated patients have now been disease-free and off therapy for three years\n\nSide effects such as low blood counts, cytokine release syndrome and rashes were expected and manageable, although the highest risks were linked to viral infections while the immune system was rebuilding\n\nHow CAR T-cell therapy works\n\nCAR-T cell immunotherapy has become an important option for several blood cancers. The process modifies a patient's T-cells so they carry a customized protein called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). This receptor helps the modified cell identify unique markers or \"flags\" on cancer cells and destroy them.\n\nDeveloping CAR T-cell therapies for leukemias that originate in T-cells has been especially difficult. The challenge is that the treatment must wipe out cancerous T-cells without triggering the engineered cells to attack one another.\n\nBase-editing enables the creation of universal CAR T-cells\n\nBE-CAR7 T-cells are created with a next-generation genome editing method that does not cut DNA, which lowers the chances of chromosomal damage. Using CRISPR-based tools, researchers altered single DNA letters to reprogram the cells. In 2022, these edits allowed the team to produce banked stores of \"universal\" CAR T-cells that can be delivered to different patients and still recognize and attack T-cell leukemia.\n\nFor this study, the universal CAR T-cells came from the white blood cells of healthy donors. The engineering steps took place in a clean room facility at GOSH using custom RNA, mRNA and a lentiviral vector in an automated system the team previously refined. Key steps included:\n\nRemoving existing receptors so donor cells can be stored and given to any patient without the need for a match, creating \"universal\" T-cells\n\nRemoving the CD7 marker that identifies cells as T-cells (CD7 T-cell marker). Without removing CD7, T-cells designed to kill T-cells would destroy one another in \"friendly-fire\"\n\nRemoving CD52, a second marker. This alteration prevents a strong antibody medication used to suppress the immune system from eliminating the engineered cells\n\nAdding a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) that detects CD7 on leukemic T-cells. A disabled virus provided extra DNA instructions so the cells can find and attack CD7-positive leukemia\n\nFrom cancer clearance to immune rebuilding\n\nWhen patients receive base-edited CAR T-cells, the engineered cells quickly locate and destroy T-cells throughout the body, including the cancerous ones. If leukemia is cleared within the first month, patients then undergo a bone marrow transplant that restores a functioning immune system over the following months.\n\nProfessor Waseem Qasim, who led the research and is professor of cell and gene therapy at UCL and honorary consultant immunologist at GOSH, said: \"We previously showed promising results using precision genome editing for children with aggressive blood cancer and this larger number of patients confirms the impact of this type of treatment. We've shown that universal or 'off the shelf' base-edited CAR T-cells can seek and destroy very resistant cases of CD7+ leukemia.\"\n\nHe added: \"Many teams were involved across the hospital and university and everyone is delighted for patients clearing their disease, but at the same time, deeply mindful that outcomes were not as hoped for some children. These are intense and difficult treatments -- patients and families have been generous in recognizing the importance of learning as much as possible from each experience.\"\n\nNew hope for patients who do not respond to standard therapy\n\nDr. Rob Chiesa, a study investigator and bone marrow transplant consultant at GOSH, said: \"Although most children with T-cell leukemia will respond well to standard treatments, around 20% may not. It's these patients who desperately need better options and this research provides hope for a better prognosis for everyone diagnosed with this rare but aggressive form of blood cancer.\n\n\"Seeing Alyssa go from strength-to-strength is incredible and a testament to her tenacity and the dedication of an array of small army of people at GOSH. Team working between bone marrow transplant, hematology, ward staff, teachers, play workers, physiotherapists, lab and research teams, among others, is essential for supporting our patients.\"\n\nDr. Deborah Yallop, consultant hematologist at KCH, said: \"We've seen impressive responses in clearing leukemia that seemed incurable -- it's a very powerful approach.\"\n\nFunding expands access to more T-ALL patients\n\nThe trial is sponsored by GOSH and supported by the Medical Research Council, Wellcome and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR). Patients eligible for NHS care who are interested in taking part should speak with their healthcare team.\n\nGOSH Charity has also committed funding to support treatment for an additional 10 T-ALL patients. This more than £2m investment helps broaden access to the trial and contributes to GOSH Charity's fundraising campaign for a new Children's Cancer Centre designed to advance cutting-edge research.\n\nAlyssa's recovery continues to inspire progress\n\nAlyssa Tapley, now 16, became the first person in the world to receive a base-edited cell therapy. She shared her story in 2022, when her leukemia was undetectable but she remained under careful monitoring. She has since moved to long-term follow-up and is fully engaged in daily life with her friends.\n\nShe was diagnosed with T-cell leukemia in May 2021 after months of what appeared to be repeated viral illnesses and fatigue. Standard treatments such as chemotherapy and a first bone marrow transplant did not work, and discussions about palliative care had begun when the research team offered the experimental therapy.\n\nAlyssa said: \"I chose to take part in the research as I felt that, even if it didn't work for me, it could help others. Years later, we know it worked and I'm doing really well. I've done all those things that you're supposed to do when you're a teenager.\n\n\"I've gone sailing, spent time away from home doing my Duke of Edinburgh Award but even just going to school is something I dreamed of when I was ill. I'm not taking anything for granted. Next on my list is learning to drive, but my ultimate goal is to become a research scientist and be part of the next big discovery that can help people like me.\"\n\nResearch infrastructure and continued support\n\nBE-CAR7 cells were manufactured through a long-term research program at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, led by Professor Qasim, who also serves as an honorary consultant at GOSH. Support from NIHR, Wellcome, the Medical Research Council and GOSH Charity has helped drive the development of innovative genome editing treatments.\n\nThe team now operates from the Zayed Centre for Research into Rare Disease in Children, a partnership between UCL and GOSH made possible through a £60 million gift in 2014 from Her Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak in honor of her late husband, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.\n\nThe researchers expressed their thanks to Anthony Nolan and to the volunteer blood and stem cell donors, as well as the patients and families who chose to take part in this work.",

      "content": "A new rapid test from Northwestern University can diagnose hepatitis C in just 15 minutes -- far faster than current options.\n\nChronic hepatitis C infection affects an estimated 50 million people around the world and leads to approximately 242,000 deaths each year, most often from cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\nSame-day test results can speed up the start of treatment, and the infection is fully curable with the right medication.\n\nScientists at Johns Hopkins independently verified that the new test showed 100 percent agreement with commercial diagnostic platforms.\n\nA New 15 Minute Test Speeds Up Hepatitis C Detection\n\nScientists at Northwestern University have created the fastest method so far for identifying hepatitis C virus (HCV). The new diagnostic delivers accurate results in only 15 minutes -- up to 75 percent faster than other rapid HCV options. This shorter wait time is important because it allows many patients to begin treatment before leaving their appointment, reducing the chance of severe complications and deaths linked to delayed care.\n\nThe research describing the test is scheduled for publication on Dec. 10 in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\nWhy Faster Diagnosis Matters for Global Hepatitis C Control\n\nHCV can progress to chronic hepatitis C infection, a condition that affects about 50 million people worldwide and leads to roughly 242,000 deaths each year. Most of these deaths result from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although highly effective medications can cure the infection in 8 to 12 weeks, treatment rates remain low. One major barrier is limited access to affordable, easy to use diagnostic tools that can be deployed at the point of care.\n\n\"We were able to develop a diagnostic test that can be performed at the point of care during a patient's clinical visit, which could enable same-day diagnosis and treatment in support of HCV elimination efforts,\" said Sally McFall, co-director of the Center for Innovation in Global Health Technologies (CIGHT) at Northwestern University McCormick School of Engineering, who developed the test.\n\nAccording to McFall, the new tool has shown strong analytical and clinical results. She noted that it may help support the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating HCV by 2030.\n\nHow the Rapid PCR Test Was Developed\n\nThe project brought together faculty in engineering and infectious disease at Northwestern. To build the new rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, the team relied on the DASH® (Diagnostic Analyzer for Specific Hybridization)PCR platform. Originally designed at Northwestern to detect COVID from nasal swabs, the system proved flexible enough to process whole blood samples for HCV detection.\n\nTo validate the technology, the researchers sent DASH® analyzers and DASH® HCV cartridges to colleagues at Johns Hopkins University. The Johns Hopkins team tested 97 clinical specimens and reported a 100 percent match between the DASH results and commercial diagnostic platforms.\n\n\"This test could revolutionize HCV care in the U.S. and globally by dramatically improving diagnosis, accelerating treatment uptake and enabling more people to be cured faster,\" said study co-author Dr. Claudia Hawkins, director of the Robert J. Havey, MD Institute for Global Health's Center for Global Communicable and Emerging Infectious Diseases at Northwestern. \"By reducing delays and simplifying testing pathways, it has the potential to save millions of lives from the devastating liver-related complications of untreated HCV.\"\n\nWhy the New Test Outperforms Current Options\n\nDiagnosing hepatitis C typically requires two steps. An antibody test first determines whether a patient has ever been exposed to the virus. If that test is positive, a follow-up PCR test checks for viral RNA to confirm an active infection. In most clinical settings, the PCR sample must be sent to an outside laboratory, leading to delays that can stretch from several days to weeks. Patients then need to return to their provider for results. Although the Food and Drug Administration has cleared one other point-of-care HCV test, it still requires 40 to 60 minutes -- a time frame that often exceeds the length of a standard appointment, McFall said.\n\nThe study is titled, \"Development of a Rapid Automated Point-of-Care Test for Hepatitis C Viral RNA on the DASH(r) Rapid PCR System.\"",

An antibiotic called zoliflodacin might be part of a solution\n\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria J Marshall/Tribaleye Images / Alamy\n\nDrug-resistant gonorrhoea is on the rise worldwide, but a new antibiotic could buy us more time before the emergence of completely untreatable strains of the bacteria, which is known to potentially raise the risk of infertility.\n\nThe sexually transmitted infection is estimated to affect more than 80 million people worldwide annually. It occurs when the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae infects various body parts, including the anus, urethra and genitals. Common symptoms include a burning sensation when urinating and unusual discharge from the vagina or penis. If left untreated, it can cause infertility and pregnancy loss.\n\nThe disease is usually treated with injectable ceftriaxone, the last antibiotic that works against most N. gonorrhoeae strains – but the bacterium is evolving resistance to this drug too. For instance, the World Health Organization found that, across 12 countries including Thailand, South Africa and Brazil, about 5 per cent of cases were ceftriaxone-resistant in 2024 – a sixfold increase since 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf ceftriaxone fails, doctors usually turn to other antibiotics, but it’s only a matter of time until completely untreatable strains evolve. “We are running out of options,” says Alison Luckey at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership. “It’s been decades since a gonorrhoea drug has been approved.”\n\nAttempting to stall this growing threat, researchers previously found that gepotidacin, an antibiotic pill used against urinary tract infections, can effectively treat gonorrhoea, with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expected to make an approval decision on using the drug in the US today. But since bacteria usually evolve resistance to new drugs, the more treatment options we have, the better, says Luckey.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Health Check Expert insight and news on scientific developments in health, nutrition and fitness, every Saturday. Sign up to newsletter\n\nShe and her colleagues have now tested another drug, zoliflodacin, which was specifically developed to treat drug-resistant gonorrhoea. The researchers randomly assigned 744 people with gonorrhoea – from the US, South Africa, Thailand, Belgium and the Netherlands – to take either zoliflodacin, or a combination treatment involving ceftriaxone and another antibiotic called azithromycin.\n\nBy swabbing participants’ cervix or urethra six days later, on average, the researchers found that zoliflodacin had cleared about 91 per cent of the infections, while the equivalent figure was 96 per cent among those who received standard treatments. This means there was no significant difference between the treatments. Side effects, such as headache and nausea, were similar and transient in both groups.\n\nThe vast majority of the 744 cases were caused by strains that weren’t resistant to ceftriaxone or azithromycin. But a prior study showed that, in a lab dish, zoliflodacin is effective against gonorrhoea strains resistant to all standard antibiotics. As such, the results add to evidence that zoliflodacin could offer a fresh approach against gonorrhoea, not just as a first-line treatment but potentially when standard drugs fail, says Luckey. “In places where you’re looking at frequent risk of resistance, there may be a greater appetite to use it sooner as a first-line treatment,” she says. What’s more, the drug – which is taken orally – could offer a more convenient way to treat gonorrhoea than ceftriaxone, which some people avoid due to a fear of needles, she says.\n\nThe researchers have already submitted their data to the FDA, which is expected to make an approval decision on 15 December, says Luckey.\n\nIf this is positive, approvals elsewhere, including in the UK, Europe and Asia, will probably follow soon after, says Charlotte-Eve Short at Imperial College London, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\nTogether with ongoing efforts to vaccinate against gonorrhoea, with the meningitis group B vaccine recently being rolled out in the UK against gonorrhoea, gaining two new drugs could mark a turning point in the fight against drug-resistant gonorrhoea, says Short. “This is great news,” she says. “We have yet to see on a population level what this could mean, but if we’re coming at it from two different directions – we’ve got prevention and we’ve got treatment – we should be able to make a bigger impact on reducing resistance.”",

It infects areas like the genitals and urethra and can cause pain when urinating and unusual discharge. If untreated, it can lead to serious problems like infertility. The bacteria are becoming resistant to many antibiotics, making treatment harder.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists tested a new antibiotic called zoliflodacin on 744 people with gonorrhoea from several countries including the US, South Africa, and Thailand. They compared zoliflodacin to the usual treatment, which is a combination of antibiotics including ceftriaxone. After about six days, zoliflodacin cured 91% of infections, close to the 96% cure rate of standard treatment. Side effects were mild and similar for both groups. Zoliflodacin is taken as a pill, unlike ceftriaxone, which requires an injection.\n\n**Impact** – This new drug could become an important tool to fight gonorrhoea, especially as the bacteria become resistant to current medicines. It works well even against some strains that resist all other antibiotics, according to lab tests. Since it is taken by mouth, it may be easier for patients who fear needles. Having more treatment options helps prevent the bacteria from becoming untreatable.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers have sent their results to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which will decide by mid-December whether to approve zoliflodacin for use. If approved, other countries like the UK and those in Europe and Asia may also allow the drug soon. Meanwhile, efforts to prevent gonorrhoea with vaccines are also increasing, which could work together with new treatments to control the infection.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new oral antibiotic, zoliflodacin, may soon offer an effective and easier-to-use treatment against drug-resistant gonorrhoea, helping to tackle a growing health problem worldwide.",
      "personality_title_fr": "Un nouvel antibiotique prometteur contre la gonorrhée résistante aux médicaments",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – La gonorrhée est une infection sexuellement transmissible courante causée par la bactérie Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Elle infecte des zones comme les organes génitaux et l’urètre, provoquant des douleurs en urinant et des écoulements inhabituels. Non traitée, elle peut entraîner des problèmes graves comme l’infertilité. La bactérie devient résistante à de nombreux antibiotiques, rendant le traitement plus difficile.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des scientifiques ont testé un nouvel antibiotique appelé zoliflodacine sur 744 personnes atteintes de gonorrhée dans plusieurs pays, dont les États-Unis, l’Afrique du Sud et la Thaïlande. Ils ont comparé la zoliflodacine au traitement habituel, une combinaison d’antibiotiques incluant la ceftriaxone. Après environ six jours, la zoliflodacine a guéri 91 % des infections, proche des 96 % du traitement standard. Les effets secondaires étaient légers et similaires dans les deux groupes. La zoliflodacine se prend en comprimé, contrairement à la ceftriaxone qui s’injecte.\n\n**Impact** – Ce nouveau médicament pourrait devenir un outil important contre la gonorrhée, surtout avec la résistance croissante aux traitements actuels. Il fonctionne bien même contre certaines souches résistantes à tous les autres antibiotiques, selon des tests en laboratoire. Pris par voie orale, il pourrait être plus facile pour les patients qui ont peur des aiguilles. Avoir plus d’options de traitement aide à empêcher la bactérie de devenir totalement résistante.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs ont envoyé leurs résultats à la Food and Drug Administration (FDA) américaine, qui doit décider mi-décembre d’approuver ou non la zoliflodacine. En cas d’approbation, d’autres pays comme le Royaume-Uni, l’Europe et l’Asie pourraient aussi rapidement autoriser le médicament. Parallèlement, la prévention par vaccin contre la gonorrhée progresse, ce qui pourrait, avec les nouveaux traitements, mieux contrôler l’infection.\n\n**En une phrase** – Un nouvel antibiotique oral, la zoliflodacine, pourrait bientôt offrir un traitement efficace et plus simple contre la gonorrhée résistante aux médicaments, aidant à lutter contre ce problème de santé croissant dans le monde.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – La gonorrea es una infección de transmisión sexual común causada por la bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Infecta zonas como los genitales y la uretra, causando dolor al orinar y secreciones inusuales. Si no se trata, puede causar problemas graves como infertilidad. La bacteria está volviéndose resistente a muchos antibióticos, lo que dificulta el tratamiento.\n\n**Qué ocurrió** – Científicos probaron un nuevo antibiótico llamado zoliflodacina en 744 personas con gonorrea de varios países, incluidos Estados Unidos, Sudáfrica y Tailandia. Compararon la zoliflodacina con el tratamiento estándar, que es una combinación de antibióticos incluyendo ceftriaxona. Después de unos seis días, la zoliflodacina curó el 91% de las infecciones, casi igual que el 96% con el tratamiento estándar. Los efectos secundarios fueron leves y similares en ambos grupos. La zoliflodacina se toma en pastilla, a diferencia de la ceftriaxona que es inyectable.\n\n**Impacto** – Este nuevo medicamento podría ser una herramienta importante para combatir la gonorrea, especialmente porque la bacteria se está volviendo resistente a los medicamentos actuales. Funciona bien incluso contra algunas cepas resistentes a todos los demás antibióticos, según pruebas de laboratorio. Al tomarse por vía oral, puede ser más fácil para pacientes que temen las agujas. Tener más opciones de tratamiento ayuda a evitar que la bacteria se vuelva completamente resistente.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores enviaron sus resultados a la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de EE. UU. (FDA), que decidirá a mediados de diciembre si aprueba la zoliflodacina. Si se aprueba, otros países como Reino Unido, Europa y Asia probablemente permitirán su uso pronto. Mientras tanto, también avanzan los esfuerzos para prevenir la gonorrea con vacunas, lo que junto con nuevos tratamientos puede ayudar a controlar mejor la infección.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Un nuevo antibiótico oral, la zoliflodacina, podría ofrecer pronto un tratamiento efectivo y más fácil de usar contra la gonorrea resistente a medicamentos, ayudando a enfrentar un problema de salud creciente en todo el mundo.",

      "summary": "A World Health Organization (WHO) expert committee has again confirmed that there is no causal link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), following a new review of global scientific evidence.",
      "content": "Meeting on 27 November, the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety examined 31 major research studies published between 2010 and August 2025.\n\nThe analysis covered data from multiple countries and looked both at vaccines in general and at those containing thiomersal – a preservative sometimes used to prevent contamination in multi-dose vials.\n\n‘Positive safety profile’\n\nAccording to the committee, the latest review “strongly supports the positive safety profile of vaccines used during childhood and pregnancy” and “confirms the absence of a causal link with autism spectrum disorders”.\n\nTweet URL\n\nExperts also reviewed concerns about certain vaccines that contain very small amounts of aluminium salts, which help the body create a stronger immune response.\n\nThis assessment drew on studies published over more than two decades, as well as a large national study from Denmark that tracked children born between 1997 and 2018.\n\nThe WHO committee concluded that the evidence “shows no association between the trace amounts of aluminium used in some vaccines and ASD”, stressing that these ingredients have been used safely for many decades.\n\nFollowing the review, the group reaffirmed earlier findings issued in 2002, 2004 and 2012: “Vaccines, including those with thiomersal and/or aluminium, do not cause autism.”\n\nWHO urged governments to ensure that vaccine policies remain rooted in science, noting that “global childhood immunisation efforts represent one of the greatest achievements in improving lives, livelihoods and the prosperity of societies”.\n\nOver the past 50 years, WHO estimates that vaccines have saved at least 154 million lives.\n\nDebate in the US\n\nThe update follows a WHO statement issued on 24 September, following renewed political debate in the United States. That statement warned against reviving discredited theories linking vaccines to autism, stressing that “a robust, extensive evidence base exists showing childhood vaccines do not cause autism”.\n\nStudies suggesting otherwise, WHO said at the time, were flawed and have long been debunked.\n\nWHO reiterated that decades of independent research reach the same conclusion: vaccines are safe, effective and critical to public health.\n\nThe organization said it will continue reviewing emerging evidence and advising countries based on the strongest available science.",
