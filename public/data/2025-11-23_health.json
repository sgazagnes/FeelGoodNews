      "summary": "A new nasal-delivered nanotherapy shows promise against aggressive glioblastoma tumors. By activating the STING immune pathway using gold-core spherical nucleic acids, researchers were able to reach the brain without invasive surgery. When paired with drugs that boost T-cell activity, the treatment eliminated tumors in mice and built long-lasting immunity. The results suggest a powerful new direction for brain cancer immunotherapy.",
      "content": "Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, working with scientists at Northwestern University, have created a noninvasive strategy to treat one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of brain cancer. Their method relies on carefully designed nanostructures made from extremely small materials that can carry potent cancer-fighting compounds into the brain through simple nasal drops. In studies involving mice, this approach successfully treated glioblastoma by stimulating the brain's immune system. The technique also avoids the invasiveness seen in similar treatments now under development.\n\nThe findings were published this month in PNAS.\n\nWhy Glioblastoma Is So Difficult to Treat\n\nGlioblastoma develops from astrocytes, a type of brain cell, and is the most common malignant brain tumor, affecting about three in every 100,000 people in the U.S. The disease advances rapidly and is almost always fatal. One of the biggest obstacles to treating it is the challenge of getting effective medicine into the brain.\n\n\"We wanted to change this reality and develop a noninvasive treatment that activates the immune response to attack glioblastoma,\" said Alexander H. Stegh, PhD, a professor and vice chair of research in the WashU Medicine Taylor Family Department of Neurosurgery and a co-corresponding author of the study. Stegh also serves as research director of The Brain Tumor Center at Siteman Cancer Center, based at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and WashU Medicine. \"With this research, we've shown that precisely engineered nanostructures, called spherical nucleic acids, can safely and effectively activate powerful immune pathways within the brain. This redefines how cancer immunotherapy can be achieved in otherwise difficult-to-access tumors.\"\n\nReactivating the Immune System With STING Pathway Nanomedicine\n\nGlioblastoma is often labeled a \"cold tumor\" because it does not naturally provoke a strong immune response. Unlike \"hot tumors,\" which are more responsive to immunotherapies, glioblastoma tends to evade detection. Scientists have been exploring ways to stimulate a pathway known as STING, short for stimulator of interferon genes. This pathway activates when cells detect foreign DNA, setting off immune defenses.\n\nPrevious research showed that drugs activating the STING pathway can prime the immune system to attack glioblastoma. The drawback is that these drugs degrade quickly and must be injected directly into the tumor to be effective. Since multiple doses are needed, this requires highly invasive procedures.\n\n\"We really wanted to minimize patients having to go through that when they are already ill, and I thought that we could use the spherical nucleic acid platforms to deliver these drugs in a noninvasive way,\" said Akanksha Mahajan, PhD, a postdoctoral research associate in Stegh's lab and first author of the study.\n\nBuilding Gold-Core Nanostructures for Nose-to-Brain Delivery\n\nTo address this challenge, Stegh's group partnered with co-corresponding author Chad A. Mirkin, PhD, director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology and the Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern University. Mirkin developed spherical nucleic acids, which are nanoscale particles coated densely with DNA or RNA. These structures have been shown to be more effective than traditional delivery systems.\n\nTogether, the teams designed a specialized version of spherical nucleic acids featuring gold nanoparticle cores and short DNA fragments that activate the STING pathway in targeted immune cells. To move these compounds into the brain, the researchers used the nasal passages as the entry point.\n\nIntranasal delivery has been studied before for brain-targeted treatments, but no nanoscale therapy had previously shown the ability to activate immune responses against brain tumors using this route.\n\n\"This is the first time that it has been shown that we can increase immune cell activation in glioblastoma tumors when we deliver nanoscale therapeutics from the nose to the brain,\" Mahajan said.\n\nTracking Nanodrops as They Travel to the Brain\n\nThe researchers aimed to demonstrate both selective delivery to the brain and proper activation of the target immune cells. They added a molecular tag to the spherical nucleic acids that glowed under near-infrared light. After administering the nanodrops to mice with glioblastoma, they observed the particles traveling along the pathway of the main nerve connecting the facial region to the brain.\n\nOnce there, the immune response triggered by the nanomedicine concentrated in specific immune cells within the tumor. Some activity was also detected in nearby lymph nodes. Importantly, the therapy did not spread widely throughout the body, helping reduce the likelihood of unwanted side effects.\n\nFurther examination showed that immune cells in and around the tumor had activated the STING pathway, enabling them to mount a stronger attack against the cancer.\n\nCombining Treatments to Eradicate Tumors and Prevent Recurrence\n\nWhen the nanotherapy was paired with medicines that help activate T lymphocytes, another key type of immune cell, the two-dose treatment eliminated tumors in mice and produced long-lasting immunity that prevented the cancer from returning. These outcomes were significantly better than those seen with current STING-targeting therapies.\n\nStegh noted that stimulating the STING pathway alone is unlikely to cure glioblastoma. The tumor uses several tactics to weaken or shut down the immune response. His group is exploring ways to build additional immune-activating features into their nanostructures, which could allow multiple therapeutic targets to be addressed through a single treatment.\n\n\"This is an approach that offers hope for safer, more effective treatments for glioblastoma and potentially other immune treatment-resistant cancers, and it marks a critical step toward clinical application,\" Stegh said.\n\nStudy Funding and Disclosures\n\nThis work was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the NIH (grant numbers P50CA221747 and R01CA275430), the NIH (grants R01CA120813, R01NS120547, and R01CA272639), the Melanoma Research Foundation, the Chicago Cancer Baseball Charities at the Lurie Cancer Center of Northwestern University and grants from Cellularity, Alnylam, and AbbVie.

      "summary": "A massive real-world study comparing tirzepatide and semaglutide reveals both drugs deliver strong, early cardiovascular protection—reducing heart attack, stroke, and death in adults with type 2 diabetes. While companies have claimed large differences favoring their own medications, researchers found only modest distinctions between the two blockbuster GLP-1 drugs.",
      "content": "A research team at Mass General Brigham has released new evidence directly comparing how well tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) and semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) protect the heart. According to the analysis, both medications lowered the chances of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause. The study appears in Nature Medicine, and the findings were also presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2025.\n\nEarlier studies had already shown that semaglutide lowers the likelihood of major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. What had remained uncertain was whether tirzepatide, another widely used treatment for type 2 diabetes, offers similar protection.\n\nLarge Real-World Dataset Offers New Clarity\n\nTo investigate this, researchers examined national health insurance claims and compared cardiovascular outcomes among nearly one million adults using tirzepatide, semaglutide, or other type 2 diabetes therapies.\n\n\"Randomized controlled trials are often considered the reference standard in the medical evidence generation process. However, not all questions can be answered using this time- and resource-intensive method,\" said first author Nils Krüger, MD, a research fellow in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. \"Data generated in clinical practice and used secondarily for research allow us to address a wide range of clinically relevant questions time- and resource-effectively -- when applied correctly. Moreover, we can study patients who reflect the reality of everyday clinical care, in contrast to the highly selected participants of randomized experiments.\"\n\nRisk Reductions Seen in Both Medications\n\nThe results showed measurable cardiovascular benefits among people with type 2 diabetes who were at higher risk for heart-related complications. When compared with sitagliptin, a diabetes medication known to have a neutral effect on cardiovascular outcomes, semaglutide lowered the combined risk of heart attack and stroke by 18 percent. Tirzepatide produced a 13 percent reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death when compared with dulaglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been on the market for many years.\n\n\"Both drugs show strong cardioprotective effects. Our data also indicate that these benefits occur early, suggesting that their protective mechanisms go beyond weight loss alone,\" said Krüger. Although the study highlights strong results, the biological pathways behind these heart-protective effects are still not fully understood.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparisons Show Only Small Differences\n\nSince these medications are relatively new, scientists continue to investigate how they protect the heart, especially in studies that directly compare tirzepatide and semaglutide. Krüger noted that \"According to recently presented database analyses by the respective manufacturers, each company's own drug appears to reduce cardiovascular risk much more effectively than the competitor's.\" He added, \"However, our study found only small differences between tirzepatide and semaglutide in cardiovascular protection among populations at risk of adverse events, underscoring that both agents provide protective benefit and could be integrated into clinical cardiovascular practice.\"\n\n\"We hope that our study will help clinicians better understand how these new medications work in clinical practice.

Early results show the treatment is safe and can significantly improve vision, even in severely affected patients. Participants gained measurable sight improvements in the treated eye. Researchers are now monitoring higher-dose groups as the therapy advances toward later trial phases.",
      "content": "In the United States, age-related macular degeneration is one of the most common causes of permanent vision loss in adults who are 60 and older. It affects the macula, the central region of the retina that contains tightly packed cells used for sharp, detailed color vision.\n\nRoughly 20 million adults in the country are living with some form of AMD. People with this condition typically lose the ability to see objects directly in front of them, although their peripheral vision remains intact. Available therapies can slow how the disease progresses, but none of them can restore lost vision.\n\nExploring a New Cell-Based Approach\n\nIn a study published in Cell Stem Cell, scientists tested retinal pigment epithelial stem cells in a phase 1/2a clinical trial. The cells were obtained from adult postmortem eye tissue. These early-stage trials are designed to determine whether a treatment can be safely administered.\n\nAMD occurs in two forms: dry and wet. More than 90% of patients have the dry type, which develops when retinal pigment epithelial cells begin to malfunction and eventually die.\n\nIn the early stages of AMD, these cells no longer work correctly. At more advanced stages, they die and cannot regenerate. As the condition worsens, multiple regions in the central retina lose these essential cells.\n\nTransplanting Specialized Stem Cells\n\nIn the current study, individuals with advanced dry AMD received transplants of specialized stem cells originally sourced from eye-bank tissue. These adult stem cells were limited in function and could only mature into retinal pigment epithelial cells.\n\nSix participants were given the lowest dose of the treatment (50,000 cells) during an eye surgery. The procedure proved safe, with no serious inflammation or tumor growth reported in any of the patients.\n\nEarly Signs of Vision Improvement\n\nParticipants also showed vision improvements in the treated eye, while their untreated eye did not show the same changes. This difference suggests that the technique itself may hold therapeutic potential. \"Although we were pleased with the safety data, the exciting part was that their vision was also improving,\" said Rajesh C. Rao, M.D., Leonard G. Miller Professor of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, and an associate professor of pathology and human genetics. \"We were surprised by the magnitude of vision gain in the most severely affected patients who received the adult stem cell-derived RPE transplants. This level of vision gain has not been seen in this group of patients with advanced dry AMD.\"\n\nWhen tested on a standard eye chart, the low-dose group was able to read 21 additional letters one year after treatment.\n\nNext Steps in the Clinical Trial\n\nThe research team is now monitoring 12 more participants who received higher doses of 150,000 and 250,000 cells. If no safety issues are identified, the investigators plan to move on to later stages of the clinical trial.\n\n\"We are grateful to all our participants who are allowing to better understand whether this intervention is safe enough to be a future therapy,\" Rao said. \"These kinds of NIH-funded studies can help us offer advanced treatments in the field of regenerative medicine, and we are happy we can offer this first-in-human, cutting-edge clinical trial at the University of Michigan.\"\n\nAbout Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is a condition that gradually damages the macula, the small but vital area at the back of the eye that supports sharp central vision. The disease typically develops as people get older, and it is more common in individuals over 60.\n\nThere are two primary forms of AMD. The dry form appears most often and involves the slow breakdown of retinal cells that help the eye process detail and color. The wet form is less common but progresses more quickly and involves abnormal blood vessel growth under the retina.\n\nOver time, both types can cause blind spots in central vision, making activities such as reading and identifying faces increasingly difficult. While current treatments can slow the disease, scientists have been searching for ways to restore the lost cells, which is why stem cell research has become a promising direction.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – La degeneración macular relacionada con la edad (DMAE) es una enfermedad común en adultos mayores de 60 años en Estados Unidos. Daña la mácula, la parte del ojo necesaria para la visión central clara, haciendo que las personas pierdan la capacidad de ver lo que está directamente frente a ellos. La mayoría tiene la forma seca, que destruye lentamente células importantes de la retina y no tiene tratamiento para recuperar la visión perdida.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Un nuevo ensayo clínico probó trasplantes de células madre adultas para tratar la DMAE seca avanzada. Estas células madre fueron tomadas de tejido ocular donado y trasplantadas en los ojos de seis pacientes durante una cirugía. El ensayo mostró que el tratamiento es seguro, sin efectos secundarios graves. Después de un año, los pacientes que recibieron la dosis más baja pudieron leer 21 letras más en una tabla de visión, mostrando mejoras reales en la vista.\n\n**Impacto** – Este ensayo es el primero en demostrar que las células madre adultas pueden mejorar de forma segura la visión en personas con DMAE seca avanzada, un grupo que normalmente no recupera la vista perdida. Las mejoras fueron sorprendentes, especialmente en pacientes con daño grave. Este avance abre una nueva forma de restaurar células importantes de la retina en lugar de solo frenar la enfermedad.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores ahora están probando dosis más altas de células madre en más pacientes y observan cuidadosamente la seguridad y eficacia. Si los resultados continúan positivos, el ensayo avanzará a etapas posteriores, acercando este tratamiento a más personas.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Por primera vez, la terapia con células madre adultas ha ayudado de forma segura a pacientes con DMAE seca avanzada a mejorar su visión, abriendo la puerta a nuevos tratamientos para millones afectados por esta enfermedad.",

      "title": "Scientists reveal a hidden hormone switch for learning",
      "summary": "Researchers uncovered how estrogen subtly reshapes learning by strengthening dopamine reward signals in the brain. Rats learned faster when estrogen levels were high and struggled when the hormone’s activity was blocked. The findings help explain how hormonal cycles influence cognitive performance and psychiatric symptoms. This connection offers a new path for understanding brain disorders tied to dopamine.",
      "content": "Scientists have known for many years that hormones can shape how the brain works, affecting emotions, mental energy, and everyday choices. What remains unclear is exactly how these chemical signals bring about such changes.\n\nA recent investigation offers new insight by examining the role of estrogen, a hormone central to the female reproductive cycle. Through controlled experiments using laboratory rats, researchers found that the brain processes involved in learning and decision-making shift naturally throughout the cycle. These shifts appear to stem from molecular changes linked to dopamine, the chemical messenger behind the \"reward\" signals that help the brain learn.\n\nThe study appears in the journal Nature Neuroscience.\n\nHow Estrogen May Shape Cognitive Function\n\n\"Despite the broad influence of hormones throughout the brain, little is known about how these hormones influence cognitive behaviors and related neurological activity,\" explains Christine Constantinople, a professor in New York University's Center for Neural Science and the senior author of the paper. \"There is a growing realization in the medical community that changes in estrogen levels are related to cognitive function and, specifically, psychiatric disorders.\"\n\nCarla Golden, an NYU postdoctoral fellow and the paper's lead author, adds, \"Our results provide a potential biological explanation that bridges dopamine's function with learning in ways that better inform our understanding of both health and disease.\"\n\nLaboratory Tests Reveal Estrogen's Effects\n\nThe research team, which also included scientists from NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Neuroscience Institute and Virginia Commonwealth University's Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, monitored brain activity in rats while the animals completed a set of learning tasks.\n\nThe rats learned to reach a \"reward\" -- in this case, access to water -- after recognizing audio cues that indicated when water would be available and how much they would receive.\n\nPerformance improved when estrogen levels were elevated. According to the authors, estrogen increases dopamine activity in regions of the brain responsible for reward processing, strengthening the signals that support learning.\n\nLower Estrogen Levels Reduce Learning Ability\n\nWhen estrogen activity was reduced, limiting its influence on dopamine regulation, the rats learned less effectively. These findings suggest a possible link between hormone fluctuations and symptoms seen in certain neuropsychiatric disorders. The team also emphasized that estrogen's influence did not extend to decision making; only learning was affected.\n\n\"All neuropsychiatric disorders show fluctuations in symptom severity over hormonal states, suggesting that a better understanding of how hormones influence neural circuits might reveal what causes these diseases,\" notes Constantinople.\n\nThis research was funded by the National Institutes of Health (DP2MH126376, F32MH125448, 5T32MH019524, 1S10OD010582-01A1), the National Cancer Institute (P30CA016087), NYU Langone Health, and the Simons Foundation.
