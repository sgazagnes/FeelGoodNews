      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nOur Best of 2025 Education stories reflect a growing global commitment to reimagining how we learn, teach, and grow. These five highlights explore new models, inspiring individuals, and bold ideas that bring equity and creativity into classrooms and beyond.\n\nWater lentils, a protein-packed and environmentally friendly plant, have officially been approved as a vegetable in Europe, offering a promising contribution to the protein transition and global food security. However, for this tiny but mighty plant to make a real impact, both food producers and consumers must first embrace it.\n\nFrom duckweed to dinner plate\n\nMost people might recognize water lentils as duckweed, the small, green plants that float and multiply rapidly in stagnant water. While commonly consumed in Thailand and other parts of Asia, they have yet to gain popularity in the West, despite being referenced as early as 1644 in a Dutch herbal book as ‘Water Linsen oft Enden Groen’ (Water Lentils or Duckweed).\n\nThat might be about to change.\n\nSenior researcher Dr. Ingrid van der Meer of Wageningen Plant Research first became interested in water lentils a decade ago. “They have a number of biological processes that differ from those of other plants,” she explained. “From a scientific point of view, water lentils are very intriguing.” Over time, her fascination deepened. “They grow quickly, are suitable for contained cultivation, and their dry weight contains massive amounts of protein. I thought: why don’t we eat this?”\n\nA sustainability powerhouse\n\nIn many ways, water lentils are the ideal vegetable for a more sustainable future. “They are an exceptionally sustainable vegetable,” said Van der Meer. “They are cultivated on water and don’t need many nutrients. Of course, water is a precious commodity, but in a simple greenhouse or vertical farm, growers can use it very efficiently.”\n\nUnlike traditional crops, water lentils require no farmland, making them ideal for indoor farming, even in urban environments. Additionally, they grow exponentially, much like yeast, doubling every three days. With proper cultivation, they can yield over six times more protein per hectare than soy, according to calculations by Wageningen University & Research (WUR). And the best part? They require no pesticides.\n\nPacked with nutrition and taste\n\nWith increasing calls to adopt plant-based diets for both health and environmental reasons, water lentils are well-positioned to play a key role. Not only are they rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, but they also contain a perfect balance of essential amino acids, making them a highly nutritious leafy green.\n\nBut how do they taste? According to WUR studies, taste panels gave water lentils high marks. “They have a plant-like, slightly nutty flavor and have a nice bite despite their size,” researchers found. In various test dishes that included soup, stew, ravioli, and pesto, panel members responded positively, encouraging chefs to explore their culinary potential.\n\nOvercoming regulatory roadblocks\n\nDespite their potential, water lentils faced significant legal hurdles before gaining approval in the European Union. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) classified them as a ‘novel food,’ meaning they required extensive scientific research and regulatory approval before hitting the market.\n\n“It takes immense amounts of time and money to submit a novel food request,” Van der Meer noted. Determined to see water lentils widely accepted, she and her colleagues at Wageningen Research compiled a comprehensive dossier proving their safety. With support from the Wellcome Trust in London and the Goeie Grutten foundation, the researchers successfully met EFSA’s stringent requirements, including demonstrating that water lentils could be cultivated with manganese levels comparable to spinach.\n\nTheir persistence paid off. In 2021, EFSA approved the consumption of Wolffia, the type of water lentil traditionally eaten in Thailand, under more relaxed guidelines. Now, with the recent approval of the Lemna variety, European consumers have a new sustainable food option.\n\nBringing water lentils to market\n\nWith regulatory barriers cleared, the next challenge is commercial production. Currently, water lentils are not cultivated at scale within the EU. However, other countries are already taking the lead. In Israel, they are marketed as ‘green caviar,’ while a U.S.-based start-up founded by two Dutch entrepreneurs is working on extracting protein from the plant.\n\nSince 2022, Wageningen University has been coordinating efforts to bring together industry players to explore sustainable production methods such as vertical farming. The goal is to integrate water lentils into mainstream food products, whether fresh, frozen, or as an ingredient in pasta, cheese, smoothies, or plant-based meat substitutes.\n\nConsumer acceptance: the final hurdle\n\nWhile researchers and food industry leaders work on supply, they are also looking at demand. “We need to keep the consumer in mind,” Van der Meer emphasized. “We won’t continue the project if people don’t want to eat water lentils.”\n\nTo gauge public interest, Wageningen Food & Biobased Research conducted extensive consumer studies. Over 1,000 participants were surveyed based on background information and product images, while others took part in taste tests. Initial hesitation gave way to approval. After just a couple of days, participants found water lentils as enjoyable as spinach. In fact, some even preferred water lentil soup to its spinach-based counterpart.\n\nYet, the biggest challenge remains: getting food companies to take the leap. “It’s a chicken and egg situation,” Van der Meer admitted. “Are food companies waiting for interested consumers, or can consumers only develop a taste for this product once it’s available?”\n\nOne thing is clear: if water lentils gain recognition as quickly as they grow, they might soon become a staple on European plates.\n\nDid this solution from 2025 stand out to you?

      "content": "China's BYD overtakes Tesla as world's top EV seller\n\n13 hours ago Share Save Osmond Chia , Business reporter and Danielle Kaye , Business reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nChina's BYD has overtaken Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival in annual sales. Tesla car sales dropped by nearly 9% in 2025 to 1.64 million vehicles sold worldwide, the carmaker said on Friday - its second consecutive year of falling car deliveries. Those figures placed Tesla behind BYD, which said on Thursday that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million. The US firm has faced a tough year with a mixed reception to new offerings, unease over Musk's political activities and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.\n\nTesla's car sales fell 16% during the last three months of 2025. The drop was partly due to the repeal of a government subsidy that had helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,570) off the price of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles. Wall Street analysts have recently lowered their Tesla sales estimates for 2026, signalling an increasingly gloomy outlook. Chinese firms such as Geely, MG, and BYD - now the country's largest electric car company - have put pressure on Western rivals by pricing their vehicles below established brands. In October, Tesla responded by launching lower-priced versions of its two best selling models in the US in a bid to boost sales. Musk, who is already the world's richest man, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package. The deal, which was approved by shareholders in November, could see him getting a payout of as much as $1tn (£740bn). As part of the agreement, Musk also has to sell a million humanoid robots over the next ten years. Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\". Analysts say Tesla's robotaxi and self-driving rollout in 2026, which has helped send its share price to a record high, will be crucial to its overall performance. Though there are big questions surrounding Tesla self-driving ambitions, some remain optimistic. Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities says Tesla will own about 70% of the self-driving market over the next decade \"as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope\" of the firm. Besides Tesla, Musk's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels. Those commitments, along with running US President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) early last year, led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla. Musk has since stepped back from his role in the US government.\n\nDespite BYD's rise in recent years, its sales growth slowed in 2025 to the weakest rate in five years, in part due to fierce competition in China, its key market. And despite BYD surpassing Tesla when it comes to car sales, the US firm has remained more profitable in recent quarters. Still, BYD remains a global EV powerhouse as its prices often undercut rival carmakers. The Shenzhen-based company's rapid expansion - especially in Latin America, South East Asia and parts of Europe - comes despite many countries imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EVs. In October, BYD said the UK had become its biggest market outside China. The firm said that its sales in Britain surged by 880% in the year to the end of September, driven by strong demand for the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U sports utility vehicle (SUV).",

      "content": "Controversial post-Brexit farm subsidy scheme 'landmark moment for Wales'\n\n23 hours ago Share Save Steffan Messenger Wales environment correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC Dairy farmer Gethin Hughes said he had decided to sign up to the scheme\n\nWales' controversial post-Brexit subsidy scheme for farmers has come in, almost a decade after the vote to leave the EU. It will provide payments with a greener focus and see farms agree to a checklist of requirements. Farms have to actively manage at least 10% of their land as habitat to join, and while some have land that qualifies, many dairy farmers say they don't. Farming union NFU Cymru warned the protest-hit scheme still needed work, but after an \"enormous rollercoaster\" ride it was now \"acceptable to the industry\".\n\nGetty Concerns about the Sustainable Farming Scheme contributed to a wave of protests by farmers across Wales in 2024\n\nRural affairs secretary Huw Irranca-Davies called it \"a landmark moment for Wales\" and said an early test would be how many farmers sign up. New Year 2026 is \"really significant\" for Welsh agriculture, said Abi Reader, NFU Cymru's deputy president, who owns a dairy farm in Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan. \"This is a once in a generation change to farm support payments and there's a lot of expectation riding on this,\" she said. For decades farms had received more than £300m a year in EU subsidies, shared out largely based on how much land they had. Getting a replacement plan in place after Brexit - known as the Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS) - had been \"an absolutely enormous rollercoaster\", Ms Reader said. Unions had branded earlier versions of the government's plans as \"unworkable\" and they contributed to a wave of protests in 2024, including the largest ever seen outside the Senedd. After further negotiations, final details were unveiled this summer. Farms joining the SFS will have to commit to 12 so-called universal actions in exchange for their entry-level payment. These range from maintaining hedgerows and reducing pesticide use to attending online courses on sustainable farming practices. Additional funding would be available for more ambitious environmental work and farms working together. \"I think we're largely pleased with the framework now, but there are still a number of tweaks [to be made] and we still need a budget that will reflect inflation and really deliver for farms and for the countryside,\" Ms Reader said. Farmers now have to prepare to apply for the new scheme by 15 May. Alternatively they could stick to their old subsidies as they are phased out, but see a 40% cut to their payments this year.\n\nThe number of farms who sign up would \"absolutely\" be the first indicator of the scheme's success, said Abi Reader of NFU Cymru\n\nDairy farmer Gethin Hughes, of Ffostrasol in Ceredigion said he had decided to join the SFS. The payments would help provide \"a little bit of security\" in the face of volatile milk prices, he explained. Though the scheme was now \"much better\" than it had been, it continued to divide opinion, he said. Farms have to actively manage at least 10% of their land as habitat to join and Mr Hughes said he was fortunate to have some land available that would qualify. But \"a lot of my friends who are dairy farmers are saying they can't join as they don't have the habitat land\", he said. \"They'll have to cut back on cows and there's no point them carrying on farming then.\"\n\nEnvironmentalists say habitat land can still be grazed and used productively, and having more of it helps make farms more resilient to extreme weather. They worry the SFS may ultimately end up not being ambitious enough. The entry-level payment would only help farmers \"maintain\" the habitats and wildlife they already have, according to Arfon Williams, of RSPB Cymru. The big environmental benefits would come from additional funding pots - known as the scheme's optional and collaborative layers, he argued. \"We need to develop those upper layers of the scheme as quickly as possible,\" he said, pointing to the Welsh government's target to stop the loss of biodiversity by 2030. \"Farmers have a huge role in restoring nature but only if they've got the tools and the support to do the job,\" he said.\n\nDeputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies said \"bringing the SFS into a reality\" was \"a significant achievement\". On being handed the rural affairs brief in March 2024 in the wake of major protests, he announced a further delay to the scheme's introduction and set up roundtable groups with farmers and environmentalists to work through the areas of disagreement. \"We've got something that we've co-designed together, and it's also a dynamic scheme that we can adjust as time goes forward,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean everyone's 100% happy - they're not - we were never going achieve that. \"But I think we've got something we can be really proud of here and I just want to encourage everybody as we step into the new year to go and have a good look at this now.\" The government had not set \"an arbitrary target\" for how many farms it wanted to join the SFS in the first year, but those numbers would be one sign of success, he said.\n\nGetty Images More than 90% of the land area of Wales is given over to farming",

This change comes after Brexit, when Wales stopped receiving payments from the European Union.\n\n**What happened** – The Sustainable Farming Scheme began recently after many years of planning and talks. Farmers who join must manage at least 10% of their land as natural habitat and follow 12 basic rules, like caring for hedgerows and reducing pesticide use. The program offers payments to farmers who meet these requirements, with extra money for those who do more to help the environment. Farmers had until May 15 to apply. Some farmers, like dairy farmer Gethin Hughes, have joined and see the payments as helpful for their uncertain income.\n\n**Impact** – This is an important change because it encourages farmers to protect nature while farming. It is the first time Welsh farm support focuses on the environment so clearly. The scheme was created after discussions between farmers, government, and environmental groups, showing cooperation to find a balance.

Le programme a été créé après des discussions entre agriculteurs, gouvernement et groupes environnementaux, montrant une coopération pour trouver un équilibre. Il vise aussi à aider le Pays de Galles à atteindre des objectifs comme l'arrêt de la perte de biodiversité d'ici 2030. Cependant, certains agriculteurs s'inquiètent de ne pas pouvoir participer faute d’habitats suffisants, et certains écologistes souhaitent que le programme soit encore plus ambitieux.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le succès du programme dépendra du nombre d’agriculteurs qui s’inscrivent et de l’amélioration de l’environnement. Le gouvernement prévoit d’ajuster le programme dans le temps, en ajoutant plus de soutien pour ceux qui veulent faire un effort supplémentaire pour la nature. Agriculteurs et responsables continueront à travailler ensemble pour améliorer le dispositif et soutenir à la fois l’agriculture et la biodiversité.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – Le Pays de Galles a lancé une nouvelle subvention agricole qui récompense les pratiques plus écologiques et la gestion des habitats, marquant une étape importante vers une agriculture durable après le Brexit.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Gales ha comenzado un nuevo programa de subsidios agrícolas llamado el Esquema de Agricultura Sostenible (EAS). Reemplaza al antiguo sistema que pagaba principalmente según la cantidad de tierra que tenían los agricultores. Este cambio llega tras el Brexit, cuando Gales dejó de recibir pagos de la Unión Europea.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El Esquema de Agricultura Sostenible comenzó recientemente después de varios años de planificación y negociaciones. Los agricultores que se unan deben gestionar al menos el 10 % de sus tierras como hábitat natural y seguir 12 reglas básicas, como cuidar los setos y reducir el uso de pesticidas. El programa ofrece pagos a quienes cumplen estas normas, con dinero extra para quienes hacen más por el medio ambiente. Los agricultores tenían hasta el 15 de mayo para solicitarlo. Algunos, como el ganadero de leche Gethin Hughes, se han unido y ven los pagos como una ayuda frente a ingresos inestables.\n\n**Impacto** – Este cambio es importante porque anima a los agricultores a proteger la naturaleza mientras cultivan. Es la primera vez que el apoyo agrícola en Gales se centra claramente en el medio ambiente. El programa se creó tras discusiones entre agricultores, gobierno y grupos ambientales, mostrando cooperación para encontrar un equilibrio. También busca ayudar a Gales a cumplir objetivos como detener la pérdida de biodiversidad para 2030. Sin embargo, algunos agricultores temen no poder unirse si no tienen suficiente tierra de hábitat, y algunos ambientalistas desean que el programa sea aún más ambicioso.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El éxito del esquema se verá en cuántos agricultores se inscriben y cómo mejora el medio ambiente. El gobierno planea seguir ajustando el programa con el tiempo, ofreciendo más apoyo a quienes quieran hacer más por la naturaleza. Agricultores y autoridades continuarán trabajando juntos para mejorar el esquema y apoyar tanto la agricultura como la vida silvestre.\n\n**Frase resumen** – Gales ha lanzado un nuevo subsidio agrícola que premia prácticas más ecológicas y el cuidado de hábitats, marcando un paso importante hacia una agricultura sostenible tras el Brexit.",
