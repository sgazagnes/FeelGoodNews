      "summary": "Ten years after its first edition and its author’s arrest, a book which adapts philosopher Gene Sharp’s work has a new edition. GV spoke with the author, Domingos da Cruz.",
      "content": "Editor’s note: The author of this text is also a contributor to the new edition of the book by interviewee Domingos da Cruz.\n\nIn June 2015, Domingos da Cruz, a journalist and human rights defender, and other activists were detained under suspicion of “planning a coup d'état” after attending a conference discussing his book on peaceful methods of protest and civil resistance. The conference was led by Da Cruz, and the group of 17 activists became known as the “15+2” group.\n\nTen years later, Da Cruz has released a new edition of “Tools to Destroy the Dictator and Avoid a New Dictatorship – A Political Philosophy of Liberation for Angola,” which includes analyses from several academics and discusses tools of civil resistance. The work, according to a 2015 Deutsch Welle report “is an adaptation of the 168 techniques presented by the American philosopher Gene Sharp in the book From Dictatorship to Democracy.”\n\nThe title summarizes the purpose of the work, which aims to provide civil resistance methods for authoritarian contexts, such as those of Angola and Mozambique. In these, “academia should promote human dignity and that means confronting the dictatorship with practical solutions,” said Da Cruz in an interview with Global Voices.\n\nIn 2015, Da Cruz was remanded in custody for six months, he was “let go” to house arrest for about three months, and was then convicted along with other activists. He was released in June 2016. Since then, he has been living between Portugal, Sweden, and Canada where he was a visiting researcher at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture, at the University of Concordia, and has been coordinating the Media Observatory (Observatório da Imprensa), a civil society organization that aims to monitor and evaluate the performance of Angolan media.\n\nAt that time, Angola’s president was José Eduardo dos Santos, who stayed in power for nearly four decades (1979–2017) and died in 2022. He was succeeded by the current president, João Lourenço, from the same party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).\n\nIn the Human Rights Watch’s 2025 report, the organization listed problems Angola currently faces, such as police brutality and chronic malnutrition among children, highlighting:\n\nO presidente João Lourenço assinou leis que não atendem aos padrões internacionais de direitos humanos e que restringem severamente as liberdades de imprensa, de expressão e de associação. As prisões angolanas continuaram a sofrer com a superlotação.\n\nPresident João Lourenço has signed off on laws that do not meet international human rights standards and that severely restrict freedoms of the press, expression, and association. Angolan prisons continued to suffer from overcrowding.\n\nThe new version of Da Cruz’s work revisits ideas discussed in the first edition, published in 2015, now expanded with contributions from Brazil (Susan De Oliveira and Fernanda Cris Franco), Mozambique (Nelson Domingos António, Tirso Sitoe, and Edgar Barroso) and Angola (Raul Tati), in a collective effort to refine strategies of action against political oppression.\n\nIn May this year, as French outlet RFI reported, the book was censored in Angola, which led the author to make it available for free online.\n\nThe transition of power\n\nDa Cruz starts from the observation that “the reality of Angola’s authoritarianism requires concrete answers, and that relying on elections organized by authoritarian regimes would be falling into a trap.” According to him, in such contexts, there is no possibility for a transition of power as would typically be expected in democracies.\n\nNo caso de Angola, colocaria todos os partidos de lado pois eles não representam uma solução revolucionária. Agora, dentro da sociedade civil, talvez seja necessário que haja unidade da sociedade civil para que possa elaborar dois ou três grandes planos estratégicos, que seriam um conjunto de táticas para desencadear uma revolução popular. Especificamente, educação informal da sociedade em que é preciso vigilância para preservação da liberdade, mas também educação para a confrontação de um regime autoritário.\n\nIn Angola’s case, I would not count on any of the current parties because they do not represent a revolutionary solution. Now, within civil society, maybe there needs to be unity among the civil society [organizations] so that they can develop two or three major strategic plans [of action], which would be a set of tactics to bring about a popular revolution. Specifically, informal education about a society in which vigilance is needed to preserve freedom, but also education for confronting an authoritarian regime.\n\nDa Cruz points to the example of Mozambican rapper and activist Azagaia, who passed away in 2023, and whose music made social commentary that inspired demonstrations, which were met with police repression. He makes a comparison with the Angolan context, where he perceives the artists as being focused on the symptoms of the dictatorship, by talking about arbitrary arrests, high levels of poverty, corruption, manipulation of the media, and a general lack of basic services:\n\nÉ preciso que se produzam músicas que digam claramente ao povo que, para que nos possamos livrar, é necessário desencadear uma revolução popular. Logo, isso seria um projeto coletivo em que as pessoas juntam a sua força para o alcance da democracia e derrubar a ditadura. O que há em Angola não são eleições, são simulações para legitimar o poder. Muitos acreditam que estão numa democracia, mas vivem numa ilusão.\n\nWe need to make songs that clearly tell the people that, to free ourselves, it’s necessary to start a popular revolution. So, this would be a collective project in which people join their strengths to achieve democracy and overthrow the dictatorship. What there is in Angola is not elections, it’s rehearsals to legitimize the power [in place]. Many believe they are in a democracy, but they live in an illusion.\n\nIn the country’s last elections in 2022, the civil society movement Mudei carried out an initiative — “Citizen Electoral Monitoring Project” — and incorporated activists and citizens from various parts of Angola who contributed to the unofficial counting of the election results. These results highlighted a disparity with the official results, which showed the MPLA winning with more than 80 percent of the vote against UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), and which the opposition contested.\n\nJust like Mozambique’s FRELIMO (Mozambique Liberation Front), both the MPLA and UNITA have their roots in movements dating back to the struggle for independence from Portugal, which later evolved into political parties.\n\nMudei also assessed press coverage at the time of the elections. In its report, they said there was unequal treatment and that the press gave more attention to the party in power, the MPLA. Da Cruz said:\n\nEm Angola não é possível falar de eleições livres, justas e transparentes.\n\nIn Angola it’s not possible to talk about free, fair, and transparent elections.\n\nHe also observed that tools of civil resistance, such as protests, boycotts, and holding vigils, have been used in government transitions, such as in Tunisia, during the Arab Spring, and could be adapted and employed in other contexts.\n\nIn Mozambique, for example, Da Cruz sees similarities with Angola and has been sharing the book with Mozambican activists and academics, as they too are faced with an authoritarian-inclined government formed by the party FRELIMO. In the run-up to elections in 2019, Mozambican journalists and activists were the target of threats.\n\nMore exchanges and raising awareness\n\nDa Cruz believes it is urgent to promote deeper political and philosophical exchanges between Portuguese-speaking countries. Although still limited, he has noticed a deepening of the links between civil societies, as seen during the protests in Mozambique after the 2024 elections, which inspired protests against the socio-economic crisis in Angola.\n\nHe also cites examples such as Turkey, where the president, Recep Erdoğan, in power for over 20 years, adding his time as prime minister and president, has become more authoritarian over time, to highlight that no democracy is invulnerable:\n\nA liberdade não é definitiva. As democracias também caem. É preciso educar as novas gerações sobre isso e manter uma sociedade civil vigilante e ativa.\n\nFreedom is not guaranteed. Democracies can also fall. It is necessary to educate new generations about this and maintain a vigilant and active civil society.\n\nIn order to achieve this, the writer highlights the role of accessible media, such as content published on social media, where citizen art or sharing articles can be used to raise awareness around issues.\n\nReturning to his work a decade later, in the current context of Lusophone Africa, he says he hopes readers will not only read, but also adopt the tools and put them into practice.\n\nNão basta conhecer a receita. É preciso pôr a mão na massa. Só assim a liberdade será conquistada e defendida.",

      "summary": "Works that highlight the violence against Black bodies, exalt beauty in the midst of chaos, [show] the exotic, are still common representations of poverty, and what translates into saleable art.",
      "content": "This article, written by Léu Britto, was originally published on Agência Mural’s website on May 25, 2025. An edited version is republished here by Global Voices under a partnership agreement.\n\nAmid heated debates about the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its possible impact on the art market, a question arises: will experience and creativity still have a place in photography from urban peripheral areas? These doubts followed me in the days leading up to May 10, when three other photography enthusiasts and I promoted another edition of FotoBeco (Alley Photos), an exhibition featuring images produced by photographers from São Paulo’s peripheral neighbourhoods.\n\nEvery two months, Rogério Vieira, my partner at Sérgio Silva Gallery, and I make a selection to present a photographic series in an alley located on the way out of the Monte Azul Favela, in southern São Paulo. It is a free, public exhibition of the selected artists’ work.\n\nEach artist wins a free print of their work on a canvas of 4 × 2 metres, displaying a synopsis of the piece to members of the public passing by.\n\nWe also launched the fan magazine “BECO-Volume 1,” in partnership with the publisher Selo Vertigem, which brought together 30 images from people who believe in the importance of our mission for photography, resisting the market’s modus operandi and its hierarchical commercial structure.\n\nStreets and alleys\n\nMy story with photography has two major milestones. The first was in 2007, when I left high school, torn between studying mechanical engineering and journalism. The choice came after photographing, albeit as an amateur, an event known as the State Meeting of the Homeless of São Paulo State.\n\nThere, the president of the event, Robson Mendonça, showed me a part of the population facing a situation as difficult as that of life in the favelas — those who didn’t even have a roof over their heads. After that meeting, I decided to fight against the further erasure of marginalized people, of whom I am a part.\n\n\n\nThe second milestone came a few years later, in 2013, after college, with the Women's Popular Union from Campo Limpo and Surrounding Areas. This institution supported cultural initiatives and the fight for human rights along with the Solano Trindade Popular Agency of Culture, with which I work to this day. That’s how I bought my first professional camera, a second-hand one, which would stay with me for seven years.\n\nAnd my journey into photography turned into a resistance against the erasure of the idea of how we, as residents of the peripheries, imagine what we are, how we live, and what we think of this unequal world, since our streets and alleys. Be it against the omission of the state or of art that doesn't like to highlight the reality we suffer, or the lack of doors open to us in the bubbles of already established art markets.\n\nIn the commercial art market, it seems guaranteed that we won’t even set foot there, unless it’s through the 1 percent quota reserved for Black people, the impoverished, and favela residents.\n\nA market made in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, photography may not be seen as something for people from poorer neighbourhoods, but we continue making and sharing it anyway. This point resonates with the reality of the Brazilian photography market, where, when a portfolio is analyzed, the origin of the photographer and their academic background often seem to carry more weight than the work itself.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2023, I was managed by a curator who tried to include me in the market. One day, a client of hers who was buying some photographs saw a photo from my 2021 book “A Gambiologia da Sevirologia” [The Art of Getting By]. At first, he went straight past it and didn’t take any interest, but his wife called him back to it: “Wait, this one is different, I've never seen anything like it in your collection, it’s worth acquiring,” she said.\n\nHe asked the curator, “How much is it?” She answered, “BRL 1,000” (around 185 US dollars). He replied, “But who is he? Does he have a CV?” She said: “He has 10 years’ experience; he’s an exponent [of photography] and he has a promising future.” The client said, “As I don't know him, I'll pay BRL 500 for two images.” That same day, he was negotiating the purchase of a series of six photographs by a North American photographer who worked with the people of Peru, and was going to pay 50,000 US dollars for them.\n\nDoes this approach consider representation, the breaking of stereotypes, and the power of [including] perspectives from the peripheries in photography? I remember the words of Maria Luiza Meneses, an art curator, who wrote the preface to our zine. “These are photographs that widen the ways of seeing São Paulo’s peripheries, [which are] equally important for the transformation of the collective imaginary.”\n\nA Black professional, she reiterates how this photography can itself be a tool for changing others’ and art markets’ perceptions of these areas.\n\nThose who make this bridge between realities are the new photographers whose images come from a common starting point: their own expression of the reality lived within peripheral neighbourhoods, across the country.\n\nWe no longer need “colonizers” to come and record our daily lives; it has been some time since we have been able to do it ourselves. And our local people acknowledge our efforts through the breaking down of cliches about ourselves.\n\nThe fight against stereotypes\n\nWith each edition of FotoBeco, since December 2023, our determination has strengthened: we show what we record,in the fight against negative stereotypes about our neighbourhoods — favelas, peripheries, and marginalized places — something still unvalued by the market.\n\nWorks that highlight the violence against Black bodies, exalt beauty in the midst of chaos, [show] the exotic, are still common representations of poverty, and what generally translates into saleable art.\n\nWhen we are among them, when they allow us to be there, in general, we cause fright, strangeness, a certain unease. Our origin does not allow creativity and art, only destruction and tragedy, according to the “validators” [of art]. It’s that clichéd way of looking at us: “Wow, how talented you are, in the middle of nothing,” Or “It was your individual effort that enhanced your look.”\n\nThis May 2025, even with the rain, over 50 people came to appreciate the works we selected from 200 applications. “The number, perspectives and diversity of images received are an indication of the place that the peripheries occupy in contemporary photographic interest,” Meneses concluded.\n\nI was certain of this as I walked toward the alley. And I wasn’t alone.\n\n“I'm from Taboão da Serra (in São Paulo) and I remember well when I just had a desire to take photographs. I hardly knew the profession; I had no references from people from my neighbourhood who had managed to get there. It seemed out of reach,” said Tuane Fernandes, another member of the selecting panel.\n\nFor the established market, most photographers originating in the poorer neighbourhoods, like us, are still disorganized beginners who do not really know what we are trying to express. And then we have the verse from Racionais, one of Brazil's most significant rap groups: “Us here, you there, everybody in their place. Got it?”\n\nMy feeling is that this market is only now adapting to our generation, which has come up, qualified, and delivers what they think we should produce. Only we are going further; we are tired of waiting. We are getting ourselves out there, as we say. Creating our networks, opening galleries, doing our festivals, building our collections, and setting the prices of our own works of art.\n\nThe reality is there’s no more waiting for the sun to rise. When they say it’s daytime, we are already up well before [that]. We are the generation that eats fresh fruit because we wake up earlier.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In São Paulo, Brazil, photographers from poor and peripheral neighborhoods often face exclusion from the traditional art market. Their work is usually overlooked or valued less, and their communities are often shown only through negative stereotypes like poverty and violence.\n\n**What happened** – Since December 2023, a group of photographers has organized FotoBeco, a public photo exhibition held in an alley near a favela in southern São Paulo. They display large prints of their photos for free, showing real life from their neighborhoods. They also created a magazine featuring 30 photographers to share their work beyond usual art spaces. This movement resists the usual art market rules and challenges how people see their communities.\n\n**Impact** – These photographers are changing the way their neighborhoods are shown and understood. Instead of images that focus only on violence or poverty, they highlight beauty, culture, and everyday life. They break stereotypes and prove that creativity and art belong to them. Their work helps others see São Paulo’s peripheries in a new light and pushes the art world to be more open and fair.\n\n**What's next step** – The group plans to continue FotoBeco exhibitions every two months and expand their magazine. They are building their own networks, galleries, and festivals to support local artists. This growing movement will likely inspire more photographers from marginalized areas to share their voices and create opportunities outside traditional art markets.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Photographers from São Paulo’s poorer neighborhoods are reclaiming their stories through public art, breaking stereotypes, and reshaping the local art scene on their own terms.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – À São Paulo, au Brésil, les photographes des quartiers pauvres et périphériques sont souvent exclus du marché de l’art traditionnel. Leur travail est souvent sous-estimé et leurs communautés sont montrées à travers des stéréotypes négatifs comme la pauvreté et la violence.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Depuis décembre 2023, un groupe de photographes organise FotoBeco, une exposition photo publique dans une ruelle près d’une favela dans le sud de São Paulo. Ils exposent gratuitement de grandes impressions de leurs photos qui montrent la vie réelle de leurs quartiers. Ils ont aussi créé un magazine rassemblant 30 photographes pour partager leur travail en dehors des espaces artistiques habituels. Ce mouvement résiste aux règles habituelles du marché de l’art et remet en question la façon dont on perçoit leurs communautés.\n\n**Impact** – Ces photographes changent la manière dont leurs quartiers sont montrés et compris. Plutôt que de se concentrer uniquement sur la violence ou la pauvreté, ils mettent en avant la beauté, la culture et la vie quotidienne.
