      "content": "King says he can 'share the good news' his cancer treatment will be reduced\n\n7 hours ago Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save\n\nWatch: King Charles issues update on his cancer treatment\n\nKing Charles has shared \"good news\" about his cancer, saying in a personal message that early diagnosis and \"effective intervention\" means his treatment can be reduced in the new year. In a recorded video message broadcast on Channel 4 for the Stand Up To Cancer campaign, the King said: \"This milestone is both a personal blessing and a testimony to the remarkable advances that have been made in cancer care.\" This news that he is responding well to treatment is the biggest update on the King's health since he revealed his diagnosis in February 2024. The type of cancer has not been identified and treatment and monitoring will continue, but he said: \"Early diagnosis quite simply saves lives.\"\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace, the King's recovery has reached a very positive stage and he has \"responded exceptionally well to treatment\", so much so that doctors will now move his treatment \"into a precautionary phase\". The regularity of treatment is going to be significantly reduced - but the King, 77, is not described as being in remission or \"cured\". \"Today I am able to share with you the good news that thanks to early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to 'doctors' orders', my own schedule of cancer treatment can be reduced in the new year,\" the King said in his speech. The video message, recorded in Clarence House two weeks ago, was played in the Stand Up To Cancer show on Channel 4 on Friday evening, in a fundraising project run with Cancer Research UK. The campaign encourages more people to get tested for cancer and to take advantage of national screening schemes - and the King's message emphasised the importance of checks to catch cancer at an early stage. \"I know from my own experience that a cancer diagnosis can feel overwhelming. Yet I also know that early detection is the key that can transform treatment journeys, giving invaluable time to medical teams,\" said the King. Early detection could be a lifesaver, he said: \"Your life, or the life of someone you love, may depend upon it.\"\n\nPA Media King Charles had a message of \"hope\" at an Advent service this week\n\nThe King also spoke of how much he had been \"profoundly moved by what I can only call the 'community of care' that surrounds every cancer patient - the specialists, the nurses, researchers and volunteers who work tirelessly to save and improve lives\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the King's announcement was a \"powerful message\". \"I know I speak for the entire country when I say how glad I am that his cancer treatment will be reduced in the new year,\" he added. Until now the King has said little publicly about his illness. He didn't seem to want to be defined by the disease and his approach has been to keep working, with a busy schedule including overseas trips and hosting state visits, including last week's by the German president. A couple of days ago he was sending a message of optimism and seasonal \"hope\", when he attended an atmospheric, candle-lit Advent service at Westminster Abbey. The Stand Up To Cancer show, presented by celebrities including Davina McCall, Adam Hills and Clare Balding, has urged people not to be frightened of getting cancer checks. In particular, the show has appealed to the estimated nine million people in the UK who Cancer Research UK says are not up to date with NHS screening schemes, offering an online checker to let people see if they are eligible for tests for breast, bowel and cervical cancer.\n\nThe King said it \"troubles me deeply\" that this represents nine million missed opportunities to catch cancer early - and he urged people to use the screening checker online tool. \"The statistics speak with stark clarity. To take just one example: When bowel cancer is caught at the earliest stage, around nine in 10 people survive for at least five years. When diagnosed late, that falls to just one in 10,\" he said. According to royal sources, the King's reference to bowel cancer should not be seen as linked to his own condition, and prostate cancer has previously been ruled out. In an attempt to demystify cancer checks and show the value of early diagnosis the Stand Up To Cancer show had a live broadcast from cancer clinics at Addenbrooke's and Royal Papworth hospitals in Cambridge. \"I want to take the fear out of cancer screening and show everyone that they are not on their own in this,\" said McCall, 58, who recently said she was recovering from breast cancer surgery.\n\nReuters The King has talked about the shock of receiving a cancer diagnosis",

      "personality_title": "King Charles shares hopeful update as his cancer treatment is reduced",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – King Charles, 77, was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. Since then, he has been receiving treatment and monitoring his health closely. Cancer is a serious illness, but early diagnosis can make treatment more effective.\n\n**What happened** – In a video message shared during the Stand Up To Cancer campaign, King Charles announced that his cancer treatment will be reduced in the new year. He explained that thanks to early diagnosis and good medical care, his condition has improved enough for doctors to lessen the intensity of his treatment. The King recorded this message two weeks ago at Clarence House and it was broadcast on Channel 4.\n\n**Impact** – This update is important because it shows how early cancer detection can help patients respond well to treatment. The King’s message also encourages people to take cancer screening seriously, as catching cancer early can save many lives. For example, when bowel cancer is found early, about nine out of ten people live at least five more years, but this drops to one out of ten if found late. The King’s openness helps reduce fear about cancer and promotes health checks.\n\n**What's next step** – The King will continue with a less frequent treatment plan and regular monitoring. The Stand Up To Cancer campaign will keep encouraging people in the UK to use screening services and get tested.

      "title": "Scientists find dark chocolate ingredient that slows aging",
      "summary": "Scientists have uncovered a surprising link between dark chocolate and slower aging. A natural cocoa compound called theobromine was found in higher levels among people who appeared biologically younger than their real age.",
      "content": "A natural chemical in dark chocolate may play a role in slowing certain signs of biological aging. Researchers at King's College London have identified theobromine, a plant compound found in cocoa, as a possible contributor to this effect.\n\nThe study, published on December 10 in Aging, analyzed how much theobromine was present in participants' blood and compared those levels with biological aging markers measured in blood samples.\n\nWhat Biological Age Reveals\n\nBiological age reflects how well a person's body is functioning, rather than the number of years they have lived. This measure is based on DNA methylation, a collection of tiny chemical tags on DNA that shift as we grow older.\n\nThe research team examined data from two European groups, including 509 people from TwinsUK and 1,160 from KORA. Individuals with higher amounts of theobromine in their bloodstream tended to have a biological age that appeared younger than their chronological age.\n\nProfessor Jordana Bell, senior author and Professor in Epigenomics at King's College London, said: \"Our study finds links between a key component of dark chocolate and staying younger for longer. While we're not saying that people should eat more dark chocolate, this research can help us understand how everyday foods may hold clues to healthier, longer lives.\"\n\nTheobromine Stands Out Among Cocoa Compounds\n\nThe team also investigated whether other cocoa or coffee metabolites showed similar patterns. Their results suggested that theobromine was the only compound with this specific association.\n\nTo estimate biological age, the researchers used two approaches. One method examined DNA changes that reflect the pace of aging. The second measured telomere length, which refers to protective structures at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres naturally shorten with age and are linked to age-related health risks.\n\nHow Plant Molecules Influence Aging\n\nMany plant compounds in foods can influence how genes operate by turning them on or off. These compounds, known as alkaloids, can interact with cellular systems that regulate gene activity and contribute to long-term health.\n\nTheobromine is one such alkaloid. Although it is widely known for being toxic to dogs, it has been connected to possible benefits in humans, including a reduced risk of heart disease. Despite this, it has received relatively limited scientific attention until now.\n\nNext Questions for Aging Research\n\nDr. Ramy Saad, lead researcher at King's College London and also affiliated with University College London as a doctor in Clinical Genetics, said: \"This is a very exciting finding, and the next important questions are what is behind this association and how can we explore the interactions between dietary metabolites and our epigenome further? This approach could lead us to important discoveries towards aging, and beyond, in common and rare diseases.\"\n\nThe team, which includes Professor Ana Rodriguez-Mateos, a Professor of Human Nutrition at King's College London, is now examining whether theobromine's effect occurs on its own or if it works alongside other well-known components of dark chocolate such as polyphenols, which are recognized for their positive effects on health.\n\nWhy More Chocolate Is Not a Shortcut\n\nDr. Ricardo Costeira, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at King's College London, said: \"This study identifies another molecular mechanism through which naturally occurring compounds in cocoa may support health. While more research is needed, the findings from this study highlight the value of population-level analyses in aging and genetics.\"\n\nAlthough the findings are encouraging, the researchers caution that increasing dark chocolate consumption is not automatically beneficial. Chocolate also contains sugar, fat and other ingredients, and more work is needed to fully understand how theobromine interacts with the body and how it may influence aging.",

Male mice showed strong inflammatory responses, while females showed none, yet both transmitted pain-inducing signals through their blood. These findings reveal previously unknown pathways driving pain, especially in females. The work points toward new opportunities for personalized chronic pain therapies.",
      "content": "Preclinical research from McGill University suggests that nerve injuries can create long-term changes in the immune system, and these changes may not be the same for males and females.\n\nNerve injuries are common and can occur from stretching, pressure or cuts. They often lead to persistent problems such as chronic pain. Although the immune system normally works to repair damaged tissue, the new findings indicate that nerve injuries can also shift immune activity throughout the entire body.\n\nLaboratory analysis of blood from mice showed clear evidence of bodywide inflammation after a nerve injury. Researchers also found that males and females did not respond in the same way.\n\nDistinct Immune Patterns in Males and Females\n\nIn male mice, inflammatory markers in the bloodstream increased and remained elevated. In female mice, those same markers did not rise at all. Yet when blood taken from injured males or females was transferred into healthy mice, it produced increased sensitivity to pain in both cases. According to the researchers, this means that something in the bloodstream -- although not the same in males and females -- is capable of spreading pain responses throughout the body.\n\n\"That means whatever is causing pain in females is working through a completely different biological pathway that we don't yet understand,\" said co-author Jeffrey Mogil, E.P. Taylor Professor of Pain Studies at McGill and a Distinguished James McGill Professor.\n\n\"By understanding how men and women react differently to nerve injuries, we can work toward more personalized and effective treatments for chronic pain,\" added Sam Zhou, the study's lead author and a PhD student at McGill.\n\nWider Health Implications\n\nThe researchers report that nerve injuries may influence much more than the damaged site. Long-lasting disruptions to immune function could raise the likelihood of chronic pain and potentially contribute to related conditions such as anxiety and depression.\n\n\"Recognizing the full impact of nerve injuries is important for both doctors and patients,\" said Dr. Ji Zhang, the senior author and a professor at McGill's Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery and Faculty of Dental Medicine and Oral Health Sciences. \"A localized nerve injury can affect whole body.

      "content": "Young people in Australia can no longer use popular social media platforms.Credit: David Gray/AFP via Getty\n\nThis week, Australia became the first country to ban children under the age of 16 from using most social-media platforms. Many teenagers in the country are furious, but for social scientists, the policy offers a natural experiment to study the effects of social-media restrictions on young people.\n\nTechnology companies have had a year to come up with ways to stop teenagers in the country using their platforms, including Facebook, X, Reddit, YouTube, Threads and Snapchat. From Wednesday, companies must take reasonable steps to prevent young people from creating or keeping accounts, or risk fines of up to Aus$49.5 million (US$33 million).\n\nDo smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?\n\nOther countries, including France, Denmark and Spain, have introduced social-media restrictions for young people, or announced plans to, but no policy is as far-reaching as Australia’s. Its government says that social media is harming young people’s mental health, causing teenagers to lose sleep because of addictive design features and exposing them to harmful content. But some researchers say the evidence that social media causes harm is mixed. Communicating with peers online is a crucial support system for some young people, particularly those in minority groups and those living in remote areas.\n\nNature spoke to researchers who will study the effects of the ban.\n\nNew avenues of research\n\nFor Susan Sawyer, a physician-researcher specializing in adolescent health at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, the start of the social-media ban this week meant entering the next phase of her research. Over the past two months, Sawyer and her colleagues interviewed 177 teenagers aged 13–16 about their social-media use, screen time and mental health before the ban came into effect. She and her colleagues plan to survey the teenagers again in six months, to see whether the ban has affected their use of the platforms or their mental health. The researchers will also survey the participants’ parents about problematic Internet and social-media use by their children.\n\nAnother research collaboration between the Kids Research Institute Australia, the University of Western Australia and Edith Cowan University, all in Perth, will examine whether the ban is presenting new parenting challenges and what family conflicts have arisen as a result.\n\nAmanda Third, a researcher at Western Sydney University in Australia who studies how children use technology, says the ban is an opportunity to collect data about the effect of policies that restrict young people’s access to the Internet and social media. She is going to investigate how teenagers engage with technology and the Internet, and how their face-to-face interactions might change following the ban.\n\nBut, she says, it might be hard to tell whether any changes are a direct result of the ban or other policies designed to make the Internet safer: for example, later this month, new industry standards will come into effect for tech companies to prevent children being exposed to sexually explicit or violent content on the Internet. The social-media ban could undercut some well-thought-out efforts to keep children on social media and positively impact their experiences online, she says. “The ban is about booting them out.”\n\nZareh Ghazarian, a political scientist at Monash University in Melbourne who studies the role of social media in young people’s political development, says online platforms can be an important way for teenagers to engage with politics. Teachers can discuss contemporary issues, political debates and policy issues that come up on social media, he says. Now that the ban is in place, he plans to interview teachers to find out how it is affecting students’ political knowledge, and what alternative platforms they are turning to. “Part of education is to be able to engage with issues and ideas that may not be covered in the classroom — and that was the benefit social media was bringing,” he says.\n\nUnintended consequences",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Australia has become the first country to stop children under 16 from using most social media platforms. The government aims to protect young people’s mental health by limiting their access to sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat.\n\n**What happened** – Starting this week, tech companies must prevent teenagers under 16 from creating or keeping accounts on popular social media platforms. If they don’t, they face large fines. Researchers had prepared by interviewing hundreds of teens before the ban began and will continue studying how it changes their mental health, family life, social habits, and political interest.\n\n**Impact** – This policy is the most extensive social media restriction for young people worldwide. It offers scientists a rare chance to learn how social media affects teenagers’ well-being and daily life. Some experts are curious if the ban will reduce problems like addiction and harmful content exposure, while others worry it might cut off important social support and political engagement opportunities.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will keep collecting information over the next months to see if the ban improves mental health or causes new issues. They will also check how families and schools adjust to the change and whether teens find other ways to connect online or offline.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Australia’s social media ban for under-16s opens a new path to understand how online platforms influence young people’s minds, friendships, and learning.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L'Australie est devenue le premier pays à interdire aux enfants de moins de 16 ans l'accès à la plupart des réseaux sociaux. Le gouvernement souhaite protéger la santé mentale des jeunes en limitant leur utilisation de plateformes comme Facebook, YouTube et Snapchat.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Depuis cette semaine, les entreprises technologiques doivent empêcher les adolescents de moins de 16 ans de créer ou de garder des comptes sur ces réseaux, sous peine d'amendes importantes. Des chercheurs ont interrogé des centaines d'adolescents avant l'interdiction et vont continuer à étudier l'impact sur leur santé mentale, la vie familiale, les interactions sociales et l'intérêt politique.\n\n**Impact** – Cette politique est la plus stricte au monde pour les jeunes. Elle offre aux scientifiques une chance rare de comprendre comment les réseaux sociaux influencent le bien-être et la vie quotidienne des adolescents. Certains experts espèrent que l'interdiction réduira les problèmes d'addiction et d'exposition à des contenus nuisibles, tandis que d'autres craignent qu'elle ne prive les jeunes d'un soutien social important et d'opportunités d'engagement politique.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs continueront à recueillir des données dans les mois à venir pour voir si l'interdiction améliore la santé mentale ou crée de nouveaux défis. Ils étudieront aussi comment les familles et les écoles s'adaptent, et si les jeunes trouvent d'autres moyens de communiquer en ligne ou hors ligne.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – L'interdiction des réseaux sociaux aux moins de 16 ans en Australie ouvre une nouvelle voie pour comprendre l'influence des plateformes en ligne sur l'esprit, les amitiés et l'apprentissage des jeunes.\n",
