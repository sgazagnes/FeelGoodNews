      "title": "Scientists teach bacteria the octopus’s secret to camouflage",
      "summary": "Researchers at UC San Diego have figured out how to get bacteria to produce xanthommatin, the pigment that lets octopuses and squids camouflage. By linking the pigment’s production to bacterial survival, they created a self-sustaining system that boosts yields dramatically. This biotechnological leap could revolutionize materials science, cosmetics, and sustainable chemistry.",
      "content": "Scientists at the University of California, San Diego have come closer to understanding one of nature's most fascinating abilities: the art of disguise.\n\nOctopuses, squids, cuttlefish, and their cephalopod relatives are masters of camouflage, able to instantly shift their skin color to blend into their surroundings. This extraordinary transformation is driven by a natural pigment called xanthommatin, which plays a key role in their color-changing skin.\n\nFor years, researchers and even defense organizations have been captivated by xanthommatin's light-responsive qualities. Yet replicating and studying this pigment in the lab has been extremely challenging -- until now.\n\nIn a new breakthrough from UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, scientists successfully created a method to produce large quantities of xanthommatin. This marks a major step forward in decoding how animals achieve their remarkable camouflage.\n\nBacteria Turned Into Natural Pigment Factories\n\nUsing a biologically inspired approach, the research team was able to generate the pigment inside bacteria, achieving production levels up to 1,000 times greater than previous methods. This innovation could pave the way for sustainable new uses in materials and cosmetics, including applications in photoelectronics, thermal coatings, dyes, and UV-protective products.\n\n\"We've developed a new technique that has sped up our capabilities to make a material, in this case xanthommatin, in a bacterium for the first time,\" said Bradley Moore, senior author of the study and a marine chemist with appointments at Scripps Oceanography and the UC San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. \"This natural pigment is what gives an octopus or a squid its ability to camouflage -- a fantastic superpower -- and our achievement to advance production of this material is just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nPublished today (Nov. 3) in Nature Biotechnology, the study received support from the National Institutes of Health, the Office of Naval Research, the Swiss National Science Foundation, and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\nAccording to the researchers, this achievement not only deepens our understanding of the biological and chemical foundations of animal coloration, but also highlights a powerful new biotechnology. The same technique could be used to create other valuable compounds, helping industries transition away from petroleum-based products toward more sustainable, nature-inspired materials.\n\nA Promising Pigment\n\nBeyond cephalopods, xanthommatin is also found in insects within the arthropod group, contributing to the brilliant orange and yellow hues of monarch butterfly wings and the bright reds seen in dragonfly bodies and fly eyes.\n\nDespite xanthommatin's fantastic color properties, it is poorly understood due to a persistent supply challenge. Harvesting the pigment from animals isn't scalable or efficient, and traditional lab methods are labor intensive, reliant on chemical synthesis that is low yielding.\n\nResearchers in the Moore Lab at Scripps Oceanography sought to change that, working with colleagues across UC San Diego and at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability in Denmark to design a solution, a sort of growth feedback loop they call \"growth coupled biosynthesis.\"\n\nThe way in which they bioengineered the octopus pigment, a chemical, in a bacterium represents a novel departure from typical biotechnological approaches. Their approach intimately connected the production of the pigment with the survival of the bacterium that made it.\n\n\"We needed a whole new approach to address this problem,\" said Leah Bushin, lead author of the study, now a faculty member at Stanford University and formerly a postdoctoral researcher in the Moore Lab at Scripps Oceanography, where her work was conducted. \"Essentially, we came up with a way to trick the bacteria into making more of the material that we needed.\"\n\nTypically, when researchers try to get a microbe to produce a foreign compound, it creates a major metabolic burden. Without significant genetic manipulation, the microbe resists diverting its essential resources to produce something unfamiliar.\n\nBy linking the cell's survival to the production of their target compound, the team was able to trick the microbe into creating xanthommatin. To do this, they started with a genetically engineered \"sick\" cell, one that could only survive if it produced both the desired pigment, along with a second chemical called formic acid. For every molecule of pigment generated, the cell also produced one molecule of formic acid. The formic acid, in turn, provides fuel for the cell's growth, creating a self-sustaining loop that drives pigment production.\n\n\"We made it such that activity through this pathway, of making the compound of interest, is absolutely essential for life. If the organism doesn't make xanthommatin, it won't grow,\" said Bushin.\n\nTo push the bacteria to make even more pigment, the researchers turned to robotics and automation. They used robotic systems to guide the microbes through two rounds of high-throughput adaptive laboratory evolution, a process designed to help the cells gradually improve their performance. This advanced method was developed by the lab of study co-author Adam Feist, a professor in the Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering and a senior scientist at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability.\n\nThe researchers also used specialized bioinformatics software from the Feist Lab to pinpoint genetic changes that increased the microbes' productivity. These key mutations allowed the engineered bacteria to produce the pigment efficiently using only a single nutrient source.\n\n\"This project gives a glimpse into a future where biology enables the sustainable production of valuable compounds and materials through advanced automation, data integration and computationally driven design,\" said Feist. \"Here, we show how we can accelerate innovation in biomanufacturing by bringing together engineers, biologists and chemists using some of the most advanced strain-engineering techniques to develop and optimize a novel product in a relatively short time.\"\n\nTraditional approaches yield around five milligrams of pigment per liter \"if you're lucky,\" said Bushin, while the new method yields between one to three grams per liter.\n\nGetting from the planning stages to the actual experimentation in the lab took several years of dedicated work, but once the plan was put into motion, the results were almost immediate.\n\n\"It was one of my best days in the lab,\" Bushin recalled of the first successful experiment. \"I'd set up the experiment and left it overnight. When I came in the next morning and realized it worked and it was producing a lot of pigment, I was thrilled. Moments like that are why I do science.\"\n\nNext Steps\n\nMoore anticipates that this new biotech methodology, which is fully nature-inspired and non-invasive, will transform the way in which biochemicals are produced.\n\n\"We've really disrupted the way that people think about how you engineer a cell,\" he said. \"Our innovative technological approach sparked a huge leap in production capability. This new method solves a supply challenge and could now make this biomaterial much more broadly available.\"\n\nWhile some applications for this material are far-out, the authors noted active interest from the U.S. Department of Defense and cosmetics companies. According to the researchers, collaborators are interested in exploring the material's natural camouflage capabilities, while skincare companies are interested in using it in natural sunscreens. Other industries see potential uses ranging from color-changing household paints to environmental sensors.\n\n\"As we look to the future, humans will want to rethink how we make materials to support our synthetic lifestyle of 8 billion people on Earth,\" said Moore. \"Thanks to federal funding, we've unlocked a promising new pathway for designing nature-inspired materials that are better for people and the planet.\"\n\nAdditional study authors are Tobias Alter, María Alván-Vargas, Daniel Volke, Òscar Puiggené and Pablo Nikel from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability; Elina Olson from UC San Diego's Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering; Lara Dürr and Mariah Avila from Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego; and Taehwan Kim and Leila Deravi from Northeastern University.",

      "summary": "Physicists have uncovered how direct atom-atom interactions can amplify superradiance, the collective burst of light from atoms working in sync. By incorporating quantum entanglement into their models, they reveal that these interactions can enhance energy transfer efficiency, offering new design principles for quantum batteries, sensors, and communication systems.",
      "content": "Researchers from the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw, the Centre for New Technologies at the University of Warsaw, and Emory University (Atlanta, USA) have explored how atoms influence one another when interacting with light. Their study, published in Physical Review Letters, expands on existing models of this effect. By demonstrating that direct atom-to-atom interactions can enhance a powerful collective burst of light known as superradiance, the team opens new possibilities for developing advanced quantum technologies.\n\nIn light-matter systems, many emitters (e.g., atoms) share the same optical mode within a cavity. This mode represents a pattern of light confined between mirrors, enabling collective behaviors that isolated atoms cannot exhibit. A key example is superradiance, a quantum effect in which atoms emit light in perfect synchronization, creating a brightness far greater than the sum of their individual emissions.\n\nMost earlier studies of superradiance assumed that light-matter coupling dominates, modeling the entire atomic group as one large \"giant dipole\" connected to the cavity's electromagnetic field. \"Photons act as mediators that couple each emitter to all others inside the cavity,\" explains Dr. João Pedro Mendonça, the study's first author, who earned his PhD at the University of Warsaw and now conducts research at its Centre for New Technologies. In real materials, however, nearby atoms also interact through short-range dipole-dipole forces, which are often overlooked. The new study examines what happens when these intrinsic atom-atom interactions are considered. The findings show that such interactions can either compete with or reinforce the photon-mediated coupling responsible for superradiance. Understanding this balance is vital for interpreting experiments where light and matter strongly influence one another.\n\nThe Role of Entanglement in Light-Matter Interactions\n\nAt the heart of this behavior lies quantum entanglement, the deep connection between particles that share quantum states. Yet many common theoretical methods treat light and matter as separate entities, erasing this crucial link. \"Semiclassical models greatly simplify the quantum problem but at the cost of losing crucial information; they eﬀectively ignore possible entanglement between photons and atoms, and we found that in some cases this is not a good approximation,\" the authors note.\n\nTo address this, the team developed a computational method that keeps entanglement explicitly represented, allowing them to track correlations both within and between the atomic and photonic subsystems. Their results show that direct interactions between neighboring atoms can lower the threshold for superradiance and even reveal a previously unknown ordered phase that shares its key properties. Overall, the work demonstrates that including entanglement is essential for accurately describing the full range of light-matter behaviors.\n\nImplications for Quantum Technologies\n\nBeyond deepening fundamental understanding, this discovery has practical significance for future quantum technologies. Cavity-based light-matter systems are central to many emerging devices, including quantum batteries -- conceptual energy storage units that could charge and discharge much faster by exploiting collective quantum effects. Superradiance can speed up both processes, enhancing overall efficiency.\n\nThe new findings clarify how microscopic atomic interactions influence these processes. By adjusting the strength and nature of atom-atom interactions, scientists can tune the conditions needed for superradiance and control how energy moves through the system. \"Once you keep light-matter entanglement in the model, you can predict when a device will charge quickly and when it won't. That turns a many-body eﬀect into a practical design rule,\" said João Pedro Mendonça. Similar principles could also advance quantum communication networks and high-precision sensors.\n\nThe research grew from an international partnership that brought together expertise from several institutions. João Pedro Mendonça conducted multiple research stays in the United States, supported by the University of Warsaw's \"Excellence Initiative -- Research University\" (IDUB) program and the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA). The researchers emphasize that collaboration and mobility were key to their success. \"This is a great example of how international mobility and collaboration can open the door to breakthroughs,\" the team concludes.",

      "content": "Since the release of the chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022, there has been frantic debate at universities about artificial intelligence (AI). These conversations have centred on undergraduate teaching — how to prevent cheating and how to use AI to improve learning. But a quieter, deeper disruption is unfolding in research, the other core activity of universities.\n\nA doctoral education has long been seen as the pinnacle of academic training, an apprenticeship in original thinking, critical analysis and independent enquiry. However, that model is now under pressure. AI is not just another research tool; it is redefining what research is, how it is done and what counts as an original contribution.\n\nHow money, politics and technology are redefining the PhD experience\n\nUniversities are mostly unprepared for the scale of disruption, with few having comprehensive governance strategies. Many academics remain focused on the failings of early generative AI tools, such as hallucinations (confidently stated but false information), inconsistencies and superficial responses. But AI models that were clumsy in 2023 are becoming increasingly fluent and accurate.\n\nAI tools can already draft literature reviews, write sophisticated code with human guidance and even generate hypotheses when provided with data sets. ‘Agentic’ AI systems that can set their own sub-goals, coordinate tasks and learn from feedback represent another leap forwards. If the current trajectory continues, we’re fast approaching a moment when much of the conventional PhD workflow can be completed, or at least be heavily supported, by machines.\n\nUnanswered questions\n\nThis shift poses challenges for educators. What constitutes an original contribution becomes unclear when AI tools produce literature reviews, acquire and analyse data, and draft thesis chapters. Students might need to pivot from executing research tasks to framing questions and interrogating AI outputs.\n\nTo explore what the near future of research training might look like, I conducted a role play simulating a PhD student working with a hypothetical AI assistant. I used Claude, a leading AI system built by the firm Anthropic in San Francisco, California.\n\n‘Science saved my life’ — and it must save other at-risk scholars\n\nI fed the chatbot a detailed prompt (see Supplementary Information) describing a fictional AI research assistant called HALe — inspired by the AI character HAL 9000 from the science-fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey. I gave HALe capabilities that are already under development and are likely to improve in coming years. These include accessing external databases, integrating environmental and biological data, and performing advanced analyses autonomously. I then played the part of the student, asking questions and responding to the chatbot’s replies. The dialogue was generated in a single, unedited session — offering a fictional, yet plausible, glimpse of how future doctoral research could unfold.\n\nThe simulated goal was to complete a PhD project investigating how extreme ocean temperatures affect marine species — an ambitious task involving data synthesis, statistical modelling and writing a paper for publication. In this fictional scenario, HALe didn’t merely assist; it took initiative. It searched and extracted data from scientific literature, identified knowledge gaps, harmonized environmental and biological data sets, ran complex statistical analyses, interpreted the results, drafted a manuscript, suggested peer reviewers and even created an open-access data repository. The entire process, which would realistically take a student several months, played out in a short sequence of guided exchanges that might occupy just a few hours.\n\nWhat we stand to lose when foreign students are seen as a threat\n\nAlthough today’s AI models cannot yet perform these tasks with anything approaching full autonomy, the simulation was grounded in what current systems can already do with human guidance. For example, ChatGPT, Claude and other state-of the-art chatbots can draft credible literature reviews, propose hypotheses, suggest analytical approaches and generate code that — when reviewed and validated by a human — can process real data sets and produce meaningful outputs. They can even help to interpret statistical results and visualize findings. What struck me, while conducting this exercise, was how much of the conventional PhD process could now be driven and accelerated by AI. At times, it felt like working with a hyper-competent and astonishingly rapid research assistant. It was both exciting and unsettling.\n\nOf course, this simulation reflects a particular kind of project — analytical, data-rich and computational in nature. Experimental or field-based PhD programmes, especially those that require collecting samples, laboratory work or interacting with other people or with the natural world, will remain less susceptible to full automation. But even in these areas of science, AI is likely to play a growing part in experimental design, autonomous data collection, literature synthesis and post-experiment analysis.\n\nNew skills\n\nThis experience brought home how training in academic skills will need to be fundamentally reconsidered in an era of AI.",

Ce changement pourrait accélérer la recherche et ouvrir de nouvelles façons d’apprendre et de découvrir.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – Les outils d’IA transforment la recherche doctorale en accélérant les tâches et en modifiant les méthodes d’apprentissage, poussant les universités à moderniser leur formation.\n",
      "personality_title_es": "La IA está cambiando cómo aprenden y trabajan los estudiantes de doctorado",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Desde el lanzamiento de ChatGPT a finales de 2022, las universidades han debatido sobre cómo la inteligencia artificial (IA) afecta la enseñanza y la investigación. Mientras la atención se centraba en evitar trampas en las clases de pregrado, la IA está cambiando silenciosamente cómo se realiza la investigación, especialmente para los estudiantes de doctorado.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Un investigador probó un nuevo sistema de IA llamado HALe, inspirado en un personaje de ciencia ficción, para ver cómo podía ayudar en un proyecto de doctorado. Esta IA podía buscar artículos científicos, analizar datos, encontrar vacíos en el conocimiento, hacer estadísticas e incluso redactar partes de un artículo. Tareas que normalmente toman meses se hicieron en pocas horas con la ayuda de la IA.\n\n**Impacto** – Esto muestra que la IA puede acelerar y mejorar el trabajo de investigación, ayudando a los estudiantes de doctorado a enfocarse más en hacer buenas preguntas y revisar los resultados de la IA. Cambia lo que significa hacer una investigación original porque la IA puede realizar muchas etapas por sí sola. Aunque no toda la investigación puede automatizarse, la IA será una herramienta útil en muchas áreas.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Las universidades tendrán que replantear cómo forman a los estudiantes de doctorado. En lugar de enseñar solo habilidades tradicionales de investigación, también deberán enseñar a trabajar con IA, entender sus límites y usarla de forma responsable. Este cambio podría hacer la investigación más rápida y abrir nuevas formas de aprender y descubrir.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Las herramientas de IA están transformando la investigación doctoral al acelerar tareas y cambiar cómo aprenden los estudiantes, impulsando a las universidades a actualizar sus métodos de formación.\n",
