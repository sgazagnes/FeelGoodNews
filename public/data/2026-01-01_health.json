As the new year begins, FRANCE 24 takes a final look back at the stories that lifted spirits in recent months. From scientific breakthroughs to signs of hope for the planet, there was enough to end 2025 on a high note.\n\nThe Sun as never seen before\n\nScientists had awaited the moment since the 1950s. In July, NASA released the closest images ever taken of the Sun, captured by the Parker Solar Probe.\n\nThis image provided by NASA on July 15, 2025 shows solar wind escaping from the surface of the star. © NASA handout, AFP\n\nIn the black-and-white images, untrained eyes may see wisps resembling smoke. Experts, however, identify overlapping plasma eruptions and solar wind captured in unprecedented detail, providing valuable data to better understand space weather and the workings of the star.\n\nRead more🌟The Bright Side: Solar-skimming probe reveals new insights into space weather threats\n\nMajor medical breakthroughs\n\nThe generic version of injectable lenacapavir will be available at a price of $40 per year in 120 low and middle-income countries starting in 2027. © AFP\n\nThere was also cause for optimism in the medical field. In January, a team of US researchers made a major breakthrough on multiple sclerosis, demonstrating a link between the autoimmune disease – which affects more than 2.8 million people worldwide – and the Epstein-Barr virus.\n\nThe discovery raised hope that vaccination against the virus could one day eliminate one of the disease’s triggers.\n\nRead more🌟The Bright Side: Groundbreaking research on multiple sclerosis wins 'Oscars of science'\n\nAnother positive development concerned HIV prevention. Generic versions of injectable lenacapavir, a preventive treatment against the virus that causes AIDS, are expected to become available at a lower cost in around 100 countries from 2027.\n\nThe development is expected to greatly expand access to a treatment considered far more practical than a daily pill, particularly in low-income countries.\n\nFewer smokers in France\n\nThis photograph shows a no smoking sign in a shopping mall in Paris on June 3, 2025. © Joël Saget, AFP\n\n\"Tobacco is taboo, we’ll beat it\", said a French slogan that might just become reality. Last year, the number of smokers in the country declined, especially among young people, according to the French public health agency Santé publique France.\n\nSpecialists attributed the trend to anti-smoking policies implemented since 2014.\n\nRead moreHow French attitudes to cigarettes are changing\n\nIn 2025, the campaign intensified further, with smoking banned on beaches, in parks and in public gardens. The government’s stated aim is to achieve a tobacco-free generation by 2032.\n\nCountries move to better protect the oceans\n\nThis file photo shows a wandering cratena, or nudibranch, in the protected area of France's Porquerolles National Park. © Annika Hammerschlag, AP\n\nIt was a strong year for marine life. In June, world leaders met to reinforce the protection of the oceans.\n\nMeasures discussed included safeguarding the high seas, strengthening efforts against illegal fishing and expanding marine protected areas.\n\nOne commitment has already been fulfilled. After decades of negotiations, states (finally) ratified a treaty on protecting the high seas, providing tools to preserve ocean areas beyond national jurisdiction.\n\nRead moreProtecting the ocean: What is the high seas treaty?\n\nLynx and turtles rebound\n\nAn Iberian lynx is photographed at the Iberian Lynx Observatory of \"El Acebuche\" at the Donana Natural Park in Huelva, on June 30, 2021. © Cristina Quicler, AFP\n\nThe Iberian lynx, recognisable by its pointed ears and spotted coat, recorded a significant recovery. After narrowly avoiding extinction, the species was removed this year from the \"endangered\" category on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nRead moreBouncing back: Spain's Iberian lynx saved from extinction\n\nThis year, there were 2,021 Iberian lynxes worldwide, a significant jump from just 94 recorded in 2001.\n\nThe green sea turtle also showed signs of recovery. Long hunted for its eggs and shell, it is no longer classified as endangered, highlighting the effectiveness of conservation measures when properly enforced.\n\nEuropean Parliament backs abortion rights\n\nA banner reads \"abortion is a human right\" ahead of a demonstration marking the International Women's Day in Brussels on March 8, 2025. © Simon Wohlfahrt, AFP\n\nReproductive rights in Europe also advanced in 2025. On December 17, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging EU institutions to facilitate access to safe abortions across the bloc.\n\nThe move followed a petition signed by more than one million EU citizens. It called for a mechanism enabling people living in countries without access to safe and legal abortion to travel at reduced cost to another EU member state where the procedure is permitted.\n\nThe European Commission said it would review the petition before March 2026.\n\nSwimming returns to the Seine\n\nPeople swim in the River Seine in Paris on July 5 2025, in the first public bathing session in the capital's historic waterway since 1923. © Abdul Saboor, Reuters\n\nAfter a century and the Paris Olympic Games, a long-held ambition became reality.

      "content": "A wave paralysed me but AI could help me walk again\n\n23 hours ago Share Save Meleri Williams BBC Wales Share Save\n\nAfter a New Year's Eve swim in 2023, Dan Richards' life changed forever\n\nWhen Dan Richards went for a New Year's Eve swim in 2023, he never could have imagined how drastically his life would change. In a freak accident, he injured his neck when a wave caused him to flip and hit the sand in Langland Bay, Swansea. \"I knew instantly that I was paralysed,\" the 37-year-old said. \"I couldn't move anything.\" Doctors told him he would be bed-bound but, two years later, he uses a wheelchair and can move his arms and fingers. He has even walked with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in Wales and Germany.\n\nDan and his partner Anna, 40, were celebrating the new year with a cold water dip when the accident happened. \"I remember all of it, unfortunately. Being pulled out. And then everything changing,\" Dan said. \"I got hit by a wave, it flipped me over and folded me backwards, and snapped my neck. I knew it was bad.\"\n\nAnna Thomas Dan is determined to move as much as possible after becoming paralysed\n\nAnna recalled hearing Dan shouting for help as she got ready to get into the water. \"I just remember looking over and just seeing Dan's head coming up and then going back under,\" she said. \"We dragged him out. But he was just dead weight and the sea was coming in really fast. \"We waited for emergency services, and then [I remember] begging them to let me go in the helicopter. It was horrendous.\" After being taken to hospital in Bristol, the couple from Swansea were given life-changing news.\n\nAnna Thomas Dan and Anna loved to swim in the sea before the accident\n\nDan said he was told he was paralysed form the neck down, would not be able to move and it was \"highly likely\" he would be bed-bound for the rest of his life. Anna - who had only started dating Dan a few months before the accident - had to make dreaded phone calls to family members. \"It was New Year's Eve, I was put in a room on my own but you could hear people laughing and joking, and I had to tell Dan's parents. \"How do you phone someone's mum and say that their son is paralysed?\"\n\nDan was given life-changing news while in hospital in January 2024\n\nAnna said every day since the accident has brought a new challenge. \"It's our reality. Until you're in this situation... you don't realise just how much you have lost.\" But in the months that followed the accident, when Dan was in hospital, even the slightest movement in his toes gave the couple hope things would change.\n\nDan and Anna have returned to Wales from Germany to celebrate Christmas\n\n\"Luckily I'm quite stubborn,\" Dan said. \"I just wanted to see the physios as soon as possible. I wanted to work. I didn't accept what they were saying. \"I'm proud of the progress I've made. It's a long time since laying in bed in Bristol, that's for sure.\" He continued: \"The feeling in my toes then translated into full feeling through my legs and feet, some movement in my right leg [and] core strength - which I was told was gone - started to come back. Movement in my arms, my fingers, being able to hold things. \"I'm still hopeful, I'm still positive. With modern technologies, I'm not giving up.\" Dan had private physiotherapy at a specialist clinic in south Wales which used a world-first combined treatment to help him walk with a machine.\n\nAnna Thomas Family and friends have fundraised for Dan's private physiotherapy treatments\n\nJakko Brouwers, a neurophysiotherapist from Morello clinic in Newport, said Dan was \"an immensely motivated guy\" when he visited them after being discharged from hospital. \"The technology is two-fold,\" he explained. \"The first part we tried with Dan is a robot. The robot will mimic normal human gait as much as possible. \"The other part of the system that we developed is a stimulation suit that has got sensors. The trousers are also fitted with electrodes and we can stimulate muscle activity at the right time. \"Through a little bit of algorithm - and dare I say AI - it will start developing a walking pattern. \"It's super exciting. It's not often that you see that in Wales.\"\n\nThis robot helped Dan to walk at Morello clinic in Newport shortly after he was discharged from hospital\n\nDan said the experience was \"surreal\" but \"the best feeling\". \"It just made me want to push harder. That's on our doorstep here in Wales, so it spurred us on to do some research, and do other things.\" But private physiotherapy and innovative treatment does not come without cost. From raffles to ultramarathons and charity nights, family and friends have fundraised meaning Dan and Anna could set off for a trial abroad in October.\n\nAnna Thomas Dan and Anna spent two months in Bochum, Germany, for treatment\n\nDan explained he was trying two different treatments simultaneously in Germany - a stem cell treatment straight into his spinal cord, alongside using a Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) suit, which is a machine that works on brain waves. \"It's one of the first times it's ever been done,\" he said. \"Sensors translate signals into movement, which then get my legs working, get me walking. \"The more you do it, the stronger the signals get, the faster it gets and eventually you're able to walk without the suit.\"",

      "title": "A missing protein may be aging your immune system",
      "summary": "As we age, our immune system quietly loses its edge, and scientists have uncovered a surprising reason why. A protein called platelet factor 4 naturally declines over time, allowing blood stem cells to multiply too freely and drift toward unhealthy, mutation-prone behavior linked to cancer, inflammation, and heart disease. Researchers found that restoring this protein in older mice — and even in human stem cells in the lab — made aging blood and immune cells behave strikingly younger again.",
      "content": "As people grow older, visible changes like gray hair and weaker muscles are only part of the story. Aging also affects the immune system. One major reason is that the stem cells responsible for producing blood and immune cells can accumulate genetic mutations over time, increasing the risk of cancer and other health problems.\n\nScientists at the University of Illinois Chicago have identified a key biological process behind this shift. Writing in the journal Blood, the researchers report that aging is linked to declining levels of a protein called platelet factor 4. Even more striking, restoring this protein in older blood cells reversed several signs of cellular aging. The findings suggest a potential new target for treating age-related disorders of the blood and immune system.\n\nThe Role of Blood Stem Cells in Immune Health\n\nHematopoietic stem cells, often called blood stem cells, reside in the bone marrow and serve as the foundation of the body's blood and immune systems. These rare cells generate all major types of blood and immune cells needed for oxygen transport and protection against infection.\n\n\"Our hematopoietic stem cells are very rare,\" said UIC's Sandra Pinho, associate professor of pharmacology and regenerative medicine in the College of Medicine. \"We call them the Holy Grail of the immune system.\"\n\nIn younger individuals, these stem cells maintain a healthy balance. They produce myeloid cells, which include red blood cells and some immune cells, as well as lymphoid cells, such as T and B cells that play a central role in fighting infections.\n\nWhy Aging Stem Cells Lose Balance\n\nAs the body ages, blood stem cells begin to favor the production of myeloid cells while generating fewer lymphoid cells. This shift alters immune function and weakens the body's ability to respond to disease.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons why, normally, older individuals are not used as donors for bone marrow transplantation, because their stem cells are not as potent,\" Pinho said.\n\nThis imbalance not only affects immunity but also increases vulnerability to age-related diseases.\n\nPlatelet Factor 4 and Stem Cell Control\n\nThrough studies in mice and human bone marrow samples, the researchers found that platelet factor 4 plays a central role in regulating blood stem cell behavior. In younger people and animals, the protein acts as a signaling molecule that limits how often stem cells divide. This control is especially important for stem cells that produce myeloid cells.\n\nWith age, immune cells produce less platelet factor 4. As a result, stem cells divide more frequently and without proper regulation.\n\n\"When stem cells start to divide more often than they should, and if their proliferation is not regulated, they can accumulate mutations over time,\" said Pinho.\n\nIn humans, these mutations are linked to chronic inflammation, a higher risk of blood cancers, and even cardiovascular disease.\n\nReversing Signs of Immune Aging in the Lab\n\nThe team discovered that restoring platelet factor 4 could counteract these age-related changes. Older mice received daily blood infusions of the protein for more than a month. After treatment, their blood and immune cells showed behavior and characteristics more typical of much younger animals.\n\nSimilar effects were observed in laboratory experiments using human stem cells. When platelet factor 4 was added to aged human cells, the researchers saw a clear improvement in stem cell function.\n\n\"It rejuvenated the aging of the blood system,\" Pinho said.\n\nWhat This Means for Aging and Disease\n\nWhile the results are promising, platelet factor 4 alone is not expected to reverse aging throughout the entire body or significantly extend human lifespan.\n\nThough the effect was strong, platelet factor 4 won't be a silver bullet that reverses the aging of all tissues and prolongs the lifespan of elderly human patients alone, Pinho said. However, it could become part of broader strategies aimed at improving age-related conditions.\n\n\"It's clear evidence that it's possible to reverse, intrinsically, certain age-associated disorders,\" Pinho said.\n\nSen Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow in the Pinho lab, is the study's first author.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – As people grow older, their immune system becomes weaker partly because the stem cells that create blood and immune cells start to behave abnormally. This can lead to diseases like cancer and heart problems.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago discovered that a protein called platelet factor 4 decreases with age, causing blood stem cells to multiply too much and become less healthy. When scientists gave this protein back to older mice and human stem cells in the lab, the cells started acting younger and healthier.\n\n**Impact** – This finding is important because it shows a specific reason why the immune system ages and points to a way to fix it. By restoring platelet factor 4, it might be possible to improve the health of blood and immune cells in older people, which could help reduce risks of diseases linked to aging.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists need to study how this protein can be safely used in humans and whether it can help treat age-related diseases. It could become part of new treatments that improve immune health as people get older.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Restoring the protein platelet factor 4 helps blood stem cells behave younger, offering a new way to improve immune health during aging.",

      "content": "Hidden Guests: Migrating Cells and How the New Science of Microchimerism is Redefining Human Identity Lise Barnéoud, transl. Bronwyn Haslam Greystone Books (2025)\n\nThe chimaera of Greek mythology was “an evil creature with a lion’s head, a goat’s body, and a serpent’s tail”, notes journalist Lise Barnéoud in Hidden Guests. Humans are also chimaeras — thanks to the presence of cells that are not our own inside our bodies.\n\nCould baby’s first bacteria take root before birth?\n\nMothers carry cells that came from their biological children, passed across the placenta when the baby was in the womb. Likewise, children carry cells that were transferred to them in utero from their mothers — some of which might even be from the child’s maternal grandmothers, older siblings or twin.\n\nThese ‘microchimeric’ cells have been found in every organ that has been studied so far. But they are also rare — much rarer, for example, than the trillions of microorganisms that reside in our guts, on our skin and in many other organs. We carry only one microchimeric cell for every 10,000 to 1 million of our own cells.\n\nIn Hidden Guests, the author invites readers to learn about the pioneering “microchimerists” — scientists who discovered these fascinating shared cells. She also challenges us to consider the broader implications for health and science, and the philosophy of the fact that we are all chimaeras.\n\nUnplanned discovery\n\nMicrochimeric cells were, we learn, discovered through a series of accidental observations. In the late 1800s, pathologist Georg Schmorl described ‘giant cells’ in the lungs of people who had died from eclampsia — a life-threatening inflammatory condition that can occur during pregnancy. These giant cells resembled the cells of the placenta, leading Schmorl to suggest that fetal cells passing into the bloodstream of mothers was the norm, rather than the exception.\n\nThe probiotic home: where microbes are welcome guests\n\nThen, in 1969, a team studying immunity in pregnant people detected white blood cells that contained the Y chromosome in the blood of individuals who would eventually give birth to boys1. For more than two decades, it was presumed that these microchimeric cells were a temporary feature of pregnancy. It wasn’t until 1993 that geneticist Diana Bianchi found cells with Y chromosomes in women who had given birth to sons between one and 27 years earlier2.\n\nThis finding overturned the dogma that children inherit genes from their parents and never the other way around — these transferred fetal cells move through the family tree, travelling ‘backwards in time’ from children to their mothers. Bianchi and others would go on to show that these cells have remarkable regenerative properties — promoting wound healing in mothers by transforming into blood vessels or skin cells.\n\nImmunological implications\n\nMicrochimerism also calls into question a central tenet of immunology: that the immune system works by classifying cells in a binary fashion, as ‘self’ or ‘non-self’. Under this simplistic model, microchimeric cells should trigger an immune response and be rejected by the body — but they do not. Barnéoud challenges readers to consider whether forcing microchimerism-related discrepancies to fit into existing immunological rules is appropriate, instead of allowing these cells to influence new immunological rules.\n\nAt around the same time that Bianchi was making her groundbreaking discovery, rheumatologist Lee Nelson also found Y-chromosome-containing cells in people who had previously given birth to sons3. Nelson was studying autoimmune diseases, which disproportionately affect middle-aged women, and at the time were thought to be caused by hormone imbalances.",
