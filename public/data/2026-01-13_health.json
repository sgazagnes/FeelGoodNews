      "summary": "Researchers have discovered a brain activity pattern that can predict which people with mild cognitive impairment are likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Using a noninvasive brain scanning technique and a custom analysis tool, they detected subtle changes in electrical signals tied to memory processing years before diagnosis. The findings point to a new way of spotting Alzheimer’s early—by listening directly to how neurons behave.",
      "content": "Using a specially designed analysis tool, scientists at Brown University have identified a brain-based biomarker that may help predict whether mild cognitive impairment will progress into Alzheimer's disease. The approach focuses on measuring electrical activity produced by neurons, offering a new way to spot early signs of the disease directly in the brain.\n\n\"We've detected a pattern in electrical signals of brain activity that predicts which patients are most likely to develop the disease within two and a half years,\" said Stephanie Jones, a professor of neuroscience affiliated with Brown's Carney Institute for Brain Science who co-led the research. \"Being able to noninvasively observe a new early marker of Alzheimer's disease progression in the brain for the first time is a very exciting step.\"\n\nThe results were published in the journal Imaging Neuroscience.\n\nTracking Brain Activity in People With Mild Cognitive Impairment\n\nIn collaboration with researchers at the Complutense University of Madrid in Spain, the team studied brain activity recordings from 85 people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. The researchers followed these participants for several years to see how their conditions changed over time.\n\nBrain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography, or MEG -- a noninvasive method that captures electrical signals from the brain. During the recordings, participants were resting quietly with their eyes closed.\n\nA New Way to See Neuronal Signals\n\nTraditional approaches to analyzing MEG data often rely on averaging signals, which can blur important details about how individual neurons behave. To overcome this limitation, Jones and her colleagues at Brown developed a computational method known as the Spectral Events Toolbox.\n\nThis tool breaks brain activity down into distinct events, revealing when signals occur, how frequently they appear, how long they last, and how strong they are. The Spectral Events Toolbox has gained wide adoption and has been cited in more than 300 academic studies.\n\nMemory-Related Brain Signals Reveal Key Differences\n\nUsing this tool, the researchers focused on brain activity in the beta frequency band, which has been linked to memory processes and is especially relevant in Alzheimer's research, according to Jones. They compared beta activity patterns in people with mild cognitive impairment who later developed Alzheimer's disease with those who did not.\n\nClear differences emerged. Participants who went on to develop Alzheimer's within two and a half years showed noticeable changes in their beta activity compared with those whose condition remained stable.\n\n\"Two and a half years prior to their Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, patients were producing beta events at a lower rate, shorter in duration and at a weaker power,\" said Danylyna Shpakivska, the Madrid-based first author of the study. \"To our knowledge, this is the first time scientists have looked at beta events in relation to Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nWhy Brain-Based Biomarkers Matter\n\nCurrent biomarkers found in spinal fluid or blood can detect beta amyloid plaques and tau tangles, proteins that accumulate in the brain and are believed to drive Alzheimer's symptoms. However, these markers do not directly show how brain cells respond to this damage.\n\nA biomarker based on brain activity itself offers a more direct look at how neurons are functioning under this stress, said David Zhou, a postdoctoral researcher in Jones' lab at Brown who will lead the next stage of the research.\n\nToward Earlier Diagnosis and Better Treatments\n\nJones believes the Spectral Events Toolbox could eventually help clinicians identify Alzheimer's disease earlier, before significant cognitive decline occurs.\n\n\"The signal we've discovered can aid early detection,\" Jones said. \"Once our finding is replicated, clinicians could use our toolkit for early diagnosis and also to check whether their interventions are working.\"\n\nThe team is now moving into a new phase of the project, supported by a Zimmerman Innovation Award in Brain Science from the Carney Institute.\n\n\"Now that we've uncovered beta event features that predict Alzheimer's disease progression, our next step is to study the mechanisms of generation using computational neural modeling tools,\" Jones said. \"If we can recreate what's going wrong in the brain to generate that signal, then we can work with our collaborators to test therapeutics that might be able to correct the problem.\"\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, including the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, along with support from funding agencies in Spain.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Alzheimer’s disease is a condition that causes memory loss and other mental problems. It often starts slowly, and doctors find it hard to tell who will develop it early on. People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have some memory issues but don’t yet have full Alzheimer’s.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists at Brown University found a special pattern in brain activity that can predict if someone with MCI will get Alzheimer’s within about two and a half years. They used a safe brain scan called magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure electrical signals from the brain while people rested quietly. Then, they used a new computer tool called the Spectral Events Toolbox to study the brain signals in detail.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it shows a new way to spot Alzheimer’s early by looking directly at how brain cells behave. Unlike current tests that check for harmful proteins in the body, this method listens to brain activity linked to memory. For example, people who later got Alzheimer’s had weaker and shorter bursts of a specific brain signal called beta waves.\n\n**What's next step** – The research team will now try to understand how these brain signals are created and why they change. They plan to use computer models to simulate the brain and test possible treatments that might fix the problem.

      "title": "I spent months investigating whether gut health affects ageing - and if I could hack my own gut to age better",
      "summary": "Health editor Hugh Pym revamped his diet after a test suggested his gut health appeared to look five years older than he was",
      "content": "I spent months investigating whether gut health affects ageing - and if I could hack my own gut to age better\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Hugh Pym Health editor Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nGuts have become a source of immense fascination. Social media influencers promote unproven supplements said to boost gut health, whilst milk and kombucha brands promise to nourish them with \"good bacteria\". Some have dismissed the gut-obsession as a passing fad - however many doctors think that our gut microbiome might affect a whole spectrum of things, from mental health to the likelihood of getting certain cancers. But there's another medical possibility that I'm particularly interested in: how our gut impacts how well (or badly) we age. Which is why, a few months ago, I found myself at St Mary's Hospital in London, famous for the discovery of penicillin, preparing to receive a nerve-wracking insight into my own gut health. I was there to meet Dr James Kinross. He's a professor in surgery at Imperial College London and a practising colorectal surgeon - but perhaps the most colourful part of his job is that he analyses people's poo.\n\nNow that I'm in my 60s and recently became a grandparent, it seems a good time to find out what my own gut tells me about how I will fare in coming decades, says Hugh Pym (pictured with green juice as part of his food plan recommended by a dietician)\n\nWeeks earlier, I'd sent my own stool sample to a laboratory. Tests like these can provide insights into our gut microbiome - the trillions of microbes that live inside our stomach (including mostly bacteria, but also viruses and funghi). \"I'm a microbiome evangelist,\" he says. \"[It's] is so deeply ingrained in all aspects of our health.\" He believes the gut may play a crucial role in the ageing process - with consequences for how long we live, and how physically strong we remain in our elderly years. Some experts think that the importance of the gut microbiome in the ageing process has been overhyped, and everyone I speak to thinks that more research is needed. Now that I am in my 60s and recently became a grandparent, it seems a good time to find out what my own gut tells me about how I will fare in coming decades. And the answer to the bigger question: if gut health really can affect ageing, what, if anything, can we do to improve it?\n\nThe 117-year-old woman and her daily yoghurt\n\nMaria Branyas Morera was the world's oldest person. After she died in 2024 in northern Spain, aged 117, scientists took samples from her stool, blood, saliva, and urine and compared them with 75 other women from the Iberian peninsula. They said that she enjoyed a broadly healthy lifestyle: she lived in the countryside, walked one hour a day, and ate an oil-rich Mediterranean diet. But what really set her apart was the fact that each day she ate three servings of yoghurt. Dr Manel Esteller, a geneticist at the University of Barcelona who co-wrote the study, thinks that Morera's yoghurt habit may have given her a high level of helpful bacteria that can reduce inflammation. \"She had cells that seemed younger than her age,\" Esteller says. There have been other studies of centenarians - the superheroes of the longevity world.\n\nShutterstock Centenarians - like Tomiko Itooka, pictured in Japan on her 116th birthday - are often used as case studies by scientists studying longevity\n\nAgain and again, scientists have looked inside the guts of this blessed population of over-100s and found an impressive array of bacteria. In another study, published in 2022 in a journal, Nature, researchers in Jiaoling County, southeastern China, took stool samples from 18 centenarians - and found a high diversity of bacteria when compared to younger adults.\n\nGuts should be 'diverse like a garden'\n\nThis makes sense to Dr Mary Ni Lochlainn, a clinical lecturer in geriatric medicine at King's College London. She says it's helpful to think of our gut microbiome like a garden: we want it to be as diverse as possible. \"If you go into a garden where there's no plants and it just looks barren, that's a low-diversity garden,\" she explains. \"What you want is lots of flowers, colour, seeds.\" The trouble is, as we get older the diversity of our microbiome drops significantly. Some of the helpful bacteria disappear from our guts. But elderly people who buck this trend - and who hold on to their good bacteria well through their eighties and nineties - have been shown to live longer, healthier lives. For Ni Lochlainn, those studies are proof of a link between our gut and ageing. \"We know that centenarians… have more diverse microbiome.\"\n\nGetty Images Our national interest in gut health started in earnest in the early 2000s, when new technology allowed scientists to study our internal microbes in better detail. In recent years, scientists have become particularly curious about the role in ageing that gut bacteria plays\n\n\"There's something about those people who are kind of superior beings, in a way. They've managed to keep their diversity.\" And it's not just about how long someone lives - it's also about how well they live during their later years. Kinross says there is a link between gut bacteria and frailty, or an elderly person's ability to bounce back from an illness or injury.\n\nMy real age vs my gut's age\n\nBack in the lab at St Mary's Hospital, Kinross announces his verdict: I have good \"gut diversity in the microbiome\". It is \"broadly healthy\" which is good news. But from his tone I detect some caveats. Duly they come. First, he explains there are a couple of \"players in the gut\" which might increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Rather alarmingly, some nasty bugs are found too. E.coli and C-Difficile are present, which is not unusual. (Antibiotic use or a previous bout of gastroenteritis might have caused that.) But then we get to the age question. Kinross tells me that my gut biome is roughly equivalent to an Italian man five years older than me. He's worked this out by comparing my results to a study of 62 people in northern Italy. In that study - the only one of its kind - researchers analysed stool samples from people of different ages, ranging from 22 to 109, allowing them to paint a profile for what a person's gut looks like at different stages of life.\n\nUniversal Image Group / Getty A scientist compared Hugh Pym's gut results to those of people living in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy, parts of which are known for their fresh air\n\nThe verdict makes me reflect, with a pang of guilt, about those years of ready meals and snacking. Intense work schedules covering the 2008 banking crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in too many cakes and treats grabbed on the hoof. Living in London on and off since my mid-20s meant living with traffic fumes, rather than the fresher air of northern Italy. No wonder my gut is deemed five years older than I am. Kinross must have seen the colour draining from my panicked face because immediately he reassures me that the Italian men may have all been on Mediterranean diets, or living in rural areas unspoiled by urban pollution. Plus, it was a small sample size. He reassures me further by saying \"all the machinery for healthy ageing\" is there and just needs to be optimised. In other words, if I get to grips with my diet, there is time for improvement.\n\nCan you hack your gut health?\n\nAs to whether people really can improve their ageing process via their diet, Esteller is optimistic. He stresses some \"uncertainty\" remains about the link between gut health and ageing, but says the evidence is now fairly clear that what we put on our plate can affect both our \"morbidity and our mortality\". In other words, how long we live, and how likely we are to remain in strong health during our senior years. \"Even in the same city, [among] people with high income, people who eat better live longer,\" he says. He recommends eating olive oil, which contains bacteria-boosting polyphenols; and bluefish meat, a sharp-toothed marine food that contains fatty acids and is popular in Japan, which enjoys one of the highest life expectancies in the world (84.5), according to the World Health Organisation. Bluefish is hard to come by in most UK supermarkets, though; it tends to be found only in specialised fishmongers or restaurants.\n\nGetty Images Bluefish is a popular food in Japan but is harder to find in the UK\n\nHe also recommends avoiding refined white sugars and ultra-processed foods where possible, which can damage the diversity of bacteria in our gut. But Esteller points out that some people will have better luck than others trying to \"hack\" their gut - and genes play a part. Kinross cautions that research on how the microbiome works in different population groups is in its infancy. For now, he says, each patient should be assessed individually.\n\nThe 'tipping point' for older people\n\nArmed with the report, I arrange an appointment with Raquel Britzke, a dietician, who reviews the findings and writes a menu plan designed to boost the diversity of my gut bacteria in hope that it will help me to age better. Her plan is tailored to my own results. For the first few days of the week she suggests I make a breakfast bowl of flax seeds, chia seeds, kefir, blueberries, kiwi or pomegranate. (This isn't a million miles from my normal bowl of low-sugar granola and yoghurt.) For lunch, she recommends I have green salad, beans or lentils, broccoli, asparagus or beetroot, and grilled chicken without skin. This feels a bit trickier - the ingredients aren't always easy to find when grabbing a quick bite between news assignments. And for the evening meal, it's salmon, asparagus and brown rice. With a raised eyebrow my wife casts doubt on my ability to stick to that every evening.\n\nHugh's new diet includes juices made from kiwi, apple, kale, and mint leaves\n\nAs for drinks, I'm recommended juices. On day one, I diligently blend some mint, apple, kiwi, kale, lemon juice, sunflower seeds and water) to make a green juice. But the mint flavour ends up crowding out the others. Kefir and kombucha (bacteria-rich, fermented drinks) are also recommended and go down better. Both now have their place in my fridge. Raquel Britzke also recommends I take some capsules with probiotics like Omega-3 and Vitamin D3. They don't come cheap and it's hard to remember the specific times of the day when they should be taken (some but not all on an empty stomach).\n\nKinross tells me that nutritional change needs to be \"significant\" to make a difference to ageing. If I rigorously follow my new diet plan, he says, I could see a change to my gut biome \"within a few weeks\", he explains. But he warns that more \"modest\" changes to diets - for example, if you do it one day and not the next - then the biome won't see much benefit. And by extension, any improvement to ageing prospects are less likely too. I still have time, he tells me. But there does come a \"tipping point\" for older people when the gut biome gets worse.\n\nThe chicken-and-egg of gut health\n\nThere's another conundrum, though - one that Ni Lochlainn calls the \"chicken or the egg\" problem. That is: does a more diverse gut make us stronger in old age, or does the fact we're stronger in old age mean we have a more diverse gut? Historically it's been difficult to know which is causing the other. But even that question may have now been answered, thanks in part to faecal transplant research - where faeces are taken from a human or animal and given to an animal (usually a mouse) via a capsule or a tube into their stomach. In one such study, published in 2020, scientists in the US looked at two groups of 11, healthy mice. The first group received faeces from old mice; the second group got them from young mice. Within three months, the mice that received old faeces started to exhibit depressive-like behaviour. Their short-term memory deteriorated, as did their spatial awareness. In effect, their bodies became older. Ni Lochlainn accepts that to many people this sounds unpleasant - but these studies are important because they suggest a direct line of causation: from a gut microbiome to the age of a body.\n\nGetty Images Hugh Pym: 'I found myself at St Mary's Hospital in London preparing to receive a nerve-wracking insight into my gut health'\n\nNot everyone is as excited about the power of our gut to control ageing. Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, says research into the gut microbiome is \"exciting\" and \"has certainly piqued the public's interest\" - but, she adds \"it's important to remember, especially as research in the area is still emerging, that 'gut health' is likely just one piece of a much bigger picture. \"Good health is not determined by any single factor.\" Ultimately, scientists say it is possible to improve ageing process via your diet - though they caution that food is not everything. Esteller estimates that diet probably determines about one-third of your ageing outcome. The rest is a mix of genetics and other lifestyle factors, such as exercise and avoiding smoking cigarettes. As for my own gut health, it's still early days on my new diet. My appetite is sated and I am not tempted by snacks, other than the recommended apples, grapes and nuts. But in a busy lifestyle with unpredictable hours, sticking to this sort of meticulous plan will be challenging - and I'm doubtful of my ability to pull it off. Still, the tests and journey has been a wake-up call on my own gut - and my future health. Additional reporting: Luke Mintz Top image credit: Getty Images",

According to a new survey from the American Heart Association, many people have not heard of CKM syndrome, yet most say they want to better understand it.\n\nNearly 90% of U.S. adults have at least one risk factor linked to CKM syndrome.[1] These risk factors include high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, high blood glucose (sugar), excess weight and reduced kidney function.

It is reassuring that once the CKM connection was defined nearly three-quarters of those responding understood that it was important and wanted to learn more,\" said Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., FAHA, the American Heart Association's chief medical officer for prevention.\n\nHow the Heart Kidneys and Metabolism Are Connected\n\nCKM health refers to the combined function of the heart, kidneys and metabolic system (responsible for creating, using and storing energy, which affects weight and blood glucose level). These systems rely on one another to work properly. If one begins to struggle, it can place added strain on the others. Over time, this interaction can create a harmful cycle that significantly increases the risk of developing CKM syndrome. The American Heart Association plans to release the first-ever clinical guidelines focused on CKM syndrome in early 2026.\n\nWhat the Survey Revealed About Public Awareness\n\nThe new survey highlights major gaps in understanding about CKM health:\n\nOnly 12% of U.S. adults said they had heard of CKM health or CKM syndrome\n\n79% agreed it is important to learn more about CKM health, and 72% said they want additional information\n\nMost respondents were interested in how CKM syndrome is treated (72%) and diagnosed (71%)\n\n68% incorrectly believed health conditions should be managed one at a time or were unsure of the best approach\n\n42% thought a healthy heart would not likely be affected by other organ systems or were uncertain\n\n\"The heart, kidney and metabolic systems are connected and, as such, should be treated in a coordinated way,\" Sanchez said. \"These results reveal the need to emphasize those connections and help patients understand the importance of collaborative care.\"\n\nHelping People Take Action Earlier\n\nThrough its CKM Health Initiative, the American Heart Association is offering educational tools and an online resource hub to explain how heart, kidney and metabolic health are linked. These resources aim to help people take early steps to lower their risk of heart attack, heart failure or stroke. The Association is also working with healthcare teams nationwide to strengthen collaboration among professionals caring for patients with multiple chronic conditions.\n\nA Simple Way to Understand CKM Health\n\nA new educational video explains \"2 truths\" about heart health using clear visuals and plain language (watch the video here):\n\nThe heart pumps blood to the body The metabolic system turns glucose (sugar) from the blood into energy The process of metabolism dumps waste back into the blood The kidneys filter waste from the blood and balance fluids, which helps with blood pressure Blood pressure affects how the heart pumps blood into the body\n\n\"CKM health is about your overall health,\" said Sanchez. \"It's a full circle. You can take care of your overall health with regular checks of your blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, blood sugar and kidney function.\"\n\nHow the Survey Was Conducted\n\nThe Harris Poll carried out the survey in August 2025 on behalf of the American Heart Association to measure public awareness of CKM syndrome and CKM health. Approximately 4,000 U.S. adults participated. Health care professionals can find additional resources on interdisciplinary care and learn how to join the CKM Health Initiative at heart.org/CKMtools. The American Heart Association's Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Health Initiative is supported by Founding Sponsors Novo Nordisk® and Boehringer Ingelheim, Supporting Sponsors Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Bayer, and Champion Sponsor DaVita®.\n\nResearch Methodology\n\nThe research was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Heart Association among 4,007 US adults aged 18+. The survey was conducted 8/6 -- 8/22/2025.\n\nData were weighted by education, age by gender, race/ethnicity, region, household income, household size, marital status, employment and smoking status to reflect population proportions. Respondents were selected from individuals who agreed to participate in surveys.\n\nSampling precision for Harris online polls is measured using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, results are accurate within ± 2.0 percentage points at a 95% confidence level. Precision varies across subgroups. As with all surveys, additional sources of error may exist, including nonresponse, question wording and post-survey adjustments.\n\nNotes",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many people in the U.S. have health problems like heart disease, kidney issues, diabetes, or obesity. These problems often happen together, but most adults don’t know they are connected through something called CKM syndrome.\n\n**What happened** – A recent survey by the American Heart Association found that nearly 90% of U.S. adults have risk factors for CKM syndrome, which links heart, kidney, and metabolic health. Despite low awareness—only 12% had heard of CKM—most people want to learn how it is diagnosed and treated. The survey included about 4,000 adults and showed many misunderstand how these health problems affect each other.\n\n**Impact** – CKM syndrome is important because when heart, kidney, and metabolic problems occur together, they raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke, and heart failure more than any single issue alone. Understanding this connection helps doctors and patients work together to prevent serious illness. The American Heart Association plans to release official guidelines on CKM syndrome in 2026 to improve care.\n\n**What's next step** – The American Heart Association is offering new educational resources and working with healthcare teams to improve how they treat people with these overlapping conditions.
