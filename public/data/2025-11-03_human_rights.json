      "title": "How India's higher judiciary is steadily advancing transgender rights amid global anti-trans backlash",
      "summary": "At a time when global backlash against transgender rights is surging, the Supreme Court of India is moving towards the  “full realization\" of equality for transgender people under the law.",
      "content": "Today, supposed good-faith debates around gender theory are too often recast as a moral panic around gender, specifically, around what many on the right wing pejoratively call “gender ideology”. To be clear, from the very outset, the non-duality of gender is not an ideology; it is both theory and fact.\n\nFor instance, one of US President Donald Trump’s first actions after taking office for his second presidential term was to eliminate the word “transgender” from the official lexicon of the United States federal government. This came amidst his administration’s broader efforts to scrap federal DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies and dismantle USAID projects around the world, which have had disastrous repercussions globally. That same year, the United Kingdom Supreme Court handed down a disappointing ruling that held that under the UK’s Equality Act (2010) — the primary anti-discrimination legislation in the UK — transgender women could be excluded from single-sex spaces and services. Across Europe and Central Asia, too, transgender people are witnessing a sharp erosion of their rights and protections under the guise of “protecting traditional values”.\n\nThus, at a time when global backlash against transgender rights is surging, the Supreme Court of India is charting a totally different path, moving towards the “full realisation” of equality for transgender people under the law.\n\nA breath of fresh air\n\nThe Supreme Court of India’s recent jurisprudence on transgender rights is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise polluted, anti-transgender global climate.\n\nMore than 10 years ago, the Supreme Court of India, in NALSA v. Union of India (commonly known as the NALSA judgment), recognised the “third gender” as not only a legally distinct gender category under the law, but also endowed them with the same fundamental rights as everyone else. Then in 2019, the Indian government passed the much-contested Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 and the accompanying Rules, 2020, to codify the principles laid down in the NALSA judgment.\n\nOver the years, however, the on-the-ground impact of these progressive developments has remained limited, and transgender people continue to face multiple barriers in exercising their rights — including, and especially, in obtaining their official gender identification documents. Yet, amidst this administrative ambiguity at home and rising anti-transgender sentiment globally, India’s constitutional courts have continued to (somewhat surprisingly) stand by the transgender community through progressive and expansive interpretations of the law.\n\nRecent progressive developments\n\nMost recently, on October 20, 2025, in Jane Kaushik v. Union of India, the Supreme Court of India handed down an important judgment that directed the formation of a high-level advisory committee tasked with drafting a practical policy framework to strengthen transgender rights and ensure the effective implementation of the beneficial provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, in June 2025, the Andhra Pradesh High Court issued a landmark judgment clarifying that transgender women were to be legally recognised as women under Indian law. This ruling further affirmed that transgender women in heterosexual marriages were entitled to the same legal protections as cisgender women under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (which criminalises cruelty, harassment, and domestic abuse by a husband or his relatives).\n\nIt is worth noting that, unlike other jurisdictions that do not explicitly recognise the third gender as a distinct gender category, India’s constitutional position also means that transgender women are legally recognised in their own right, thereby ensuring that the advancement of their interests cannot be seen as an encroachment on or undermining of the rights of their female cisgender counterparts.\n\nA case in point is Shanavi Ponnusamy v. Ministry of Civil Aviation (2022), where a transgender woman seeking employment as a cabin crew member at Air India was forced to apply under the “female” category because no separate option existed for transgender applicants. Despite clearing all medical tests, she was ultimately denied employment. When she challenged the decision before the Supreme Court, the Court ruled in her favour. This was therefore not a case of a transgender woman attempting to unfairly “encroach upon women’s spaces”, as some right-wing activists might suggest, but rather an instance where the airline simply failed to provide a legally required, designated category or space for a transgender individual.\n\nSeveral other cases also echo this progressive judicial trend, including the widely reported 2023 same-sex marriage case. While the Supreme Court declined to grant legal recognition to same-sex marriages, it nevertheless made an exception for transgender people in heterosexual marriages and extended legal recognition to them. This marked a significant expansion from an earlier, narrower interpretation of the law, which recognised only a limited subset of such relationships under Hindu personal law alone.\n\nWhat next?\n\nWhile these cases collectively signal the higher judiciary’s proactive approach toward expanding the scope of transgender rights in India, there is still room for improvement. For instance, transgender persons in non-heterosexual relationships cannot yet have their marriages legally recognised. Similarly, various petitions challenging certain provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, were filed before the Supreme Court years ago but are still awaiting adjudication.\n\nThat being said, these judicial developments represent a promising trajectory, particularly when viewed in the troubling and volatile global context in which they are embedded. Therefore, there is reason to remain hopeful about India’s higher judiciary and its inclination to expand, rather than restrict, the scope of transgender rights under the law. This is a trend that activists can only hope continues in the years, if not decades, to come.",

      "personality_title": "India’s Supreme Court leads progress on transgender rights amid global setbacks",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Around the world, many countries are rolling back transgender rights and protections. In some places, laws and policies have been changed to limit the recognition and support for transgender people. This includes actions like removing the word “transgender” from government language or restricting transgender women’s access to certain spaces.\n\n**What happened** – India’s Supreme Court is taking steps in the opposite direction. Over the past decade, it has recognized transgender people as a distinct legal gender and given them equal rights. Recently, the Court ordered the creation of a special committee to develop policies that better protect transgender rights. Courts in India have also ruled that transgender women are legally women and deserve the same protections against abuse as others. These decisions make it easier for transgender people to get official documents and fight discrimination.\n\n**Impact** – This progress is important because it shows a strong legal commitment to equality in a time when many countries are moving backward. India’s approach recognizes transgender people both as a unique group and as women when appropriate, which helps protect their rights without harming others. For example, a transgender woman was able to challenge unfair hiring practices at a major airline, winning a court case that forced the company to respect her legal gender.\n\n**What’s next step** – While the Supreme Court’s rulings are promising, there is still work to do. Some legal challenges are still waiting to be decided, and not all transgender relationships are fully recognized by law. Activists and courts will likely continue pushing for clearer rules and better protections in the coming years.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – India’s Supreme Court is steadily expanding legal rights and protections for transgender people, setting an example during a global time of rising opposition to transgender equality.",
      "personality_title_fr": "La Cour suprême de l’Inde fait progresser les droits des personnes transgenres malgré un recul mondial",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Dans le monde, de nombreux pays réduisent les droits et protections des personnes transgenres. Certains changent leurs lois pour limiter la reconnaissance et le soutien des personnes transgenres, comme supprimer le mot « transgenre » dans le langage officiel ou restreindre l’accès des femmes transgenres à certains espaces.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – La Cour suprême de l’Inde agit à l’inverse. Depuis dix ans, elle reconnaît les personnes transgenres comme un genre légal distinct et leur accorde des droits égaux. Récemment, elle a ordonné la création d’un comité spécial pour élaborer des politiques protégeant mieux ces droits. Les tribunaux indiens ont aussi décidé que les femmes transgenres sont légalement des femmes et méritent les mêmes protections contre les violences.\n\n**Impact** – Ce progrès est important car il montre un engagement fort pour l’égalité alors que beaucoup de pays reculent. L’Inde reconnaît les personnes transgenres à la fois comme un groupe unique et comme femmes, protégeant ainsi leurs droits sans nuire aux autres. Par exemple, une femme transgenre a gagné un procès contre une compagnie aérienne qui refusait de respecter son genre légal.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Bien que ces décisions soient encourageantes, il reste du travail. Certains défis juridiques attendent encore d’être tranchés et toutes les relations transgenres ne sont pas encore reconnues par la loi. Les activistes et les tribunaux continueront probablement à chercher des règles plus claires et de meilleures protections.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – La Cour suprême de l’Inde étend progressivement les droits et protections légales des personnes transgenres, montrant une voie différente face à l’opposition mondiale croissante.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – En muchas partes del mundo, los derechos y protecciones para personas transgénero están siendo limitados. Algunos países han cambiado leyes para reducir el reconocimiento y apoyo a personas trans, como eliminar la palabra “transgénero” del lenguaje oficial o restringir el acceso de mujeres trans a ciertos espacios.\n\n**Qué pasó** – La Corte Suprema de India está tomando un camino diferente. Desde hace diez años, reconoce a las personas transgénero como un género legal distinto y les otorga derechos iguales. Recientemente, ordenó formar un comité especial para crear políticas que protejan mejor estos derechos. También ha dictaminado que las mujeres trans son legalmente mujeres y deben tener las mismas protecciones contra abusos.\n\n**Impacto** – Este avance es importante porque muestra un compromiso fuerte con la igualdad en un momento en que muchos países retroceden. India reconoce a las personas trans tanto como un grupo único como mujeres, protegiendo sus derechos sin afectar a otros. Por ejemplo, una mujer trans ganó un caso contra una aerolínea que no respetaba su género legal.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Aunque estas decisiones son prometedoras, queda trabajo por hacer. Algunos casos legales aún esperan resolución y no todas las relaciones trans están plenamente reconocidas. Activistas y tribunales seguirán trabajando para lograr reglas más claras y mejores protecciones.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – La Corte Suprema de India avanza en la expansión de derechos y protecciones legales para personas transgénero, marcando un ejemplo en un momento global de oposición creciente.",
