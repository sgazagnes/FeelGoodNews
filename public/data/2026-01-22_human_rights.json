The case also connects with wider international moves toward reparations and justice for people affected by colonial-era abuses.\n\n**What's next step** – The court’s decision in March will determine if the case moves forward.

      "summary": "It comes as the government looks into its own potential ban, with a consultation closing in the summer.",
      "content": "Lords back UK social media ban for under-16s\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Paul Seddon Political reporter Share Save\n\nPA Media\n\nThe House of Lords has backed a move to ban under-16s in the UK from social media platforms. By 261 votes to 150, opposition peers voted to support a ban through an amendment to the government's schools bill. The government has indicated it will try to overturn the amendment in the Commons, whilst it holds its own consultation on a potential ban. But this Commons vote could prove politically tricky for ministers, as some Labour MPs have said they also favour a ban for under-16s.\n\nPolitical momentum at Westminster in favour of a ban has grown since Australia's move last month to ban under-16s from 10 major platforms, with more than 60 Labour MPs recently joining the Conservative Party in urging a similar move. However, others some campaigners and children's charities have come out against the idea. Under the amendment backed by peers, the government would get a year to decide which platforms should be unavailable to under-16s, with companies forced to put in place \"highly effective\" age checks to police access. It was supported by Conservative, Liberal Democrat and crossbench peers, as well as two from Labour. Former Tory schools minister Lord Nash, one of those sponsoring the proposed change, said children's use of social media was a \"societal catastrophe\" and a ban would give teenagers a \"few more years to mature\" before using the platforms. He said there was \"overwhelming\" evidence about the damage caused by teenage social media use, arguing it was linked to mental health problems, online radicalisation and disruptive behaviour in classrooms. He dismissed the government's consultation as a \"last-minute attempt to kick the can down the road\", adding: \"What are we waiting for? We know our children are being harmed\".\n\n'Complex issue'\n\nOnline safety campaigner Baroness Kidron, another peer supporting the ban, said she worried the government's consultation would become the \"playground of the tech lobbyist\". \"The government has shown it will only act under pressure, not principle,\" she added. However, other peers urged caution about the proposal, with Labour peer Lord Knight of Weymouth arguing it could push teenagers towards \"less regulated platforms\". He added that a blanket ban would also deprive children of the more positive aspects of social media, adding that a better approach was to \"listen to young people\" during the government consultation. Several charities and campaign groups, including the NSPCC, have said a full ban risks \"unintended consequences,\" and have called instead for stronger enforcement of existing child safety rules. Asked earlier whether it would support the Lords' amendment, Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson said: \"Our position is clear. We won't accept the amendment. \"This is an extremely complex issue. We believe the right thing to do is to gather the necessary evidence and insight before changing the law.\" The government consultation, which will run for three months, will assess the merits of a ban for under-16s, as well as overnight curfews and actions to prevent \"doom-scrolling\". It will also look at whether more robust age checks could be implemented by social media firms, which could be forced to remove or limit features \"which drive compulsive use of social media\". The Liberal Democrats supported Lord Nash's amendment after failing to win support for their own rival plan to restrict children's social media use. The party added that it would put pressure on the government to \"come forward with concrete proposals for a workable plan\". \"While we may differ on the best approach, we believe there is a shared responsibility to act,\" added education spokesperson Munira Wilson.",

Recently, countries like Australia have started banning kids under 16 from using major social media platforms.

This vote happened recently, with 261 peers supporting the ban and 150 against it. The amendment is part of a schools bill and would require social media companies to check users’ ages carefully and block younger users. Some politicians from different parties supported this change, while others, including some charities, want more careful study before making a decision.\n\n**Impact** – This move is important because it shows a big step towards protecting children from harmful effects linked to social media, such as mental health problems and exposure to bad content. It also pushes companies to improve age checks, which could make online spaces safer. However, there is debate because some worry a ban might push kids to use unregulated sites or miss out on positive experiences social media can offer.\n\n**What’s next step** – The UK government is holding a consultation that will last three months to gather more evidence and opinions. They will look at the ban idea, as well as other options like setting time limits for social media use and stopping harmful habits like endless scrolling. After this, the government will decide whether to accept the ban or suggest other rules.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The UK House of Lords has voted to ban social media use for under-16s, aiming to protect young people’s well-being while the government studies the best way to keep children safe online.\n",

Ce vote a eu lieu récemment, avec 261 pairs pour et 150 contre.

Certains politiciens de différents partis soutiennent ce changement, tandis que d’autres, y compris des associations, souhaitent une étude plus approfondie avant de décider.\n\n**Impact** – Cette décision est importante car elle montre une avancée pour protéger les enfants des effets négatifs liés aux réseaux sociaux, comme les problèmes de santé mentale ou l’exposition à des contenus inappropriés. Elle incite aussi les entreprises à renforcer les contrôles d’âge, ce qui pourrait rendre les espaces en ligne plus sûrs. Cependant, certains craignent que l’interdiction pousse les enfants vers des sites moins contrôlés ou les prive des aspects positifs des réseaux sociaux.\n\n**Étape suivante** – Le gouvernement britannique organise une consultation de trois mois pour recueillir plus d’informations et d’opinions. Il étudiera l’idée de l’interdiction, ainsi que d’autres mesures comme des limites de temps d’utilisation ou la lutte contre le défilement compulsif. Ensuite, il décidera d’adopter ou non l’interdiction ou de proposer d’autres règles.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – La Chambre des Lords a voté pour interdire les réseaux sociaux aux moins de 16 ans afin de protéger leur bien-être, tandis que le gouvernement étudie la meilleure manière de garantir leur sécurité en ligne.\n",

MEPs want this list to be exhaustive and for the Commission to update it regularly.\n\nThe duty to provide stranded passengers with refreshments every two hours beyond the initial departure time, a meal after three hours, and an overnight stay of a maximum of three nights for long delays, should be retained in all circumstances, MEPs agree with the Council. The three-night limit would, they argue, offer airlines greater predictability and spare them undue financial costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFaster and simpler reimbursement\n\nMEPs want the introduction of pre-filled forms for compensation and reimbursement requests, to simplify claims processing and help passengers and airlines avoid the use of claims agencies. According to the draft rules, air carriers would need to send passengers experiencing travel disruptions (cancellation or delays) a pre-filled form within 48 hours of the incident (Council’s position requires a pre-filled form only after cancellation, not after long delays). Travellers would then have one year to file a request.\n\nStrengthening traveller protection\n\nParliament wants passengers to have the right to carry with them onto the airplane, at no additional cost, one personal item (such as a handbag, backpack or laptop) and one small piece of hand luggage with maximum dimensions of 100 cm (combined length, width and height) and seven kilograms.\n\nMEPs also want to scrap the additional fees travellers are sometimes forced to pay for correcting passenger name errors or for checking into their flight. Passengers should retain the right to choose between digital and paper boarding passes, they add.\n\nVulnerable passengers\n\nMEPs also pay special attention to passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility. These travellers should have the right to compensation, rerouting and assistance by airlines if they miss a flight due to airport’s failure to help them reach the gate on time, the text says. Passengers with reduced mobility, pregnant women, infants, and children in a pram with an accompanying person should be given priority when boarding, while their accompanying persons should be seated in an adjacent seat without incurring extra charges.\n\nQuote\n\nRapporteur Andrey Novakov (EPP, BG) said: ''Parliament is ready to continue the fight for clearer and more predictable rules for airlines and a stronger aviation sector, but not at the expense of passengers. Our baseline is clear: we are determined to improve rather than dilute air passenger rights. We insist that reducing delays has significant overall benefits for Europe’s economy. Therefore, the three-hour threshold for compensation, the existing compensation levels, pre-filled forms and enforceable safeguards remain our red lines. We are counting on EU transport ministers to reconsider their position so that together we may find a mutually acceptable outcome. Citizens expect us to deliver.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\nUnder the second reading procedure Parliament’s position will be sent to the Council. If the Council does not accept all of Parliament’s amendments, a so-called “Conciliation Committee” will be convened to find an agreement on the final shape of the bill.\n\nBackground information\n\nSince Parliament made proposals on air passenger rights reform in 2014, the progress to update these rules has stalled for 11 years in Council. In June 2025, however, EU ministers reached a political agreement, opening the way for negotiations with Parliament. The interinstitutional talks started in October 2025, but the negotiations did not result in an agreement, forcing Parliament to proceed with the adoption of its second reading position.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union has rules to protect air travelers if their flights are delayed, canceled, or if they are denied boarding. These rules have been in place since 2004, but EU member states recently suggested changes that could weaken these protections.\n\n**What happened** – On June 2026, the European Parliament voted strongly to keep and improve passenger rights. They rejected proposals to reduce compensation for delays and insisted that passengers should be compensated if their flight is delayed by more than three hours. They also want to make it easier for passengers to claim compensation by introducing pre-filled forms and to allow free cabin luggage for travelers.\n\n**Impact** – This decision means millions of travelers across Europe will continue to have strong protections when flights go wrong. Passengers will not only keep their right to fair compensation but will also benefit from simpler claims and better treatment for people with disabilities, pregnant women, and families with children. It sets clear rules for airlines and helps passengers avoid extra fees.\n\n**What's next step** – The European Parliament’s position will now be sent to the EU Council, where member states will discuss it. If they disagree, a special committee will work to find a final agreement. This process will decide the exact rules passengers will have in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The European Parliament has taken a clear stand to protect and improve the rights of air travelers, ensuring fair treatment and easier compensation across the EU.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’Union européenne dispose de règles pour protéger les voyageurs aériens en cas de retard, d’annulation ou de refus d’embarquement. Ces règles existent depuis 2004, mais des États membres ont récemment proposé des modifications qui pourraient affaiblir ces protections.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – En juin 2026, le Parlement européen a voté massivement pour maintenir et améliorer les droits des passagers. Il a rejeté les propositions de réduction des compensations et a insisté pour que les passagers soient indemnisés en cas de retard supérieur à trois heures. Il souhaite aussi faciliter les demandes d’indemnisation avec des formulaires pré-remplis et autoriser un bagage cabine gratuit.\n\n**Impact** – Cette décision garantit à des millions de voyageurs en Europe des protections solides en cas de problème de vol. Les passagers conserveront leur droit à une indemnisation juste, bénéficieront de démarches simplifiées et d’un meilleur traitement des personnes vulnérables comme les personnes handicapées, les femmes enceintes et les familles avec enfants. Cela fixe des règles claires pour les compagnies aériennes et évite des frais supplémentaires pour les passagers.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – La position du Parlement sera envoyée au Conseil de l’UE, où les États membres en discuteront. En cas de désaccord, un comité spécial sera créé pour trouver un accord final. Ce processus décidera des règles exactes pour les passagers à l’avenir.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le Parlement européen a pris position pour protéger et améliorer les droits des voyageurs aériens, assurant un traitement équitable et une indemnisation plus simple dans toute l’UE.\n",
