      "title": "Victorian parliament passes Australia’s first Indigenous treaty legislation",
      "summary": "\"Yesterday Victoria signed a Treaty. Today the sun is rising, so I guess it didn't cause the end of the world.\"",
      "content": "In a historic first, the State Parliament of Victoria has passed Australia’s first formal treaty with Indigenous First Peoples. It follows ten years of work with traditional owners.\n\nFirst Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria Co-Chair Rueben Berg talked to ABC News Breakfast the next morning abou the historic treaty:\n\nThe treaty is part of efforts to close the gap between Indigenous people and the rest of the Australian community.\n\nThe legislation establishes three key bodies: Gellung Warla (the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria as a permanent representative body), Nyerna Yoorrook Telkuna (a truth-telling body that will also incorporate truth-telling into Australia’s school curriculum), and Nginma Ngainga Wara (an accountability body). Additionally, an infrastructure fund will be created to give First Peoples greater control of the development projects that affect their communities.\n\nNgarra Murray, elected Co-Chair of the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria, explained why a treaty was needed:\n\nTreaty recognises that Aboriginal people are the experts when it comes to our Country, culture and communities — and makes sure we can use our local knowledge to come up with and deliver practical solutions to improve health, education, and housing outcomes for our communities.\n\nThe news was greeted warmly by many Aussies. Mastodon user @susan60 joined others who would like to see it extended nationally:\n\nPost by @Susan60@aus.social View on Mastodon\n\nHowever, not all Australians welcomed the legislation.\n\nSome opponents believe it will be racially divisive and that it goes against the national sentiment expressed in the rejection of the Federal Voice referendum proposal in 2023. The Voice was to be a permanent consultative body written into the Australian Constitution to offer Indigenous citizens more representation in Parliament; however, it was rejected after more than 60 percent of voters voted no on the referendum.\n\nMargaret Chambers at right-wing thinktank Institute of Public Affairs argued that:\n\n…the treaty will function as a Voice on steroids, creating a separate and parallel parliament based on race. [The treaty] will ensure that our democracy is transformed into a two-tier system based solely on ancestry.\n\nConservative parties opposed the treaty at both the State and Federal levels.\n\nThe conservative rural-based National Party and some of their Liberal Party allies doubled down on their earlier opposition to The Voice. Nationals Senate Leader Bridget McKenzie called Victoria’s treaty legislation “appalling”, while Liberal Victorian MP David Davis suggested that it would bring the state to a standstill.”\n\nVictorian Liberal leader Brad Battin was condemned for his promise to repeal the new law if elected to government in 2026. The pro-treaty “Together for Treaty” movement started an online petition calling for Battin to back down as part of its ongoing campaign.\n\nDavid Anthony’s comment on a SkyNews Facebook welcomed the treaty, which he described as unifying, not divisive.\n\nGreat to see Victoria embrace the Treaty. I still lament the loss of the Voice referendum as the perfect opportunity to ‘close the gap’ and make Australia a greater place. But state Treaties will be a huge help in improving the lives of thousands of people. Victoria coming to a standstill? That’s a pretty hysterical assertion made without evidence. Time for unity, not division.\n\nMost of the replies to Anthony’s comment were very negative, as might be expected on the right-leaning SkyNews, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. Brian Wray’s response reflected many of the anti-treaty views:\n\nI agree it’s time for unity, the rest of your rant is purely delusional. The Australian electorate voted NO. This action by the Allen government is treachery. Nothing less.\n\nSimilar arguments took place on several Reddit posts. This was a typical thread.\n\nThe official Treaty website emphasises that the new law will in no way: Change the Victorian or Commonwealth Constitution, establish a “third chamber of Parliament” in the legislative chamber or house of Victoria’s Parliament or change tax laws or provide individual financial “reparations.”\n\nThe day after the vote, Indigenous person Big T, sounded a note of optimism on BlueSky:\n\nYesterday Victoria signed a Treaty.Today the sun is rising, so I guess it didn't cause the end of the world. ❤️ — Big T (@big-tony.bsky.social) 2025-10-31T17:58:15.940Z\n\nThe full legislation can be read here.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Victoria, a state in Australia, has worked for ten years with Indigenous groups to create a treaty. This treaty aims to improve the lives of Indigenous people and recognize their special connection to the land and culture.\n\n**What happened** – In October 2025, Victoria’s Parliament passed the first formal Indigenous treaty law in Australia. The law creates three main groups: one to represent Indigenous people permanently, one to share honest stories about history and include them in schools, and one to make sure promises are kept. It also sets up a fund to help Indigenous communities control projects that affect them.\n\n**Impact** – This treaty is unique because it officially recognizes Indigenous people as experts in their own culture and land. It aims to help solve problems like health, education, and housing by using Indigenous knowledge. Many Australians welcomed this step, seeing it as a way to bring positive change. However, some people worry it might divide the country or create special rules based on race.\n\n**What's next step** – The treaty will now start to work through the new groups and fund, helping Indigenous communities have a stronger voice in decisions that affect them. Some political leaders want to stop the treaty in future elections, but supporters are campaigning to protect it. This law could inspire other parts of Australia to create similar agreements.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Victoria’s new Indigenous treaty law creates official bodies to empower Indigenous people and aims to improve their communities by recognizing their knowledge and rights.\n\n",

      "content": "Staff remain on the ground providing lifesaving services, and some 100 UNRWA shelters are housing more than 75,000 displaced people, according to a tweet.\n\nFollowing two years of deadly conflict, a “catch-up” campaign to immunise some 44,000 children under the age of three against measles, mumps and other illnesses kicked off on Sunday. They will also be screened for malnutrition.\n\nTweet URL\n\nKhawla, a mother-of-three from Beit Lahia in the north, told the UN that she arrived at a vaccination point in the Nussirat area on foot “just to get my children vaccinated and to make sure my daughter stays healthy too.” UN access critical UN aid coordination office OCHA added that “across Gaza, partners supported by the Occupied Palestinian Territory Humanitarian Fund are helping families replant fields, learn in safety, access protection services and more” and “these efforts are offering a fragile but vital lifeline.”\n\nIn an opinion piece first published in The Guardian, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini wrote that the “fragile ceasefire – the first phase of US president Donald Trump’s 20-point plan – offers some respite to an exhausted population.”\n\nHe warned, however, that “there is still much to worry about” as “access to shelter, food and clean water remains challenging” as winter fast approaches.\n\n“The UN, including UNRWA, has the expertise and the resources to address critical humanitarian needs effectively and at scale” but “must be allowed to work freely and independently”, he said.\n\nMr. Lazzarini stressed that “a truly peaceful future requires a genuine investment in a definitive political solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.”\n\nHe added that “justice needs to be delivered, and healing seriously addressed by both Palestinian and Israeli societies.”\n\nRed tape still blocking aid\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to ramp up aid are still being hampered by red tape, ongoing bans on key humanitarian partners, too few border crossings and routes, as well as persistent insecurity, UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq told journalists in New York.\n\nThis past weekend, teams reported shelling and navy fire in different parts of the Strip “though at much lower levels than before the ceasefire.”\n\nIn some areas, teams still have to coordinate every movement in advance with the Israeli authorities.\n\nOn Sunday, only two out of eight coordination attempts were fully facilitated. Four were impeded on the ground – including one that was delayed for 10 hours.\n\nDespite the challenges, the UN and partners “are seizing every opportunity to expand operations.”\n\nDamaged hospital rehabilitated\n\nMr. Haq said the Al Kheir Hospital in Khan Younis resumed operations last week after being forced out of service following attacks in February 2024.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) supported the rehabilitation by restoring water, sanitation, power and structural systems, and providing essential medical equipment and medicines.\n\n“WHO also set up a new 20-bed nutrition stabilization centre at the hospital to treat children with acute and severe malnutrition. This brings the total across Gaza to seven such centres, with 70 inpatient beds in all,” said Mr. Haq.\n\nPsychosocial support, winter clothing and water\n\nBetween Wednesday and Friday, humanitarian partners reached 1,500 children and 500 caregivers in southern Gaza with mental health and psychosocial support.\n\nNearly 40,000 winter clothing kits and pairs of shoes have been distributed to children under 10.\n\nAround 50,000 blankets were delivered between Wednesday and Saturday to hospitals and other sites.\n\nWater trucking continues across 2,000 locations in Gaza, restoring access to safe water.\n\nPartners have also distributed 15,000 hygiene kits and repaired a key water line in Gaza City’s Az Zaytoun neighbourhood, restoring part of the domestic supply.\n\nWest Bank ‘lifeline’\n\nUNRWA also “remains a lifeline” in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, where an Israeli military operation in the north, launched at the beginning of the year, has resulted in displacement and destruction.\n\nTweet URL\n\nAt the same time, settler violence has been escalating amid a shrinking humanitarian space.\n\nThe Director of UNRWA Affairs in the West Bank, Roland Friedrich, said the agency has over 4,600 staff there, making it the second biggest service provider and employer after the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThey support over 930,000 registered refugees across the territory.\n\nHealthcare and education\n\nMore than 48,000 children attend 96 UNRWA schools five days a week while 43 health facilities have carried out more than 700,000 medical consultations so far this year.\n\n“We have 270,000 vulnerable Palestinian refugees that benefit from social protection, from cash assistance,” he said in a video posted on social media.\n\n“And we do that in a context, in a humanitarian situation, that is the most severe that the West Bank has seen since 1967.”\n\nWide-ranging impact\n\nMr. Friedrich said the “unprecedented escalation of violence” in the north has displaced more than 30,000 people from three refugee camps.\n\n“UNRWA remains a lifeline,” he said.\n\n“We make a distinct contribution, not only to addressing the humanitarian needs of Palestine refugees in the West Bank, and to improving their livelihood and their welfare, but we also make a distinct contribution to stability on the ground and in the region.”",
