      "content": "Memory problems may not be an unavoidable part of getting older. New findings from Virginia Tech reveal that age-related memory loss stems from specific molecular changes in the brain, and that fine-tuning these processes can help restore memory function.\n\nIn two complementary studies, Timothy Jarome, an associate professor in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences' School of Animal Sciences, and his graduate students used advanced gene-editing tools to target these molecular changes and improve memory performance in older rats. Rats are commonly used as models for understanding how memory declines with age.\n\n\"Memory loss affects more than a third of people over 70, and it's a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease,\" said Jarome, who also serves in the School of Neuroscience. \"This work shows that memory decline is linked to specific molecular changes that can be targeted and studied. If we can understand what's driving it at the molecular level, we can start to understand what goes wrong in dementia and eventually use that knowledge to guide new approaches to treatment.\"\n\nAdjusting Memory Pathways in the Hippocampus and Amygdala\n\nIn the first study, published in Neuroscience and led by Jarome and doctoral student Yeeun Bae, the researchers investigated a molecular process called K63 polyubiquitination. This process acts like a tagging system that directs proteins inside brain cells on how to behave. When it functions properly, it helps neurons communicate effectively and form memories.\n\nThe researchers discovered that aging alters this process in two important brain regions. In the hippocampus, which is responsible for forming and retrieving memories, K63 polyubiquitination levels rise with age. Using a gene-editing system called CRISPR-dCas13, the team lowered those levels and observed improved memory in older rats.\n\nIn contrast, in the amygdala -- a region crucial for emotional memory -- K63 polyubiquitination decreases with age. When the researchers further reduced this activity, memory performance also improved.\n\n\"Together, these findings reveal the important functions of K63 polyubiquitination in the brain's aging process,\" Jarome explained. \"In both regions, adjusting this one molecular process helped improve memory.\"\n\nReactivating a Dormant Gene to Improve Memory\n\nThe second study, published in the Brain Research Bulletin and led by Jarome and doctoral student Shannon Kincaid, focused on IGF2, a growth-factor gene known to support memory formation. As the brain gets older, IGF2 activity declines as the gene becomes chemically silenced within the hippocampus.\n\n\"IGF2 is one of a small number of genes in our DNA that's imprinted, which means it's expressed from only one parental copy,\" Jarome said. \"When that single copy starts to shut down with age, you lose its benefit.\"\n\nThe team found that this silencing occurs through DNA methylation, a natural process that adds chemical tags to DNA, turning the gene off. Using the CRISPR-dCas9 gene-editing system, they removed these tags and successfully reactivated IGF2. Older rats showed significant memory improvement once the gene was turned back on.\n\n\"We essentially turned the gene back on,\" Jarome said. \"When we did that, the older animals performed much better. Middle-aged animals that didn't yet have memory problems weren't affected, which tells us timing matters. You have to intervene when things start to go wrong.\"\n\nMultiple Molecular Systems Influence Brain Aging\n\nTogether, these studies reveal that memory loss during aging doesn't result from a single cause. Instead, it involves several molecular systems that change over time.\n\n\"We tend to look at one molecule at a time, but the reality is that many things are happening at once,\" Jarome said. \"If we want to understand why memory declines with age or why we develop Alzheimer's disease, we have to look at the broader picture.\"\n\nCollaborative Research Led by Graduate Scientists\n\nBoth projects were driven by graduate researchers in Jarome's lab and carried out with collaborators at Rosalind Franklin University, Indiana University, and Penn State. Yeeun Bae led the K63 polyubiquitination study, while Shannon Kincaid led the IGF2 project.\n\n\"These projects represent the kind of graduate-led, collaborative research that defines our work,\" Jarome said. \"Our students are deeply involved in designing experiments, analyzing data, and helping shape the scientific questions we pursue.\"\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the American Federation for Aging Research.\n\n\"Everyone has some memory decline as they get older,\" Jarome added. \"But when it becomes abnormal, the risk for Alzheimer's disease rises. What we're learning is that some of those changes happening at a molecular level can be corrected -- and that gives us a path forward to potential treatments.\"",

      "summary": "A Northwestern team transformed a common chemotherapy drug into a powerful, targeted cancer therapy using spherical nucleic acids. The redesign dramatically boosted drug absorption and cancer-killing power while avoiding side effects. This innovation may usher in a new era of precision nanomedicine for cancer and beyond.",
      "content": "In a major step toward improving cancer treatment, researchers at Northwestern University have redesigned the molecular structure of a widely used chemotherapy drug, making it far more soluble, potent, and less toxic to the body.\n\nThe scientists built a new form of the drug using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), a type of nanostructure that embeds the drug directly into DNA strands coating tiny spheres. This re-engineering turned a weak, poorly dissolving chemotherapy drug into a highly targeted cancer-fighting agent that spares healthy tissue.\n\nA Dramatic Boost Against Leukemia\n\nThe new therapy was tested in animals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a fast-growing and hard-to-treat blood cancer. Compared with the standard chemotherapy version, the SNA-based drug entered leukemia cells 12.5 times more efficiently, destroyed them up to 20,000 times more effectively, and slowed cancer progression 59-fold -- all without detectable side effects.\n\nThis success highlights the growing promise of structural nanomedicine, a field that precisely controls the composition and architecture of nanomedicines to improve how they interact with the human body. With seven SNA-based treatments already in clinical testing, researchers believe this approach could pave the way for new vaccines and therapies for cancers, infections, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nThe findings were published on Oct. 29 in ACS Nano.\n\n\"Stopping Tumors in Their Tracks\"\n\n\"In animal models, we demonstrated that we can stop tumors in their tracks,\" said Northwestern's Chad A. Mirkin, who led the research. \"If this translates to human patients, it's a really exciting advance. It would mean more effective chemotherapy, better response rates, and fewer side effects. That's always the goal with any sort of cancer treatment.\"\n\nMirkin is a leading figure in chemistry and nanomedicine, serving as the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Medicine at Northwestern. He also directs the International Institute for Nanotechnology and is a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nRethinking a Classic Chemotherapy Drug\n\nFor this study, Mirkin's team revisited 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu), a long-standing chemotherapy drug known for its limited efficiency and harsh side effects. Because it affects healthy cells as well as cancerous ones, 5-Fu can cause nausea, fatigue, and in rare cases, heart complications.\n\nMirkin explained that the issue lies not in the drug itself but in its poor solubility. Less than 1% dissolves in many biological fluids, meaning most of it never reaches its intended targets. When a drug cannot dissolve well, it clumps together or remains solid, preventing the body from absorbing it effectively.\n\n\"We all know that chemotherapy is often horribly toxic,\" Mirkin said. \"But a lot of people don't realize it's also often poorly soluble, so we have to find ways to transform it into water soluble forms and deliver it effectively.\"\n\nHow Spherical Nucleic Acids Transform Drug Delivery\n\nTo overcome this limitation, the researchers turned to SNAs -- globular nanoparticles surrounded by dense shells of DNA or RNA. Cells readily recognize these structures and pull them inside. In this case, Mirkin's team chemically incorporated the chemotherapy molecules into the DNA strands themselves, creating a drug that cancer cells naturally absorb.\n\n\"Most cells have scavenger receptors on their surfaces,\" Mirkin explained. \"But myeloid cells overexpress these receptors, so there are even more of them. If they recognize a molecule, then they will pull it into the cell. Instead of having to force their way into cells, SNAs are naturally taken up by these receptors.\"\n\nOnce inside, enzymes break down the DNA shell, releasing the chemotherapy payload directly into the cancer cell. This structural redesign completely changed how 5-Fu interacted with leukemia cells, dramatically increasing its effectiveness.\n\nPrecision Targeting With Minimal Harm\n\nIn mouse models, the new therapy nearly eliminated leukemia cells in the blood and spleen while significantly extending survival time. Because the SNAs selectively targeted AML cells, healthy tissues remained unharmed.\n\n\"Today's chemotherapeutics kill everything they encounter,\" Mirkin said. \"So, they kill the cancer cells but also a lot of healthy cells. Our structural nanomedicine preferentially seeks out the myeloid cells. Instead of overwhelming the whole body with chemotherapy, it delivers a higher, more focused dose exactly where it's needed.\"\n\nNext Steps Toward Clinical Trials\n\nThe research team now plans to test the approach in a larger group of small animal models before advancing to larger animals and, ultimately, human clinical trials, once additional funding becomes available.\n\nThe study, titled \"Chemotherapeutic spherical nucleic acids,\" was supported by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, with further support from the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.",

      "content": "A research team at the University of Missouri has made a discovery that could transform how glaucoma is detected and treated. Glaucoma, a major cause of irreversible blindness in older adults, often goes undiagnosed until significant vision loss has already occurred. Scientists are now closer to identifying a biomarker that may allow doctors to detect the disease much earlier and develop new ways to protect the eye.\n\nGlaucoma occurs when retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons become damaged. These delicate nerve cells, located at the back of the eye, carry visual information to the brain. Once they deteriorate, vision loss begins. Current therapies mainly reduce pressure inside the eye, but none effectively protect RGCs from harm. This gap in treatment highlights the urgent need for neuroprotective strategies that can preserve these critical nerve cells.\n\nSearching for Biomarkers and Protective Treatments\n\nPawan Singh, a researcher at Mizzou's School of Medicine, is dedicated to finding both biomarkers that reveal glaucoma early and therapies that safeguard the optic nerve. His team recently discovered that glaucoma patients have lower levels of two naturally occurring molecules, agmatine and thiamine, in the clear fluid at the front of the eye compared with individuals without the disease. These small molecules, known as metabolites, may serve as early indicators that can be detected through testing.\n\n\"In several cases, people do not find out they have glaucoma until they are older and their eye pressure is elevated,\" Singh explained. \"Our long-term goal is to see if doctors could one day do a simple blood test to check for these biomarkers. If they can, hopefully they will be able to catch the disease much earlier, before vision loss occurs, so patients can receive treatment sooner.\"\n\nPromising Clues for Future Treatments\n\nBeyond diagnosis, the discovery offers hope for new therapies. Singh's pre-clinical research suggests that agmatine and thiamine may help protect RGCs and maintain visual function, offering neuroprotective potential. These molecules could eventually be developed into treatments, possibly in the form of eye drops or supplements, that slow or prevent vision loss from glaucoma.\n\n\"Mizzou's impressive research infrastructure and our collaborative team help make this research possible,\" Singh said. \"While more work needs to be done, the eye doctors I have spoken to here at Mizzou are very excited about this research, so I am proud and hopeful for the future.\"\n\nThe findings were published in Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science under the title \"Metabolomic profiling of aqueous humor from glaucoma patients identifies metabolites with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential in mice.\"",

Sacchet\n\nMany of us have downloaded mindfulness apps like Headspace or Calm, and have probably benefited from spending 10 minutes each day focusing on our breathing. But reducing stress and softening the sharper edges of anxiety in this way are beginners’ steps when it comes to the practice of meditation.\n\nPut in the hours, though, and you may well reach the deep end: a place where radical, long-lasting upgrades to how you feel and what you experience are possible. This reality has long been known by full-time contemplatives spending their lives in monasteries and caves. Now, these mental transformations are being examined and understood by neuroscientists at world-leading institutions.\n\nAt the frontier of this new wave of research is Matthew Sacchet, director of the Meditation Research Program at Harvard Medical School. His team works hand in hand with advanced meditators, such as Buddhist monks, exploring how the material brain changes because of subjective experiences that are often considered spiritual in nature.\n\nUsing state-of-the-art brain scanners, his team pinpoints the neural changes that occur across a variety of deep meditative practices – and investigates what the lasting impacts are.\n\nSpeaking to New Scientist, he explains how devoted meditation practice can rewrite experiences of emotion and physical pain, what extreme altered states can teach us about the nature of consciousness, and the technological possibilities of bringing these advanced practices to more people.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Health Check Expert insight and news on scientific developments in health, nutrition and fitness, every Saturday.

Far less research has investigated what we call advanced meditation, which involves deeper, ongoing mastery of practice that includes altered mental states – and even transformations of conscious experience and ways of being. Our research programme studies this mastery of meditation and asks: what are the limits of meditation? What’s possible beyond mindfulness?\n\nWhat sort of things do you think are possible?\n\nWhat’s possible with advanced meditation is quite profound. Beyond mindfulness-related stress reduction, advanced practitioners report experiences of ecstatic bliss, deep insights into their own minds, radical compassionate states and prosocial ways of being, and even shifts in their fundamental sense of self. Advanced meditators sometimes report states of consciousness that are described as deeply peaceful, mentally clear or subjectively non-dual – meaning there is no perceived distinction between self and other.\n\nThese aren’t just subjective reports: we observe changes in the brain that support their existence. It’s also important to note that advanced and long-term meditation seem to have the capacity to foster enduring well-being. In that sense, meditation becomes not just a temporary tool for feeling a little bit better, but a powerful pathway to human flourishing.\n\nHow does meditation impact how we feel emotions and physical pain?\n\nIn a recent review, along with my team at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, and including collaborators from the University of Arizona, Sorbonne University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we evaluated the scientific literature related to cognition in long-term meditators who have at least 1500 hours of meditation experience, reflecting consistent daily practice over several years.\n\nWe identified a number of patterns across these studies: for instance, long-term meditation seems to change how sensations and emotions are processed, which can impact everyday experiences. Many of these effects are associated with brain systems involved in what our minds pay attention to, which can alter our experience of pain, how we make sense of that information in relation to ourselves and how we regulate our emotions. These brain systems include the salience network, default mode network and affective network, which includes the amygdala, a brain region implicated in processing fear, anxiety and aggression.\n\nOne particularly important insight was that long-term meditators may not rely primarily on “top-down” cognitive control – as one might expect from traditional views of self-regulation, in which higher-level brain regions guide us towards our long-term goals. Instead, long-term meditators seem to display more automatic, “bottom-up” forms of brain processing that are more rooted in sensory information. This suggests that their brains may be altered to respond more intuitively and efficiently to emotions and sensations, rather than needing to engage the brain’s deliberate control mechanisms each time.\n\nMatthew Sacchet (right) prepares an fMRI brain scanner to study the neural activity of a Buddhist monk (left) Matthew D. Sacchet\n\nThe ideas you are exploring are often coded as “spiritual” and might seem outlandish to some. Why do you think the scientific community has begun to accept these as research questions?\n\nWith the mainstreaming of mindfulness science and psychedelic science, and developments in cognitive neuroscience, there’s also growing acceptance of going deeper into the mind in ways that historically have been seen as untouchable from a scientific perspective. There are so many crises facing modern society – in mental health, climate, economy, religion and politics – that I believe have contributed to more openness for potential solutions. The challenge that we have in this space is threading the needle between using the best scientific methods and studying phenomenon that have been historically relegated to the spiritual or the religious.\n\nWhat are the practical challenges of this research? I’m guessing that asking someone to meditate deeply while hooked up to a brain scanner in a laboratory isn’t that easy…\n\nIt’s difficult to find individuals who can reliably access advanced meditative states in a controlled research environment. In practice, we take a lot of time with each meditator before they even come to our brain imaging centre. We educate participants on the data collection environment, what they can do to prepare for their time with us and the protocols that we’ll ask them to complete – all so that there are fewer surprises during data collection.\n\nWhat kinds of radically altered states of mind can you study in this way?\n\nOne type is what we call advanced concentrative absorption meditation, which includes a series of states of deep concentration that have been called jhānas in some schools of Buddhism. These are reported to arc from bliss to peace to deep stillness and eventually equanimity – an even-minded state of calmness and composure. Other cultures and traditions report similar meditation experiences that are also characterised by specific attentional qualities, intense concentration and reduced visual, auditory and bodily sensations.\n\nWe’ve found that absorption practice induces complex changes in the brain, specific to the given states. The neuroscientific picture is still complex, but there is consistency in how these states appear in the brain across individuals who access them. One example is that, during absorption, we observe a shift in brain activity from the front parts to the back parts of the brain. This maps onto the reported experiences of the meditators, which relates to reduced top-down cognitive control and how that shapes perception.\n\nCan these altered states tell us anything about the nature of consciousness?\n\nStudies of long-term meditators suggest that what we experience as a fixed self may be more fluid than previously understood. Neuroimaging studies show that significant alterations in brain activity – for instance, in those regions related to attention, bodily awareness and self-related processing – are linked to practitioners’ subjective reports of altered experiences.\n\nWhat we call cessation events, a type of meditative endpoint, could also help us to understand what consciousness is. Cessation of consciousness is described as a dramatic and brief event that can occur during advanced meditation, such as when someone has mastered advanced investigative insight. It involves a momentary complete absence of conscious experience. Some describe the onset of this event as a sort of falling away, or dissolution, of experience itself. With the return of consciousness after cessation, meditators report profound mental clarity and equanimity. Extended cessations that can last several days also happen. Cessation might sound similar to the experience of emerging from deep sleep, but cessation reports from advanced meditators are distinct, as they involve truly exceptional degrees of peace and lucidity.\n\nAs well as the absence of consciousness, advanced meditation includes highly refined or subtle forms of consciousness that we systematically compare in brain scanners, allowing us to isolate neural features unique to these different aspects of consciousness. This can help us understand the edges and limits of human experience.\n\nAre these cessation events similar to the idea that advanced meditation can, ultimately, allow you to “transcend suffering”?\n\nYes. We call this the study of meditative endpoints, or major milestones of practice that may include major, persistent shifts in experience and ways of being. This is a sort of holy grail for our research.\n\nMeditative endpoints, including what might be called “transcending suffering”, appear to go by different names in different traditions like Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, including “enlightenment”, “awakening” and “salvation”. If we can understand these phenomena, that would be an incredible step for science and, I believe, for humanity.\n\nIn our initial research on this topic, we’re seeing that different traditions emphasise different qualities, experiences and beliefs related to these meditative endpoints. These might include an emphasis on ways of being in which you no longer experience negative emotions or stress, or alternatively, if negative emotions do arrive, then perhaps they do not capture attention and lead to suffering. Other traditions emphasise meditative endpoints that involve an experience of non-duality, or ways of being that have no experiential distinction between “self” and “other”. People who experience increasing levels of non-duality report that they experience a more peaceful and free way of being.\n\nLong-term meditation seems to change how sensations and emotions are processed, which can impact everyday experiences Andre Babiak / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nHow long does it take to reach such extreme states of mind?\n\nMeditative endpoints, for most people, are going to require considerable time and commitment. But there are individual differences in meditative capacities and also anecdotal reports of spontaneous events. We have studied some deep practitioners with only hundreds of hours of practice, whereas others may need far more experience before advanced meditation. Think of it like how some people can do 10 pull-ups without any training and others can’t do a single one.\n\nStill, I think this path is valuable, even if one doesn’t experience such a meditative endpoint. For example, we study eight jhāna absorption states and different “lighter” and “deeper” forms of each. Experiencing a lighter form of the initial jhāna alone could be very powerful and may not take very long to learn.\n\nHow do we know such changes are real?\n\nThere may always be at least some concern about fabrication when conducting research using subjective, self-reported phenomena. But we conduct extensive interviews to better understand the experience of our research participants. And we are inclined to believe that people can, in fact, know and report on their experiences, even the deep experiential aspects of advanced meditation.\n\nOur neuroscientific research already shows that advanced meditation is real in the sense that these experiences track meaningfully to brain measurements, and are distinct from what we’d see in the brains of people under anaesthesia or who are asleep or on psychedelics. That’s compelling evidence for something deeper going on here than mere confabulation.\n\nHow do you hope to make advanced meditation more available to people?\n\nThe first step is to make the concepts underlying advanced meditation more accessible. This includes informing people that there really is something there, something beyond mindfulness, and that it has radical potential. Exploring how we might democratise access to advanced meditation is key for us. One of the goals of our research is to meet people where they are, so they can benefit from advanced meditation.\n\nThis might simply involve teaching with clear verbal instructions, but there is also potential to explore more sci-fi ideas, like using neurotechnology. Neuromodulation technologies can use electrical or magnetic stimulation to locally excite or inhibit brain activity. An important open question is whether such interventions can facilitate advanced meditation, a question that may be informed by our research on the neural hallmarks of these experiences. There are a lot of challenges and ethical questions related to this, of course.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Meditation is often used to reduce stress and anxiety, but scientists are now studying how mastering meditation deeply can change the brain and how we experience pain, emotions, and even consciousness itself.\n\n**What happened** – Neuroscientist Matthew Sacchet and his team at Harvard Medical School have been working with advanced meditators, such as Buddhist monks, using brain scanners like EEG and fMRI to study changes in brain activity during deep meditation. Their research shows that long-term meditation practice rewires the brain to process sensations and emotions differently, making people feel less pain and stress. They also study rare states of consciousness, like moments when awareness temporarily disappears, which meditators describe as peaceful and clear.\n\n**Impact** – This research is important because it provides scientific evidence that meditation can lead to lasting changes in well-being, not just temporary relaxation. It shows that the brain can shift from effortful control to more natural, automatic responses to emotions and pain. Understanding these states helps scientists learn more about how consciousness works and how people might overcome suffering in new ways.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers want to make advanced meditation more accessible to everyone, not just experienced monks. This could involve clear teaching methods or new technologies that help stimulate the brain to reach these states. The team also plans to continue studying different meditation experiences to better understand their effects and how they might improve mental health.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Advanced meditation can change the brain to reduce pain and emotional suffering while revealing new insights into human consciousness and well-being.",
