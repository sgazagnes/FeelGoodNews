      "title": "Twenty-year study shows cleaner water slashes cancer and heart disease deaths",
      "summary": "A 20-year project in Bangladesh reveals that lowering arsenic levels in drinking water can slash death rates from major chronic diseases. Participants who switched to safer wells had the same risk levels as people who were never heavily exposed. The researchers tracked individual water exposure with detailed urine testing. Their results show how quickly health improves once contaminated water is replaced.",
      "content": "A large 20-year investigation following nearly 11,000 adults in Bangladesh found that reducing arsenic in drinking water was tied to as much as a 50 percent drop in deaths from heart disease, cancer and several other chronic illnesses. The research offers the strongest long-term evidence so far that lowering arsenic exposure can reduce mortality, even for people who lived with contaminated water for many years. These results appear in JAMA.\n\nScientists from Columbia University, the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health and New York University led the analysis, which addresses a widespread health concern. Naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater remains a significant challenge across the world. In the United States, more than 100 million people depend on groundwater that can contain arsenic, particularly those using private wells. Arsenic continues to be one of the most common chemical contaminants in drinking water.\n\n\"We show what happens when people who are chronically exposed to arsenic are no longer exposed,\" said co-lead author Lex van Geen of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, part of the Columbia Climate School. \"You're not just preventing deaths from future exposure, but also from past exposure.\"\n\nTwo Decades of Data Strengthen the Evidence\n\nCo-lead author Fen Wu of NYU Grossman School of Medicine said the findings offer the clearest proof yet of the connection between lowering arsenic exposure and reduced mortality risk. Over the course of two decades, the researchers closely tracked participants' health and repeatedly measured arsenic through urine samples, which strengthened the precision of their analysis.\n\n\"Seeing that our work helped sharply reduce deaths from cancer and heart disease, I realized the impact reaches far beyond our study to millions in Bangladesh and beyond now drinking water low in arsenic,\" said Joseph Graziano, Professor Emeritus at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health and principal investigator of the NIH-funded program. \"A 1998 New York Times story first brought us to Bangladesh. More than two decades later, this finding is deeply rewarding. Public health is often the ultimate delayed gratification.\"\n\nClear Drop in Risk When Arsenic Exposure Falls\n\nPeople whose urinary arsenic levels fell from high to low had mortality rates that matched those who had consistently low exposure for the entire study. The size of the drop in arsenic was closely tied to how much mortality risk declined. Those who continued drinking high-arsenic water did not show any reduction in chronic disease deaths.\n\nArsenic naturally accumulates in groundwater and has no taste or smell, meaning people can drink contaminated water for years without knowing it. In Bangladesh, an estimated 50 million people have consumed water exceeding the World Health Organization's guideline of 10 micrograms per liter. The WHO has described this as the largest mass poisoning in history.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2022, the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) monitored thousands of adults in Araihazar, Bangladesh. The project tested more than 10,000 wells in a region where many families rely on shallow tube wells with arsenic levels ranging from extremely low to dangerously high.\n\nResearchers periodically measured arsenic in participants' urine, a direct marker of internal exposure, and recorded causes of death. These detailed data allowed the team to compare long-term health outcomes for people who reduced their exposure with those who remained highly exposed.\n\nCommunity Efforts Created a Natural Comparison Group\n\nThroughout the study period, national and local programs labeled wells as safe or unsafe based on arsenic levels. Many households switched to safer wells or installed new ones, while others continued using contaminated water. This created a natural contrast that helped researchers understand the effects of reducing exposure.\n\nArsenic exposure decreased substantially in Araihazar during the study. The concentration in commonly used wells fell by about 70 percent as many families sought cleaner water sources. Urine tests confirmed a corresponding decline in internal exposure, averaging a 50 percent reduction that persisted through 2022.\n\nReduced Exposure Brings Lasting Health Benefits\n\nThese trends held true even after researchers accounted for differences in age, smoking and socioeconomic factors. Participants who remained highly exposed, or whose exposure rose over time, continued to face significantly higher risks of death from chronic diseases.\n\nThe researchers compared the health benefits of lowering arsenic to quitting smoking. The risks do not disappear immediately but drop gradually as exposure decreases.\n\nIn Bangladesh, well testing, labeling unsafe sources, drilling private wells and installing deeper government wells have already improved water safety for many communities.\n\n\"Our findings can now help persuade policymakers in Bangladesh and other countries to take emergency action in arsenic 'hot spots',\" said co-author Kazi Matin Ahmed of the University of Dhaka.\n\nTo reach more households, the research team is collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to make well data easier to access. They are piloting NOLKUP (\"tubewell\" in Bangla), a free mobile app created from more than six million well tests. Users can look up individual wells, review arsenic levels and depths, and locate nearby safer options. The tool also helps officials identify communities that need new or deeper wells.\n\nClean Water Investments Can Save Lives\n\nThe study shows that health risks can fall even for people who were exposed to arsenic for years. This highlights an important opportunity: investing in clean water solutions can save lives within a single generation.\n\n\"Sustainable funding to support the collection, storage and maintenance of precious samples and data over more than 20 years have made this critically important work possible,\" said Ana Navas-Acien, MD, PhD, Professor and Chair of Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. \"Science is difficult and there were challenges and setbacks along the way, but we were able to maintain the integrity of the samples and the data even when funding was interrupted, which has allowed us to reveal that preventing arsenic exposure can prevent disease.\"\n\nThe study team included researchers from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Boston University School of Public Health, the Department of Geology at the University of Dhaka and the Institute for Population and Precision Health at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe HEALS project was launched by Columbia University through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Superfund Research Program, with most U.S. collaborators based at Columbia when the study began.",

      "content": "At 15 my best friend promised she'd have my baby. Now I'm a mum\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Yasmin Rufo BBC News Share Save\n\nGeorgia Barrington Daisy gave birth to Georgia's baby, Ottilie, in October\n\nGeorgia Barrington has just become a new mother but she isn't the one who gave birth to her daughter. Instead, that moment belonged to her best friend, Daisy Hope, who carried the baby for her after a promise made when they were teenagers. The women have been inseparable their whole lives. They call themselves \"soul sisters\" and have grown up together as their fathers are best friends. Their childhood closeness would later become the foundation for a life-changing act of generosity. At 15, Georgia was told something no young girl expects to hear - she had been born without a womb and would never carry a child. The diagnosis, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, affects around one in 5,000 women and for Georgia, it felt like her future had been rewritten in a single moment. \"It was devastating, my whole world had fallen apart,\" she recalls. \"I'd always grown up thinking I would be a mum and that was ripped out from under me and everything I ever dreamed of had gone.\" Back then, Daisy wasn't particularly maternal and she remembers the diagnosis vividly and how \"unfair\" it felt that her friend who had always wanted to have a child couldn't. \"I wanted her to feel ok and to give her some hope that it wasn't the end of the world so I said that I would carry a baby for her one day,\" she tells Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett. \"I don't think I understood what I was saying then but I always knew this was something I was going to do for Georgia.\"\n\nGeorgia Barrington Georgia and Daisy have been best friends since childhood and grew up together\n\nMore than a decade later, Daisy followed through on that promise and in 2023 the two women began the IVF process. Georgia had trained as a midwife, immersing herself in the world she feared she could never be part of. \"I was asked once whether this was the right career for me,\" she says. \"But actually, it helped me heal and deep down I knew I'd have a child one way or another.\" Years later, Daisy had her first child – with Georgia as her midwife - and becoming a mum herself strengthened her conviction to fulfil her promise. \"The love I felt for my child was amazing and I thought everyone should be able to have that feeling,\" she says. She admits she was a \"bit naïve\" at the beginning as she had a straightforward pregnancy with her daughter and so \"assumed everything would go smoothly again\".\n\n'Hope dropped away'\n\nShe became pregnant with the first embryo and everything seemed to be progressing normally and both women allowed themselves to believe the future they'd imagined was finally happening. But a scan at seven weeks revealed an empty womb. Georgia remembers the moment the nurse said she couldn't see anything on the scan. \"I had this sinking feeling, and all hope just dropped away,\" she says. A week later it was confirmed that the embryo hadn't become a baby. \"I thought it was all my fault,\" admits Daisy who found the grief overwhelming, feeling she had let her friend down, while Georgia struggled with the realisation that even their most promising attempt hadn't succeeded. Still, they tried again and on the second time, something felt different as Daisy says: \"When I found out I was pregnant again, I thought the world cannot be this cruel twice.\"\n\nGeorgia Barrington Daisy says she always knew she was going to carry Georgia's baby\n\nSix weeks in, the pair sat in a hospital room holding their breath as a tiny heartbeat appeared on the screen, but later that day, Daisy began to bleed heavily. \"I thought it was happening all over again and I was terrified,\" she says. She bled for six hours and was convinced she had miscarried but when doctors checked, the heartbeat was still there and the pregnancy continued to full term. Daisy went into labour slightly earlier than expected and a few months ago gave birth to a baby girl. Georgia was so overwhelmed in the moment she \"forgot to check the sex of the baby\". \"As soon as I saw the baby's head, I just lost it and we were all crying.\" She says she still struggles to believe she really has a child and wishes she could \"take this moment and hand it to my 15-year-old self, sitting in that GP surgery\". As Georgia talks of how \"lucky and grateful\" she feels, Daisy says she always knew she would help her best friend out however she could. \"We have this bond that no one will ever have with their friends because we've been through something so personal.\"",

      "summary": "Texas A&M researchers found a way to make stem cells produce double the normal number of mitochondria using nanoflower particles. These energized stem cells then transfer their surplus “power packs” to weakened cells, reviving their energy production and resilience. The method bypasses many limitations of current mitochondrial therapies and could offer long-lasting effects. It may open the door to treatments for aging tissues and multiple degenerative diseases.",
      "content": "Biomedical researchers at Texas A&M University report that they may have found a way to halt, or even reverse, the loss of cellular energy that comes with damage and aging. If future studies confirm the results, the discovery could lead to major changes in how many diseases are treated across medicine.\n\nDr. Akhilesh K. Gaharwar and Ph.D. student John Soukar, together with colleagues in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, have created a technique that supplies injured cells with fresh mitochondria. By replenishing these tiny energy producers, the method can restore energy output to previous levels and greatly improve the overall health of the cells.\n\nMitochondrial decline has been tied to aging, heart disease and several neurodegenerative conditions. A strategy that strengthens the body's natural capacity to replace worn-out mitochondria could, in principle, help address all of these problems at once.\n\nAs human cells grow older or are harmed by degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, or by exposure to harmful agents like chemotherapy drugs, their ability to generate energy steadily drops. A key reason is the shrinking number of mitochondria, the small, organ-like structures inside cells that supply most of the energy a cell uses. Whether in brain tissue, heart muscle or other organs, a decrease in mitochondria leads to weaker, less healthy cells that eventually can no longer perform their essential roles.\n\nNanoflowers Turn Stem Cells Into Mitochondria Donors\n\nThe research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, combined microscopic, flower-shaped particles called nanoflowers with stem cells. When stem cells were exposed to these nanoflowers, they began producing about twice as many mitochondria as usual. When the strengthened stem cells were then placed next to damaged or aging cells, they passed along their extra mitochondria to these neighboring, injured cells.\n\nOnce supplied with new mitochondria, the previously damaged cells were able to restore their energy production and normal activity. These revived cells not only showed improved energy levels but also became more resistant to cell death, even when they were later exposed to damaging treatments such as chemotherapy.\n\n\"We have trained healthy cells to share their spare batteries with weaker ones,\" said Gaharwar, a professor of biomedical engineering. \"By increasing the number of mitochondria inside donor cells, we can help aging or damaged cells regain their vitality -- without any genetic modification or drugs.\"\n\nAlthough cells are naturally capable of exchanging small amounts of mitochondria, the nanoflower-treated stem cells, which the team describes as mitochondrial bio factories, transferred two to four times more mitochondria than untreated stem cells.\n\n\"The several-fold increase in efficiency was more than we could have hoped for,\" said Soukar, lead author of the paper. \"It's like giving an old electronic a new battery pack. Instead of tossing them out, we are plugging fully-charged batteries from healthy cells into diseased ones.\"\n\nMaking Mitochondria Therapies Last Longer\n\nResearchers have tried other ways to increase the number of mitochondria inside cells, but these approaches often come with tradeoffs. Drug-based methods rely on small molecules that leave cells relatively quickly, so patients may need frequent and repeated treatments to maintain the effect. In contrast, the larger nanoparticles (which are roughly 100 nanometers in diameter) remain inside the cell and continue to stimulate mitochondria production more effectively. As a result, therapies based on this nanoflower technology might only need to be administered about once a month.\n\n\"This is an early but exciting step toward recharging aging tissues using their own biological machinery,\" Gaharwar said. \"If we can safely boost this natural power-sharing system, it could one day help slow or even reverse some effects of cellular aging.\"\n\nMolybdenum Disulfide Nanoparticles in Biomedical Use\n\nThe nanoflowers are made from molybdenum disulfide, an inorganic compound that can form many different two-dimensional shapes at very small scales. The Gaharwar Lab is among a small number of research groups investigating how molybdenum disulfide might be used for biomedical purposes.\n\nStem cells already play a central role in cutting-edge work on tissue repair and regeneration. Using nanoflowers to increase the performance of stem cells could mark an important step in making these cells even more effective in future therapies.\n\nVersatile Approach for Many Tissues\n\nOne of the most promising aspects of the technique is its flexibility. Although the method is still in early stages and requires much more testing, it could theoretically be used to treat loss of function in many different tissues throughout the body.\n\n\"You could put the cells anywhere in the patient,\" Soukar said. \"So for cardiomyopathy, you can treat cardiac cells directly -- putting the stem cells directly in or near the heart. If you have muscular dystrophy, you can inject them right into the muscle. It's pretty promising in terms of being able to be used for a whole wide variety of cases, and this is just kind of the start. We could work on this forever and find new things and new disease treatments every day.\"\n\nThe project received financial support from the National Institutes of Health, the Welch Foundation, the Department of Defense, and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. Additional backing came from the President's Excellence Fund at Texas A&M University and the Texas A&M Health Science Center Seedling Grant. Key collaborators included Texas A&M researchers Dr. Irtisha Singh, Dr. Vishal Gohil, and Dr. Feng Zhao.",

      "summary": "Spermine, a small but powerful molecule in the body, helps neutralize harmful protein accumulations linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

      "content": "Researchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI have clarified how spermine - a small molecule that regulates many processes in the body's cells - can guard against diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's: it renders certain proteins harmless by acting a bit like cheese on noodles, making them clump together. This discovery could help combat such diseases. The study has now been published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nngs could contribute to new ways of tackling these brain disorders. The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nAs people live longer, age-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are becoming more common. These conditions are driven by harmful buildups in the brain made of misfolded amyloid proteins. These protein structures form long, thin fibers that resemble strands of spaghetti. So far, there is no effective treatment that can reliably prevent or clear these protein deposits.\n\nSpermine as a natural protector in cells and animals\n\nA naturally occurring molecule in the body called spermine is offering new hope. In laboratory experiments, a team led by Jinghui Luo at the Center for Life Sciences at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI showed that spermine can extend the lifespan of small nematode worms, improve their movement as they age, and strengthen their cellular power plants, the mitochondria. The researchers saw that spermine supports the body's immune system in removing nerve-damaging amyloid protein deposits.\n\nThese new results may form the foundation for developing new therapeutic strategies for diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n\nSpermine is essential for the functioning of the organism. It belongs to a group of relatively small organic molecules known as polyamines. Spermine was first identified more than 150 years ago and named after seminal fluid, where it is present in particularly high concentrations. However, it is also found in many other cell types throughout the body, especially in cells that are active and capable of dividing.\n\nGene regulation and biomolecular condensation\n\nSpermine supports cell movement and activity and is involved in many different cellular processes. One of its main roles is to interact with the nucleic acids in the genome, helping regulate which genes are switched on and how they are translated into proteins. This regulation ensures that cells can grow, divide, and eventually die in a controlled manner. Spermine is also crucial for a cellular process called biomolecular condensation. In this process, large molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids separate and gather into droplet-like regions inside the cell, creating small reaction hubs where important biochemical reactions take place.\n\nIn the context of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, earlier work had already suggested that spermine can protect nerve cells and ease age-related memory problems. What was missing until now was a clear picture of how spermine influences the harmful processes in nerve cells in a way that could be used for medical benefit.\n\nHelping cells clear toxic protein waste\n\nLuo's research group has now examined these mechanisms in greater depth. In addition to optical microscopy, the scientists used a method called SAXS scattering at PSI's Swiss Light Source SLS to investigate the molecular dynamics of the processes involved. They studied these effects both in glass capillaries (in vitro) and in living organisms (in vivo). For the living system, they used the nematode C. elegans as a model organism.\n\nTheir experiments showed that spermine causes harmful proteins to come together and form clumps through biomolecular condensation. This behavior supports a routine cellular cleanup process known as autophagy. In autophagy, damaged or unnecessary proteins are enclosed in small membrane-bound vesicles and then broken down safely by enzymes, effectively recycling cellular components.\n\n\"Autophagy is more effective at handling larger protein clumps,\" says study leader Luo. \"And spermine is, so to speak, the binding agent that brings the strands together. There are only weakly attractive electrical forces between the molecules, and these organise them but do not firmly bind them together.\"\n\nThe entire process, Luo explains, can be imagined like a plate of spaghetti. \"The spermine is like cheese that connects the long, thin noodles without gluing them together, making them easier to digest.\"\n\nFrom kitchen metaphor to future therapies\n\nSpermine also appears to play a role in other diseases, including cancer. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms in these conditions, after which spermine-based treatments could become realistic options. Alongside spermine, many other polyamines also perform important tasks in the body and are therefore of medical interest. This makes the field highly promising for future research. \"If we better understand the underlying processes,\" says Luo, \"we can cook tastier and more digestible dishes, so to speak, because then we'll know exactly which spices, in which amounts, make the sauce especially tasty.\"\n\nAI and advanced imaging accelerate spermine research\n\nArtificial intelligence is also being used in this search, because it can calculate promising combinations of \"ingredients for the sauce\" much more quickly on the basis of all available data. Luo also points out that time-resolved scattering measurements and high-resolution imaging, which can capture these processes in real time down to the subcellular level, are crucial for this work and for future studies. Outside of PSI, such advanced methods are available at only a few other synchrotron facilities worldwide.\n\nResearchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI have clarified how spermine - a small molecule that regulates many processes in the body's cells - can guard against diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's: it renders certain proteins harmless by acting a bit like cheese on noodles, making them clump together. This discovery could help combat such diseases. The study has now been published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nOur life expectancy keeps rising - and as it does, age-related illnesses, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, become increasingly common. These diseases are caused by accumulations in the brain of harmful protein structures consisting of incorrectly folded amyloid proteins. Their shape is reminiscent of fibres or spaghetti. To date, there is no effective therapy to prevent or eliminate such accumulations.\n\nYet a naturally occurring molecule in the body called spermine offers hope. In experiments, researchers led by study leader Jinghui Luo, in the Center for Life Sciences at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI, have discovered that this substance is capable of extending the life span of small nematode worms, improving their mobility in old age, and strengthening the powerhouses of their cells - the mitochondria. Specifically, the researchers observed how spermine helps the body's immune system eliminate nerve-damaging accumulations of amyloid proteins.\n\nThe new findings could serve as a basis for developing novel therapies for such diseases.\n\nA central mediator of cellular processes\n\nSpermine is a vital substance for the organism. It belongs to the so-called polyamines, which are relatively small organic molecules. Spermine, first discovered more than 150 years ago, is named after the seminal fluid, as it is found in particularly high concentrations there. But it also occurs in many other cells of the body - especially those that are active and capable of dividing.\n\nSpermine promotes cell mobility and activity and controls numerous processes. Above all, it interacts with the nucleic acids of the genome, regulating the expression of genes and their conversion into proteins. This ensures that cells can properly grow and divide and ultimately die. Spermine is also central to an important cellular process called biomolecular condensation: In this process, certain macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, segregate and collect within the cell in a droplet-like form, so that important reactions can take place there.\n\nIn connection with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, there has previously been evidence that spermine can protect nerve cells and alleviate age-related memory loss. Lacking until now, however, has been a more precise understanding of how spermine intervenes in nerve-damaging processes - understanding that might make it possible to derive medical benefits from it.\n\nAssisting cellular waste removal\n\nJinghui Luo's group has now investigated this in more detail. In addition to optical microscopy, the researchers also used the SAXS scattering technique at PSI's Swiss Light Source SLS to shed light on the molecular dynamics of these processes. The investigations were conducted both in a glass capillary (in vitro) and in a living organism (in vivo). The nematode C. elegans served as a model organism.\n\nIt was shown that spermine causes the harmful proteins to gather and, in a sense, clump together through biomolecular condensation. This facilitates a process called autophagy, which occurs routinely in our cells: Damaged or unnecessary proteins are wrapped up in small membrane vesicles and safely degraded with enzymes - a natural recycling process, in effect.\n\n\"Autophagy is more effective at handling larger protein clumps,\" says study leader Luo. \"And spermine is, so to speak, the binding agent that brings the strands together. There are only weakly attractive electrical forces between the molecules, and these organise them but do not firmly bind them together.\"\n\nThe whole thing, says Luo, can also be imagined like a plate of spaghetti. \"The spermine is like cheese that connects the long, thin noodles without gluing them together, making them easier to digest.\"\n\nWanted: the right combination of ingredients\n\nSpermine also exerts an influence on other diseases, including cancer for example. Here too research is needed to clarify the mechanisms at work - then spermine-based therapeutic approaches would be conceivable. In addition to spermine, there are many other polyamines that fulfil important functions in the organism and thus are medically interesting. Therefore research in this area has a lot of potential. \"If we better understand the underlying processes,\" says Luo, \"we can cook tastier and more digestible dishes, so to speak, because then we'll know exactly which spices, in which amounts, make the sauce especially tasty.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence is also being used in this search, because it can calculate promising combinations of \"ingredients for the sauce\" much more quickly on the basis of all available data. Luo also notes that time-resolved scattering measurement techniques and high-resolution imaging, which can depict such processes in real time and down to the subcellular level, are also important for this and subsequent studies. Apart from PSI, such methods are available at only a few other synchrotron facilities in the world.",
