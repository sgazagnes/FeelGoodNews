      "title": "A two-way street: Reversing brain drain in Somalia",
      "summary": "For many countries in crisis, brain drain can feel like an unbreakable loop. Armed conflict, climate shocks and economic downturn drive out local experts who take with them the know-how that is essential to reversing the crisis.  ",
      "content": "So the crisis continues. And the brain drain intensifies.\n\nBut what if there was a way to reverse brain drain? This is the question that the International Organization of Migration (IOM) has been asking about Somalia.\n\n“There has been a lot of brain drain in Somalia. How do we bring back those skills that they have been able to achieve in their country of residence to their country of origin?” said Yvonne Jepkoech Chelmio, an IOM official focused on labour and migration in Africa.\n\nThe IOM’s Migration in Africa for Development Programme (MIDA) selects members of the Somali diaspora who are experts in their chosen fields and places them in local hospitals, schools and national ministries in order to build Somalia’s self-sufficiency.\n\nIn the past 20 years, MIDA has sponsored the return of over 400 Somalis from 17 different countries. These returnees have worked in many fields — including education and health, as well as climate action, urban planning and the rule of law — all with the hope of advancing sustainable development in Somalia.\n\n© IOM Through the MIDA program, Somali diaspora were placed in hospitals to mentor local doctors.\n\n‘Drivers of change’\n\nThe Somali Civil War which began in 1991 provoked mass displacement, both internally and externally. More than 30 years later, the situation has improved but security continues to be an issue, which in turn is imperilling sustainable development.\n\n“What happens in countries like Somalia is someone becomes skilled in a field, educated, they don’t want to stay here. So you lose talent, you lose skill,” said pedagogy expert, Shire Salad, a diaspora participant in the MIDA program who was placed in the Ministry of Education to work alongside their evaluation development team.\n\nWith two million Somalis living abroad, the Somali diaspora has long played an integral role in the country’s economy. The money they send back as remittances sometimes outpaces direct foreign aid, totalling over $2 billion annually and contributing at least one-third of the national GDP.\n\n© IOM/Spotlight Communications Solar panels provide consistent power to the university in Abudwaq, Galmadug.\n\nBut MIDA deviates from a solely economic understanding of the diaspora’s contributions, instead creating avenues for their return which emphasise their technical skills, expertise and international networks.\n\n“[The diaspora] serve as bridges, as ambassadors, as drivers of change and development actors,” said Nasra Sheikh Ahmed, one of the IOM officials in charge of the programme.\n\nAnd according to Ms. Ahmed, who is a member of the Somali diaspora herself, one of the most remarkable things about the MIDA programme is that it seizes upon something which already exists — the Somali diaspora wants to return.\n\n“[The diaspora] still see it as their home. They’re not immigrants in another country. They still see themselves as Somalis. They see themselves as an extension, basically just living somewhere else.”\n\nEducation at the core\n\nWhile the MIDA programme has operated across many sectors one of the main sectors on which the MIDA programme has focused is education.\n\n© UNICEF/Maslah Mumin\n\nMohamed Gure, a professor at Somali National University, participated in the MIDA programme as a local professional who worked alongside members of the diaspora to improve the curriculum for aspiring teachers.\n\nWhen Dr. Gure began his studies years ago, he said that there were no programmes in Somalia which offered a doctoral degree in education. So he, like many others, went abroad.\n\nToday, he sees a new sort of problem — not enough Somalis want to become teachers, and those that do believe that they do not need a formal training.\n\n“Teachers in the classroom do not have training in being a teacher. This will affect the quality of education in Somalia in the long-term,” Dr. Gure said.\n\nOver the course of a few years, Dr. Gure worked alongside diaspora professionals to develop a new curriculum and create a lasting partnership with the University of Helsinki in Finland.\n\nFor him, the benefits of this new curriculum are already clear — students are learning more, and the online collaborations with students in Helsinki are creating an international network of expertise.\n\n“All this [training] is a resource for the country. All the curricula that were developed for the country will remain. It will be used by lecturers who can train other lecturers,” Dr. Gure said.\n\n© IOM The MIDA program has focused on empowering the education sector in Somalia.\n\nA two-way street\n\nPartnerships, like that which Dr. Gure experienced, are an essential part of the MIDA programme’s long-term impact, ensuring that even after the diaspora professional leave, their contributions remain.\n\n“We have not just provided skills transfer to two people, but these two people can now transfer to four people. So there’s more sustainability in terms of process,” Ms. Chelmio said.\n\nBut this skills transfer is not without challenges. Many of the diaspora who are returning to Somalia have been gone for years, sometimes decades. The Somalia to which they return is quite different from the one they left.\n\n“Although you may speak the language and you may understand that culture, they still see you as a foreigner,” said Dr. Salad, who left Somalia when he was quite young and “returned with grey hairs.”\n\nSoundcloud\n\nAdapting expertise to the Somali context is essential for sustainable development, and this is something that the local professionals are uniquely equipped to do, creating a two-way street with both parties acting as experts in their own right.\n\n“[The diaspora] don’t understand the context, the dynamic of the country itself. The local expert is able to give the diaspora expert the perspective,” Ms. Chelmio said.\n\nA future in which Somalis stay\n\nMIDA has, in small ways, reversed the brain drain of the past decades. It has brought back hundreds of diaspora members. And even if they have not stayed, their skills and expertise have.\n\nBut, Somalis are still leaving the country, risking their lives on boats to the Gulf and to Europe out of pure hopelessness And many of them die.\n\nDr. Salad hopes that one day for Somalia, there will be no brain drain to reverse.\n\n“If they had hope in this country, they would have stayed. If they believed this country was going to be a better country, they would have stayed. My hope is that younger generations will have that hope, that they will stay.”",

Some 33 men now aged between 96 and 105, who served in military in the Far East and Pacific, were the guests of honour at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Wreaths were laid by the royal couple before a flypast by the RAF's Red Arrows and a national two-minute silence. The event heard moving accounts from veterans and civilians caught up in the war. Earlier, the King released an audio message in which he hailed the courage and sacrifice of the veterans.\n\nVJ Day, or Victory over Japan Day, is commemorated on 15 August each year and marks the date in 1945 when Japan surrendered to Allied forces, bringing World War Two to an end after nearly six years. An estimated 71,000 soldiers from the UK and the Commonwealth died fighting Japan, including upwards of 12,000 prisoners of war.\n\nPA Media Sir Keir Starmer laid a wreath as the King and Queen looked on\n\nPA Media\n\nActress Celia Imrie narrated the story of the war in the Far East at the service organised by the Royal British Legion, as the experiences of those who took part were told in person and through films shown on a screen. George Durrant, who served in the intelligence corps, appeared on stage with his great-granddaughter as he paid tribute to a fallen comrade, saying he was present \"not as a hero but as someone who witnessed the price of freedom\". Royal Navy veteran Alfred Conway, from Lincolnshire, watched as his great-grandchildren laid a wreath on the Burma Thailand Railway memorial at the Arboretum. There was also a tribute from poet Sir Ben Okri to the contributions of soldiers who had enlisted from countries in the British Commonwealth to fight in Burma (now Myanmar). The Queen appeared to wipe away a tear as veteran Yavar Abbas, originally from Lucknow in India, went briefly off-script \"to salute my brave King, who is here with his beloved Queen in spite of the fact that he is under treatment for cancer\". The 105-year-old added that he hoped it would bring \"comfort\" that he had been free of cancer for 25 years.\n\nPA The Queen appeared to shed a tear as Yavar Abbas spoke\n\nPA Media Veteran Alfred Conway watched on as his great-grandchildren laid a wreath\n\nEddie Mulholland/Daily Telegraph/PA Wire King Charles with Charlie Richards, 104, at the reception after the service\n\nThe service - also attended by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - concluded with a flypast by World War Two-era aircraft, the Spitfire, Hurricane and Lancaster bomber. A reception was then held for the King and Queen to meet the veterans and their families.\n\nAmong those at the service was Edward Hadfield, now 100, who served in the 8th Punjab Regiment in Burma and was on a boat in the Indian Ocean on VJ Day. \"You've never heard such a cheer in your life,\" he recalled to the BBC. \"The war was over, and you were alive, and I was alive.\" However, he said he had also remembered friends who did not survive who \"gave [their] today so we can have our tomorrow\".\n\nEdward Hadfield was on a boat in the Indian Ocean when VJ Day was declared\n\nKatharine Canning spent her early childhood in an internment camp in Japanese-occupied China\n\nKatharine Canning, 83, was also at the National Memorial Arboretum. She was 11 months old when her family were declared \"enemy aliens\" in Japanese-occupied China. Along with her parents and brother, she was taken to an internment camp, where she spent the first few years of her life and recalls being rescued by paratroopers on VJ Day, when she was three years old.\n\nAnother veteran at the event, Stanley Roberts, 99, said the VJ Day ceremony was \"deeply important\" as \"we won't be around for the 90th\". The son of a Japanese military doctor travelled to the UK to attend the ceremony too. Yoshi Sekiba said he was paying his respects to the British troops who died, explaining: \"Unfortunately, we fought with each other in World War Two, but we are now good friends.\"\n\nStanley Roberts said the VJ Day ceremony was \"deeply important\"\n\nIn a message released before the service, King Charles vowed that those who fought and died in the Pacific and Far East \"shall never be forgotten\". He reflected on the moment 80 years ago that his grandfather, King George VI, announced that the war was over - \"the message a battle-weary world had long prayed for\". He said he spoke now in the \"same spirit of commemoration and celebration, as we honour anew all those whose service and sacrifice saw the forces of liberty prevail\". The King referred to the British, Commonwealth and Allied forces who continued to fight for months after the war in Europe had ended, who became known as the \"Forgotten Army\". He noted the \"horrific\" conditions prisoners of war endured in Japanese captivity, and the \"grievous hardships\" innocent civilians in occupied territories faced. \"Their experience reminds us that war's true cost extends beyond battlefields, touching every aspect of life - a tragedy all-too vividly demonstrated by conflicts around the world today.\"\n\nKing Charles marks 80 years since VJ Day in speech to nation\n\nThe King also acknowledged the \"immense price\" paid by the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where more than 200,000 people died as a result of the US atomic bombings in August 1945. He said it was a \"price we pray no nation need ever pay again\". The King added: \"But in recalling so much suffering, we must not lose sight of how great was the cause and how sweet the victory.\" He went on to cite the collaboration across faiths and cultural divides, and said the \"courage and camaraderie displayed in humanity's darkest hour is a flame that shall blaze for eternity - a beacon that honours our past and guides our future\".\n\nPA Media The service concluded with a flypast by World War Two-era aircraft, the Spitfire, Hurricane and Lancaster bomber",

But it allows Lebanon’s government-appointed top public prosecutor to order other prosecutors to cease ongoing legal proceedings and limits the ability of Lebanon’s highest judicial body to overcome government gridlock and obstruction in judicial appointments.“After years of unrelenting efforts by Lebanese rights and judicial groups, Lebanon’s parliament made progress but didn’t fully seize the opportunity to protect Lebanon’s judiciary from political interference,” said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “While the law is progressive in many ways, unaddressed gaps continue to threaten the independence of the judiciary and open it up for continued political interference.”Lebanon’s parliament speaker reportedly signed the law on August 7 and forwarded it to Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and President Joseph Aoun to sign it into law. Lebanon’s government and parliament should now work to amend the law and bring it in line with international standards for judicial independence, including recommendations provided by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), Human Rights Watch said. The law is set to go into effect in January 2026. In May, prior to the draft law going before parliament, Lebanese rights and judicial groups welcomed the government’s approval of the draft Law on the Independence of the Judiciary, which was later renamed to the Law Regulating the Ordinary Judiciary, stating that it was “a promising step toward reform.” The groups, including the Coalition for Judicial Independence in Lebanon and Legal Agenda, who in 2018 introduced an original version of the draft law to parliament, called on parliament to further amend the law and bring it in line with international standards. “When the law was drafted in 2018, we included very high standards on judicial independence,” said Nizar Saghieh, executive director of Legal Agenda. “There are several positive developments with this current version of the law, relating to judicial elections, transparency and freedom of expression and association, but it is still very far from where it should be.”The text adopted by parliament largely ignored many of the civil society recommendations. The process of adopting the law was also marred by significant violations of the legislative process. They included last minute amendments that parliament members could not review before voting and a haphazard tallying process that led some reporters and members of parliament to conclude that the draft law did not receive a majority of the votes. “We didn’t discuss the law nor vote on it. They called out some names [of parliamentarians] and then the law was approved,” said MP Halimeh Kaakour [LS1] in a video published on social media. The new law contains advancements for judicial independence. It expands the participation of judges in judicial electoral processes, allowing judges to nominate themselves to various judicial positions, and strengthens judicial self-governance, including over promotions, discipline, and the assignment of judges to cases. It also tasks the Supreme Judicial Council, the country’s highest judicial body, with developing internal judicial regulations and a judicial code of conduct.The law acknowledges judges’ rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association, and requires judges to notify the head of the Supreme Judicial Council 48 hours before a media appearance. Article 53 says that “judges are independent in carrying out their work” and “may not be moved, assessed, disciplined or suspended from the judiciary except in accordance with the scope of the law.” Article 77 says that “a judge may not be suspended except in accordance with the law and may not be moved from their position within four years, without their consent.” Under the law, a judge cannot remain in a specific position for more than 5 years and should be moved to an equal or higher position after that, unless the judge is facing disciplinary measures.The law also limits the executive branch’s role in selecting judges for the Supreme Judicial Council. Under the new law, 4 of the 10 members are to be elected by members of Lebanon’s judiciary, four are to be ex officio members appointed by the government on the basis on nominations put forward by the Supreme Judicial Council, and two would be selected by the eight sitting members of the council. Members would serve for a nonrenewable five-year period. While the introduction of judges elected by other judges to the highest judicial body is noteworthy, the original version of the draft stipulated that the judiciary would elect a majority of Supreme Judicial Council members, as the Venice Commission had recommended. But as Legal Agenda reported, parliament’s Administration and Justice Committee amended the law to increase the number of government-appointed members from three to four.The most concerning provision is article 42, which enables the country’s top public prosecutor, who is appointed by the government based on nominations put forward by the Supreme Judicial Council, to request that lower-level prosecutors stop ongoing legal proceedings. This would, grant the prosecutor excessive powers and the ability to intervene in ongoing investigations, Human Rights Watch said. The law also limits the ability of the Supreme Judicial Council to overcome government gridlock over judicial appointments by requiring 7 out of the 10 members to approve appointing judges over the government’s objection. The Lebanese Judges’ Association criticized the law on July 31, saying that it “reinforces sectarianism, renews political interference in the judiciary, and reaffirms the Supreme Judicial Council’s deprivation of any independence, administrative or financial.” The association accused the parliamentary committee of ignoring its recommendations and those from the Venice Commission. Lebanese rights groups have previously criticized attempts by both the Administration and Justice Parliamentary Committee and the former justice minister to amend the draft in a manner that contravenes international standards.The Venice Commission adopted separate opinions on the Draft Law on Independence and Transparency of the Judiciary in 2022, later renamed the Law Organizing the Ordinarily Judiciary, and a Draft Law on the Administrative Judiciary in 2024, providing the Lebanese government and parliament with recommendations intended to bring provisions regulating the judiciary in line with international standards.Lebanon’s government should also advance further judicial reforms by working with parliament to remove civilians from the jurisdiction of Lebanon’s military courts. In recent years, Lebanese authorities have used the military court’s legal jurisdiction over civilians as a means to intimidate or punish them for political activism or to stamp out dissent. The military court should only have jurisdiction over purely military matters, but never when a civilian is the alleged victim or defendant.“The adoption of this law serves as a first step in the reform of the judiciary, but the fight will not be over until Lebanese leaders finally scuttle legal provisions used to interfere with and stymie the work of the judiciary,” Kaiss said. ",

But it allows Lebanon’s government-appointed top public prosecutor to order other prosecutors to cease ongoing legal proceedings and limits the ability of Lebanon’s highest judicial body to overcome government gridlock and obstruction in judicial appointments.\n\n“After years of unrelenting efforts by Lebanese rights and judicial groups, Lebanon’s parliament made progress but didn’t fully seize the opportunity to protect Lebanon’s judiciary from political interference,” said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “While the law is progressive in many ways, unaddressed gaps continue to threaten the independence of the judiciary and open it up for continued political interference.”\n\nLebanon’s parliament speaker reportedly signed the law on August 7 and forwarded it to Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and President Joseph Aoun to sign it into law. Lebanon’s government and parliament should now work to amend the law and bring it in line with international standards for judicial independence, including recommendations provided by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), Human Rights Watch said. The law is set to go into effect in January 2026.\n\nIn May, prior to the draft law going before parliament, Lebanese rights and judicial groups welcomed the government’s approval of the draft Law on the Independence of the Judiciary, which was later renamed to the Law Regulating the Ordinary Judiciary, stating that it was “a promising step toward reform.” The groups, including the Coalition for Judicial Independence in Lebanon and Legal Agenda, who in 2018 introduced an original version of the draft law to parliament, called on parliament to further amend the law and bring it in line with international standards.\n\n“When the law was drafted in 2018, we included very high standards on judicial independence,” said Nizar Saghieh, executive director of Legal Agenda. “There are several positive developments with this current version of the law, relating to judicial elections, transparency and freedom of expression and association, but it is still very far from where it should be.”\n\nThe text adopted by parliament largely ignored many of the civil society recommendations. The process of adopting the law was also marred by significant violations of the legislative process. They included last minute amendments that parliament members could not review before voting and a haphazard tallying process that led some reporters and members of parliament to conclude that the draft law did not receive a majority of the votes.\n\n“We didn’t discuss the law nor vote on it. They called out some names [of parliamentarians] and then the law was approved,” said MP Halimeh Kaakour [LS1] in a video published on social media.\n\nThe new law contains advancements for judicial independence. It expands the participation of judges in judicial electoral processes, allowing judges to nominate themselves to various judicial positions, and strengthens judicial self-governance, including over promotions, discipline, and the assignment of judges to cases. It also tasks the Supreme Judicial Council, the country’s highest judicial body, with developing internal judicial regulations and a judicial code of conduct.\n\nThe law acknowledges judges’ rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association, and requires judges to notify the head of the Supreme Judicial Council 48 hours before a media appearance. Article 53 says that “judges are independent in carrying out their work” and “may not be moved, assessed, disciplined or suspended from the judiciary except in accordance with the scope of the law.”\n\nArticle 77 says that “a judge may not be suspended except in accordance with the law and may not be moved from their position within four years, without their consent.” Under the law, a judge cannot remain in a specific position for more than 5 years and should be moved to an equal or higher position after that, unless the judge is facing disciplinary measures.\n\nThe law also limits the executive branch’s role in selecting judges for the Supreme Judicial Council. Under the new law, 4 of the 10 members are to be elected by members of Lebanon’s judiciary, four are to be ex officio members appointed by the government on the basis on nominations put forward by the Supreme Judicial Council, and two would be selected by the eight sitting members of the council. Members would serve for a nonrenewable five-year period.\n\nWhile the introduction of judges elected by other judges to the highest judicial body is noteworthy, the original version of the draft stipulated that the judiciary would elect a majority of Supreme Judicial Council members, as the Venice Commission had recommended. But as Legal Agenda reported, parliament’s Administration and Justice Committee amended the law to increase the number of government-appointed members from three to four.\n\nThe most concerning provision is article 42, which enables the country’s top public prosecutor, who is appointed by the government based on nominations put forward by the Supreme Judicial Council, to request that lower-level prosecutors stop ongoing legal proceedings. This would, grant the prosecutor excessive powers and the ability to intervene in ongoing investigations, Human Rights Watch said. The law also limits the ability of the Supreme Judicial Council to overcome government gridlock over judicial appointments by requiring 7 out of the 10 members to approve appointing judges over the government’s objection.\n\nThe Lebanese Judges’ Association criticized the law on July 31, saying that it “reinforces sectarianism, renews political interference in the judiciary, and reaffirms the Supreme Judicial Council’s deprivation of any independence, administrative or financial.” The association accused the parliamentary committee of ignoring its recommendations and those from the Venice Commission.\n\nLebanese rights groups have previously criticized attempts by both the Administration and Justice Parliamentary Committee and the former justice minister to amend the draft in a manner that contravenes international standards.\n\nThe Venice Commission adopted separate opinions on the Draft Law on Independence and Transparency of the Judiciary in 2022, later renamed the Law Organizing the Ordinarily Judiciary, and a Draft Law on the Administrative Judiciary in 2024, providing the Lebanese government and parliament with recommendations intended to bring provisions regulating the judiciary in line with international standards.\n\nLebanon’s government should also advance further judicial reforms by working with parliament to remove civilians from the jurisdiction of Lebanon’s military courts.

Judicial reform has been a key demand by rights groups and legal experts to improve the country's justice system.\n\n**What happened** – On July 31, 2025, Lebanon’s parliament adopted a new law aimed at reforming the judiciary. The law introduces positive changes such as allowing judges to elect some members of the highest judicial body and giving judges more control over promotions and assignments. However, it also gives the government-appointed top public prosecutor power to stop ongoing legal cases and limits the judiciary’s ability to make appointments without government approval. The law is expected to take effect in January 2026.\n\n**Impact** – This law marks progress by increasing judicial self-governance and recognizing judges’ rights to freedom of expression and association. For example, judges can now nominate themselves for certain positions and have protections against being moved or suspended without cause. Yet, the law still allows political influence, especially through the top prosecutor’s powers and government control over key judicial appointments. This means the judiciary’s independence is only partially improved.\n\n**What's next step** – Human rights groups and legal experts urge the Lebanese government and parliament to revise the law to fully meet international standards, such as those advised by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission). Further reforms are also needed to remove civilians from military courts, which have been used to punish political activists. Continued pressure and legal changes are expected to strengthen judicial independence in Lebanon.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Lebanon’s new judicial reform law introduces important steps toward judicial independence but still leaves significant political influence that needs to be addressed.\n",

La loi introduit des changements positifs, comme permettre aux juges d'élire certains membres du plus haut organe judiciaire et donner aux juges plus de contrôle sur les promotions et les affectations.

Par exemple, les juges peuvent désormais se porter candidats à certains postes et sont protégés contre les déplacements ou suspensions sans raison. Pourtant, la loi permet toujours une influence politique, notamment par les pouvoirs du procureur général et le contrôle gouvernemental sur les nominations clés.

      "content": "The 104-year-old WW2 veteran who moved the Queen to tears\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Kavita Puri Presenter, The Second Map Share Save\n\nPA Media Yavar Abbas (left) shakes hands with Queen Camilla at the VJ Day 80th anniversary service\n\nWhen Capt Yavar Abbas stood on stage in front of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on Friday, he wasn't expecting to make headlines. He was at the official commemoration for the 80th anniversary of VJ - Victory over Japan - Day in Staffordshire as one of the last remaining veterans. Yavar was about to give a short address about his experience on the Asian front. But he decided to go off script. He told the audience he wished \"to salute my brave King who is here with his beloved Queen in spite of the fact that he's under treatment for cancer\". The King and Queen became visibly emotional. Yavar went on to tell the crowd he had been free of cancer too for the past 25 years, receiving a round of applause. Yavar is 104, and his journey to this moment, which he told to me when I met him earlier this year, is extraordinary.\n\nGetty Images\n\nHe was born in Charkhari, a state in British India, in what he describes as a \"one-horse town\". Officially his birth date is registered in 1921, but Yavar says he was born on 15 December 1920. He was a student when Britain declared war on Nazi Germany on behalf of India in 1939. From early December 1941, there was a new enemy and a new front. Japan had attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor. Hours later, Japanese forces targeted British colonies in South East Asia. And in just a few months, Japan had taken territory that had been part of the British Empire for more than a century, including Malaya (now Malaysia), Singapore and Burma (now Myanmar). By mid-1942 Yavar had to make an important decision - fight for the British or for Indian independence. He could not believe how quickly parts of the British Empire had fallen to Japan. There was a palpable fear that India could be next. \"I was not a supporter of British imperialism, in fact I detested it,\" Yavar tells me. At the time, there was a growing pro-independence movement calling for the British to \"Quit India,\" which was brutally suppressed. Yavar was aware fighting for the British would mean fighting a war in the name of freedom - while Indians were not free from colonial rule. But, like many Indian nationalists, he did not want Nazism and fascism to prevail. \"I had to choose and hope that if I joined the [British Indian] army, after the war, as they had been promising, I would get independence.\"\n\nYavar Abbas/Handout Yavar as a young man\n\nSo Yavar enlisted - and became one of around 2.5 million Indian soldiers to sign up. Initially he joined the 11th Sikh regiment and was posted to a \"God-forsaken place\" in a remote part of East Bengal, where he spent his days guarding a strategic site - and felt disappointed at the lack of action. Attitudes among the British officers frustrated him too. \"I found myself in a version of Dad's Army, in the company of white, middle-aged men as my fellow officers, who still considered India to be a crown colony on which they'll have continuing control for the foreseeable future.\" One day in the mess, Yavar spotted an advert in The Army Gazette for officers to be trained as combat cameramen. He applied and was soon accepted. In this role he joined the newly formed British 14th Army, whose aim was to win back territory lost to Japan. The troops of this army were well-trained for jungle warfare, and had better equipment. A multi-national force, in time it would number up to a million soldiers - mostly Indian, but also from other parts of the British Empire - including West and East Africa. This army felt completely different to Yavar: \"It was wonderful camaraderie. There were British and Indians mixing with each other.\"\n\nYavar would go on to film on the front lines at many major Allied-Japanese battles of the Burma campaign from 1944. He would travel in his jeep with an assistant, armed with a pistol and a Vinten film camera, a tripod, and many rolls of film. He sent his rushes to Calcutta (now Kolkata), along with dope sheets explaining what the shots were. There they were edited, and the film distributed for propaganda or newsreels. Yavar was at the siege of Imphal and the battle of Kohima when Japan invaded the strategic north-eastern Indian towns. Japan's aim was to cut off the Allied supply line to China. ​​Repelling Japanese forces at Imphal and Kohima was hugely significant, because success in taking these towns could allow Japan to progress deeper into India and expand its empire. These battles have been described by some historians as among the most significant of World War Two. British, Gurkha, Indian and African troops decisively halted the offensive into India. Tens of thousands of Japanese forces died. Many killed themselves rather than being taken prisoner in defeat.\n\nArchive Photos/Getty Images The objective of the 14th Army was to win back British territory lost to Japan\n\nYavar cannot forget the aftermath of the battles. \"It was a horrible sight, Japanese with swords sticking out of their bodies, instead of falling into enemy hands.\" The British advance to re-take Burma began afterwards. Yavar was around 30 miles (50km) from Mandalay when he had a brush with death. He tells me how the Japanese put up stiff resistance, and the Allies couldn't advance, so they took cover in shallow trenches. He was in one with a Gurkha unit, but continued to film. He thinks a sniper saw his camera and shot towards him. The Gurkha beside him was hit in the temple and died. Yavar's camera shattered. \"I'm lucky to be alive,\" he says. The Battle of Mandalay was a crucial one for the Allies. If they managed to take it, the road to the capital Rangoon (now Yangon), would be open to them. Yavar was in a tank, and decided he needed a better shot of the action. \"I just climbed up on top of the trunk and started filming.\" The turret opened and he was told by another officer to get down for his own safety. \"It was a stupid thing to do, but that's the kind of thing you do when you're young.\"\n\nKavita Puri Dope sheet describing footage from the battle at the Japanese stronghold of Fort Dufferin\n\nThe gun battle was intense and the aim was to capture the Japanese stronghold of Fort Dufferin. Yavar filmed the enemy positions being bombed relentlessly from the air. \"They kept on pounding them, pounding them, pounding them,\" he recalls. I went to the Imperial War Museum in London and found the footage that Yavar filmed that day. Even without sound, the raw, unedited, black and white images are as dramatic as Yavar described. I returned to his home to show him the footage which he had never seen.\n\n'We didn't achieve anything really': Yavar Abbas looks back at his own film\n\nAs he watched it, the events from 80 years all come back and he points at the screen as he remembers. \"That's my shot,\" he tells me as the British flag is raised in victory over the strategic Fort Dufferin. He shakes his head watching the images. \"It's bizarre to be sitting here and watching all that, and to think that I was in the middle of that.\" He says he cannot believe now that 80 years ago he was happy to shoot Japanese forces with his camera, as well as his gun. \"I'm not very proud of that,\" Yavar says, \"but that's how you feel when you are on the front.\" Yavar has something to show me, that he had found that morning. He takes out a faded notepad with loose leaves of paper that have yellowed with age. It's his diary from the front line. He had carried an ink pot with him in battle and written in the diary with his fountain pen. He reads out an entry from the day that Fort Dufferin fell on 20 March 1945. \"Thank goodness it is all over and that I'm still alive. I can still hear the noise of shelling not far away. Maybe it is the Japanese guns firing at the Fort. I'll find out tomorrow. Two o'clock in the morning now, and I must go to sleep.\"\n\nKavita Puri Yavar shows the entry from his diary on 20 March 1945, the day Fort Dufferin fell\n\nYavar wonders aloud how in the midst of battle he found time to sit and write this when he had to be up again at five in the morning. I ask him if he thinks he is brave. He looks at me as if that is a strange question. \"Absolutely not,\" he says. On VE Day, 8 May 1945 - when the war ended in Europe - Yavar was in Rangoon filming the recently re-taken capital. However, it was so inconsequential he didn't note it in his diary. Little had changed for him. The war against Japan was still ongoing. But then, completely unexpectedly months later, America dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan unconditionally surrendered on 15 August 1945, the day that VJ Day is marked each year. After the war, Yavar was posted with the 268 Indian Brigade as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces under the overall command of US Gen Douglas McArthur. He went to Hiroshima months after the bombing. Yavar says he saw the wasteland and people with horrific injuries. \"There were no buildings, it was just one tower that was left. Otherwise the whole thing was flat.\" It's the first time since we have spoken that Yavar's bearing changes - he has a look of horror as he remembers. \"It still haunts me,\" he says. \"I couldn't believe that human beings could do this to each other. Hiroshima was a terrible experience.\" The British did leave India, as Yavar had hoped. In August 1947, India was partitioned and two new states were born: Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Yavar was a witness to the bloody aftermath, and was heartbroken at the decision to divide India. Two years later, he came to Britain. He worked for many years at the BBC as a news cameraman travelling the world. He would go on to be an acclaimed independent film-maker, winning numerous awards.\n\nYavar Abbas Yavar worked as a BBC cameraman for many years",
