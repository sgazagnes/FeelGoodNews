      "summary": "In 2023, U.S. households, retailers, and restaurants wasted approximately 73.9 million tons of food—about 31%...\nThe post Taking Your First Bite of Upcycled Food: Understanding the Certification appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "In 2023, U.S. households, retailers, and restaurants wasted approximately 73.9 million tons of food—about 31% of the food supply, valued at over $382 billion —according to the nonprofit ReFED. That wasted food accounts for 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, nearly five times more than aviation. Now, a growing movement is transforming ingredients that would otherwise end up in landfills into safe, nutritious products you can find at your local grocery store.\n\nWelcome to the world of upcycled foods. Getting comfortable with this new food choice starts with understanding the certification system designed to help you identify food that would otherwise rot in landfills and fields.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links. If you make a purchase through these links, we will receive a small commission on the sale, which helps fund our work.\n\nWhat Is Upcycled Food?\n\nThe Upcycled Food Association (UFA), a nonprofit formed in 2019, developed the official definition: “Upcycled foods use ingredients that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, are procured and produced using verifiable supply chains, and have a positive impact on the environment.”\n\nIn practical terms, upcycled foods are made from ingredients such as surplus produce deemed too “ugly” for retail shelves, spent grains from brewing, fruit pulp left over from juice production, or imperfect produce that don’t meet aesthetic standards. Rather than being composted, fed to animals, or sent to landfills, these perfectly safe ingredients can get a second life in new food products.\n\nThe Upcycled Certified Mark: Your Guide at the Grocery Store\n\nToday, only one third-party certification exists globally for upcycled foods: Upcycled Certified, which is administered by Where Food Comes From, Inc., a leading food verification organization. The program launched in 2021 as the world’s first certification standard for upcycled food ingredients and products.\n\nThe certification has grown rapidly. As of 2024, 568 products were certified to the standard, a 17% increase from the previous year. Since the program’s inception, 806 products have achieved certification across 105 companies operating in 14 countries. These certified products have collectively diverted approximately 1.2 million tons of food waste, the equivalent of 248 million bags of groceries.\n\nWhat the Certification Requires\n\nA product that earns the Upcycled Certified mark meets rigorous standards that can give you the confidence to chow down.\n\nUpcycled Ingredient. To qualify as an upcycled ingredient in a product, such as flour made from spent grain or date sugar made from cosmetically imperfect dates, the ingredient must contain at least 95% upcycled content by weight, excluding added water. This applies to ingredients sold to manufacturers.\n\nTo qualify as an upcycled ingredient in a product, such as flour made from spent grain or date sugar made from cosmetically imperfect dates, the ingredient must contain at least 95% upcycled content by weight, excluding added water. This applies to ingredients sold to manufacturers. Products Containing Upcycled Ingredients. Finished retail products must contain at least 10% upcycled content by weight, again excluding added water, to qualify for the certification. For example, tortilla chips containing 40% upcycled corn germ from starch manufacturing would qualify.\n\nFinished retail products must contain at least 10% upcycled content by weight, again excluding added water, to qualify for the certification. For example, tortilla chips containing 40% upcycled corn germ from starch manufacturing would qualify. Minimal Content. Products containing less than 10% upcycled content by weight can use a “Minimal Content” mark, but don’t qualify for full “Upcycled Certified” status.\n\nProducts containing less than 10% upcycled content by weight can use a “Minimal Content” mark, but don’t qualify for full “Upcycled Certified” status. Supply Chain Verification. Companies must document that food waste is being diverted from a waste stream using bills of lading, invoices, waste records, or production records.\n\nCompanies must document that food waste is being diverted from a waste stream using bills of lading, invoices, waste records, or production records. Third-Party Audit. An Independent verification ensures that upcycled ingredients come from verified sources.\n\nThe certification covers more than food, applying to beverages, dietary supplements, pet food, cosmetics, personal care products, and household cleaners.\n\nIs Upcycled Food Safe?\n\nThis is often the first question shoppers ask, and the answer is, “Yes.” Upcycled foods must meet the same FDA food safety standards as any other food product sold in the United States. The ingredients were always safe to eat; they weren’t used for human consumption because of appearance, overproduction, or processing inefficiencies.\n\nThe Upcycled Certified standard requires that products “use ingredients that have full nutritional value and are safe, but for various reasons, would have gone to waste.” The certification program’s supply chain verification adds a layer of traceability that conventional products may not have.\n\nHow Does Quality Compare?\n\nUpcycled ingredients often deliver equal or superior nutrition compared to their conventional counterparts. For example:\n\nFruit and vegetable skins, which are often discarded during processing, contain concentrated fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants that add nutritional value.\n\nSpent brewing grains retain protein and fiber after the brewing process, and can be used in bread, pasta, pizza dough, and energy drinks.\n\nJuice pulp preserves the fiber often lost in conventional juice production.\n\nMany upcycled products position themselves alongside organic and premium products. Research published in Food Quality and Preference found that consumers perceive upcycled foods “to be more alike premium organic foods than conventional foods.” A SPINS retail study found that 51% of consumers are more likely to buy a product when it displays the Upcycled Certified mark.\n\nFinding Upcycled Products\n\nMajor Retailers Carrying Certified Products\n\nUpcycled Certified products have entered mainstream retail. You can find them at Target, Whole Foods Market, Walmart, Amazon, Misfits Market, and Kroger stores (through their private label partnership with Upcycled Foods, Inc.)\n\nUpcycled Food Products To Look For\n\nThe fastest-growing categories for upcycled certification include pet foods, snack foods, and beverages. Here’s where you’re most likely to find upcycled options:\n\nSnacks and Chips\n\nBaking and Ingredients\n\nSauces and Prepared Foods\n\nMatriark Foods pasta sauces from surplus tomatoes: matriarkfoods.com\n\nPet Products\n\nTap Into the Upcycled Foods Product Finder\n\nStart your research into upcycled foods by visiting the Where Food Comes From searchable database of Upcycled Certified products, including links to order or purchase as a local retailer.\n\nA World of Good Reasons to Try Upcycled Foods\n\nThe environmental case for upcycled foods is compelling. According to the UN, if food waste were a country, it would rank as the world’s third-largest emitter after China and the United States.\n\nThe certified products currently available have helped divert 1.2 million tons of food waste annually. The Upcycled Food Association’s certification program has prevented 840 million pounds of food waste annually.\n\nBeyond greenhouse gases, upcycling reduces pressure on land and water resources. 28% of agricultural land and 21% of freshwater go to producing food that ultimately gets wasted. Upcycling captures value from food that has already been produced, reducing the need for additional resources.\n\nIn 2021, Whole Foods Market first named upcycling among its top food trends and continues to emphasize it in its purchasing practices. Major retailers, including Kroger, have developed private-label upcycled products. The latest Upcycled Certified Standard, Version 3.0, provides an updated framework for the growing industry in response to consumer demand. With this kind of momentum, humanity can reduce its environmental impact and make the food we grow go further.\n\nTake your first step at the store; look for the Upcycled Certified mark. It tells you the product has been independently verified to contain ingredients that reduce food waste, meet safety standards, and offer a verifiable supply chain. Every purchase represents a vote for a food system that wastes less and values more.",

      "summary": "Long before agriculture, humans were transforming Europe’s wild landscapes. Advanced simulations show that hunting and fire use by Neanderthals and Mesolithic hunter-gatherers reshaped forests and grasslands in measurable ways. By reducing populations of giant herbivores, people indirectly altered how dense vegetation became. The findings challenge the idea that prehistoric Europe was an untouched natural world.",
      "content": "Picture Europe tens of thousands of years ago. Thick forests covered much of the land. Herds of elephants, bison, and aurochs roamed freely. Small bands of humans moved through this world carrying fire and spears.\n\nNew research suggests those early people changed their surroundings far more than scientists once believed.\n\nComputer Models Reveal Early Human Impact\n\nAn international team led in part by researchers at Aarhus University used advanced computer simulations to examine how climate, large animals, natural fires, and humans shaped European vegetation during two past warm periods. The team then compared those simulations with extensive fossil pollen data from the same eras. By matching the models with real world evidence preserved in pollen, they were able to estimate how much each factor influenced plant cover.\n\nThe results point to a clear conclusion. Both Neanderthals and later Mesolithic hunter-gatherers significantly altered vegetation patterns across Europe, long before agriculture began.\n\n\"The study paints a new picture of the past,\" says Jens-Christian Svenning, professor of biology at Aarhus University. The project involved experts in archaeology, geology, and ecology from The Netherlands, Denmark, France, and UK.\n\n\"It became clear to us that climate change, large herbivores and natural fires alone could not explain the pollen data results. Factoring humans into the equation -- and the effects of human-induced fires and hunting -- resulted in a much better match,\" says Jens-Christian Svenning.\n\nThe findings were recently published in PLOS One.\n\nHumans and the Decline of Megafauna\n\nThe researchers focused on two specific warm intervals in European history.\n\nThe first was the Last Interglacial period around 125,000-116,000 years ago, when Neanderthals were the only humans living in Europe. The second was the Early Holocene, 12,000-8,000 years ago, just after the last Ice Age, when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from our own species, Homo sapiens, inhabited the region.\n\nDuring the Last Interglacial, Europe supported a wide range of megafauna. Elephants and rhinoceroses lived alongside bison, aurochs, horses, and deer.\n\nBy the Mesolithic period, that picture had changed. Many of the largest animals had vanished or their numbers had dropped sharply. This reflected the broader wave of megafauna losses that followed the global spread of Homo sapiens.\n\nA New View of Prehistoric Europe\n\n\"Our simulations show that Mesolithic hunter-gatherers could have influenced up to 47% of the distribution of plant types. The Neanderthal effect was smaller, but still measurable -- approximately 6% for plant type distribution and 14% for vegetation openness,\" says Anastasia Nikulina.\n\nHuman influence showed up in two main ways. One was the use of fire, which burned trees and shrubs. The other was hunting large herbivores, a factor that has often been overlooked.\n\n\"The Neanderthals did not hold back from hunting and killing even giant elephants. And here we're talking about animals weighing up to 13 tonnes. Hunting also had a strong indirect effect: fewer grazing animals meant more overgrowth and thus more closed vegetation. However, the effect was limited, because the Neanderthals were so few that they did not do eliminate the large animals or their ecological role -- unlike Homo sapiens in later times,\" says Jens-Christian Svenning.\n\nAccording to Nikulina and Svenning, these findings challenge the idea that Europe was an untouched wilderness before farming began.\n\n\"The Neanderthals and the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers were active co-creators of Europe's ecosystems,\" says Jens-Christian Svenning. \"The study is consistent with both ethnographic studies of contemporary hunter-gatherers and archaeological finds, but goes a step further by documenting how extensive human influence may have been tens of thousands of years ago -- that is, before humans started farming the land,\" elaborates Anastasia Nikulina.\n\nAI Simulations and Interdisciplinary Research\n\nNikulina emphasizes that the project brought together multiple fields, including ecology, archaeology and palynology (knowledge about pollen). The team also developed detailed computer models to simulate ancient ecosystems.\n\n\"This is the first simulation to quantify how Neanderthals and Mesolithic hunter-gatherers may have shaped European landscapes. Our approach has two key strengths: it brings together an unusually large set of new spatial data spanning the whole continent over thousands of years, and it couples the simulation with an optimization algorithm from AI. That let us run a large number of scenarios and identify the most possible outcomes,\" says Anastasia Nikulina.\n\nSvenning adds that the modeling made one thing clear.\n\n\"The computer modeling made it clear to us that climate change, the large herbivores such as elephants, bison and deer, and natural wildfires alone cannot explain the changes seen in ancient pollen data. To understand the vegetation at that time, we must also take human impacts into account -- both direct and indirect. Even without fire, hunter-gatherers changed the landscape simply because their hunting of large animals made the vegetation denser,\" says Jens-Christian Svenning.\n\nEven with these advances, gaps remain in our knowledge about how early humans influenced their environments.\n\nNikulina and Svenning note that similar simulations could be applied to other regions and time periods. North and South America and Australia are especially intriguing because they were not inhabited by earlier hominin species before Homo sapiens. That makes it possible to compare more recent landscapes with and without human presence.\n\n\"And although the large models paint a broad picture, detailed local studies are absolutely essential to improve our understanding of the way humans shaped the landscape in prehistoric times,\" says Jens-Christian Svenning.",

      "summary": "Even when Earth was locked in its most extreme deep freeze, the planet’s climate may not have been as silent and still as once believed. New research from ancient Scottish rocks reveals that during Snowball Earth — when ice sheets reached the tropics and the planet resembled a giant snowball from space — climate rhythms similar to today’s seasons, solar cycles, and even El Niño–like patterns were still pulsing beneath the ice.",
      "content": "Researchers at the University of Southampton have found new evidence that Earth's climate did not completely grind to a halt during its most extreme ice age, a time often called Snowball Earth.\n\nThis dramatic chapter unfolded during the Cryogenian Period, between 720 and 635 million years ago. Scientists have long thought that during this interval, the planet's climate system essentially shut down.\n\nMassive ice sheets stretched all the way to the tropics, covering much of the globe in ice. From space, Earth may have looked like a giant snowball. Under these conditions, experts believed that exchanges between the atmosphere and oceans largely stopped, suppressing short term climate shifts for millions of years.\n\nA new study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters challenges that assumption. The research indicates that at least during one phase of Snowball Earth, the climate continued to fluctuate on yearly, decadal, and even century long timescales, with patterns resembling those seen in the modern climate system.\n\nScottish Varves Capture 57 Million Year Old Climate Record\n\nThe discovery is based on exceptionally well preserved layered rocks called varves on the Garvellach Islands off Scotland's west coast. These sediments formed during the Sturtian glaciation, the most intense Snowball Earth episode, which lasted about 57 million years.\n\nThomas Gernon, Professor of Earth and Planetary Science at Southampton and a co author of the study, said: \"These rocks preserve the full suite of climate rhythms we know from today -- annual seasons, solar cycles, and interannual oscillations -- all operating during a Snowball Earth. That's jaw dropping. It tells us the climate system has an innate tendency to oscillate, even under extreme conditions, if given the slightest opportunity.\"\n\nThe team closely analyzed 2,600 individual layers within the Port Askaig Formation. Each layer represents a single year of sediment buildup, offering a year by year archive of ancient climate conditions.\n\nLead author Dr. Chloe Griffin, Research Fellow in Earth Science at the University of Southampton, said: \"These rocks are extraordinary. They act like a natural data logger, recording year-by-year changes in climate during one of the coldest periods in Earth's history. Until now, we didn't know whether climate variability at these timescales could exist during Snowball Earth, because no one had found a record like this from within the glaciation itself.\"\n\nMicroscopic examination suggests the layers formed through seasonal freeze and thaw cycles in calm, deep waters beneath ice cover. When researchers applied statistical analysis to differences in layer thickness, they detected clear repeating patterns.\n\n\"We found clear evidence for repeating climate cycles operating every few years to decades,\" said Dr. Griffin. \"Some of these closely resemble modern climate patterns, such as El Niño-like oscillations and solar cycles.\"\n\nA Brief Pulse of Climate Activity in a Frozen World\n\nDespite these findings, the researchers do not believe such variability defined the entire Snowball Earth period.\n\n\"Our results suggest that this kind of climate variability was the exception, rather than the rule,\" explained Professor Gernon. \"The background state of Snowball Earth was extremely cold and stable. What we're seeing here is probably a short-lived disturbance, lasting thousands of years, against the backdrop of an otherwise deeply frozen planet.\"\n\nTo better understand how this could happen, the team ran climate simulations of a frozen Earth. The models showed that if the oceans were completely sealed beneath ice, most climate oscillations would be suppressed. However, if even a small portion of the ocean surface, roughly 15 per cent, remained ice free, interactions between the atmosphere and ocean could resume.\n\nDr. Minmin Fu, Lecturer in Climate Science at the University of Southampton, who led the modeling work, said: \"Our models showed that you don't need vast open oceans. Even limited areas of open water in the tropics can allow climate modes similar to those we see today to operate, producing the kinds of signals recorded in the rocks.\"\n\nThese results support the idea that Snowball Earth was not always entirely frozen. Instead, it may have been punctuated by intervals sometimes described as 'slushball' or more extensive 'waterbelt' states, when pockets of open ocean appeared.\n\nWhy Scotland's Rock Record Matters\n\nThe Garvellach Islands site was key to reconstructing this ancient climate story.\n\nDr. Elias Rugen, Research Fellow at Southampton who has worked on the Garvellach Islands for the past five years, said: \"These deposits are some of the best-preserved Snowball Earth rocks anywhere in the world. Through them, you're able to read the climate history of a frozen planet, in this case one year at a time.\"\n\nUnderstanding how Earth's climate behaved during Snowball Earth offers insights that extend far beyond this ancient era.\n\nProfessor Gernon said: \"This work helps us understand how resilient, and how sensitive, the climate system really is. It shows that even in the most extreme conditions Earth has ever seen, the system could be kicked into motion. That has profound implications for how planets respond to major disturbances, including our own in the future.\"\n\nThe study was supported by the WoodNext Foundation, a fund of a donor-advised fund program, whose support sustains Professor Gernon's research group at the University of Southampton.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – About 720 to 635 million years ago, Earth was in one of its coldest periods called Snowball Earth. Ice covered almost the whole planet, reaching the tropics, and scientists believed the climate was mostly frozen and unchanging.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of Southampton studied ancient layered rocks called varves from the Garvellach Islands in Scotland. These rocks formed during the coldest part of Snowball Earth and recorded year-by-year changes. The team found signs that the climate was still changing with cycles similar to today’s seasons, solar activity, and El Niño-like patterns, even under thick ice.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows that Earth’s climate system kept moving in small ways, even during extreme ice ages. It challenges the idea that everything stopped and suggests some parts of the ocean remained ice-free, allowing weather patterns to continue. This helps scientists better understand how Earth’s climate can stay active and respond to changes, even in very harsh conditions.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will continue studying these rocks and run climate models to learn more about how much open water existed and how climate cycles worked back then. This knowledge could improve our understanding of Earth's climate history and how planets react to extreme changes.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Even during the coldest Snowball Earth ice age, Earth's climate showed surprising activity, revealing a more dynamic frozen world than once thought.",

      "summary": "Rechargeable nickel-cadmium (NiCd) and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries are used in cordless phones, power tools,...\nThe post The Earth911 Rechargeable Battery Recycling Guide: NiCd and NiMH Batteries appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "Rechargeable nickel-cadmium (NiCd) and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries are used in cordless phones, power tools, electric toothbrushes, cordless vacuums, and many other household devices. Unlike single-use alkaline batteries, these rechargeable types have valuable materials inside. NiCd batteries also contain hazardous substances, so recycling them is not only smart but also required by law in many states.\n\nThe Battery Network (formerly known as Call2Recycle) reports that over 5.4 million pounds of rechargeable batteries were collected for recycling in the U.S. in 2023. Since 2001, The Home Depot has helped recycle more than 17 million pounds through this program.\n\nUnderstanding NiCd and NiMH Batteries\n\nNickel-Cadmium (NiCd) Batteries\n\nNiCd batteries, invented in 1899, were the first rechargeable batteries widely used in consumer devices. They are very durable, can last for up to 3,000 charge cycles, and work well in extreme temperatures and high-drain uses.\n\nVoltage: 1.2V per cell\n\nContains cadmium, a toxic heavy metal classified as hazardous waste\n\nSubject to “memory effect” if repeatedly partially discharged\n\nStill used in some power tools, emergency lighting, and industrial applications\n\nCadmium is highly toxic and can seriously harm the environment if NiCd batteries end up in landfills. When cadmium gets into soil and water, it builds up in the food chain and can harm people’s health, including raising the risk of cancer and kidney damage. Because of this danger, many states require NiCd battery recycling by law.\n\nNickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) Batteries\n\nNiMH batteries started to replace NiCd batteries for most consumer uses in the 1990s. They store more energy—about two to three times as much as NiCd batteries of the same size—do not contain toxic cadmium, and are available in standard AA and AAA sizes to directly replace alkaline batteries.\n\nVoltage: 1.2V per cell (compatible with devices designed for 1.5V alkaline)\n\nCycle life: Typically 500-2,000 cycles\n\nContains nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements\n\nNo memory effect (or minimal compared to NiCd)\n\nThey demonstrate a higher self-discharge rate than NiCd, though low-self-discharge versions like Eneloop have recently appeared.\n\nNiMH batteries are seen as more environmentally friendly than NiCd batteries because they do not have cadmium. Still, they contain nickel and rare-earth elements, so it is better to recycle them than throw them away. Most states do not consider them hazardous waste, except California, but recycling helps recover valuable materials and keeps soil and water safe.\n\nWhy Rechargeable Battery Recycling Works Economically\n\nRechargeable NiCd and NiMH batteries have materials that are worth money, unlike single-use alkaline batteries. This makes recycling them a good economic choice.\n\nBoth types of batteries contain a lot of nickel, which is valuable. Recycled nickel can be used to make things like stainless steel, cookware, golf clubs, or even new batteries.\n\nCadmium from NiCd batteries is toxic, but it is also useful in industry. It can be recovered at 99.95% purity and used in new NiCd batteries or other products.\n\nNiMH batteries have rare earth elements. Because they contain lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium in their hydrogen-absorbing alloy, NiMH batteries are becoming more valuable to recyclers, and successful collection means the industry can rely less on mining raw materials.\n\nThe steel in battery casings and parts can be recycled and used to make new metal products.\n\nThe Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act of 1996 (the Battery Act) requires manufacturers to provide easy ways for the public to recycle NiCd and small sealed lead-acid batteries. This legal mandate, combined with favorable economics, has created a robust recycling infrastructure.\n\nHow to Recycle Rechargeable Batteries\n\nIn the United States, recycling rechargeable batteries is free and easy because manufacturers fund these programs as required by law. More than half of the states have laws that require battery recycling or manufacturer support for collection programs.\n\nDrop-Off Locations\n\nThe Battery Network runs more than 20,000 collection sites across the country. Major retailers that take part include:\n\nThe Home Depot – accepts rechargeable batteries up to 11 pounds at Call2Recycle bins near store entrances\n\nLowe’s – battery recycling available at most locations\n\nBest Buy – accepts rechargeable batteries at customer service\n\nStaples and Office Depot – accepts batteries at most locations\n\nTarget – many locations have battery recycling bins\n\nWireless carrier stores (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, US Cellular)\n\nUse The Battery Network’s locator or Earth911’s recycling search to find the nearest drop-off location.\n\nMail-In Programs\n\nThe Battery Network Store offers pre-paid mail-in recycling boxes for consumers and businesses. You buy a box, fill it with used rechargeable batteries, and send it back with the prepaid label included.\n\nPower Tool Batteries\n\nYou can bring rechargeable battery packs from cordless power tools to any Call2Recycle drop-off location. TerraCycle also offers free recycling for Stanley Black & Decker brands, including DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, BLACK+DECKER, STANLEY, PORTER-CABLE, IRWIN, LENOX, MAC Tools, and Bostitch.\n\nWhat Happens to Recycled Batteries?\n\nAt recycling facilities, rechargeable batteries go through several steps. First, they are sorted by type, like NiCd, NiMH, or Li-ion, because each needs different processing. Then, a gas-fired thermal oxidizer removes things like plastics and insulation. The gases produced are captured and cleaned in scrubbers to stop pollution.\n\nAfter cleaning, the batteries are chopped into small pieces and heated until the metals melt. In NiCd batteries, cadmium is turned into vapor and condensed to reach 99.95% purity. Nickel and iron are recovered as alloys that can be used to make stainless steel. The recovered metals are then sent to refiners to be used in new products, including new batteries, helping to close the recycling loop.\n\nSafe Handling and Storage\n\nBatteries store a lot of energy, which can be a fire risk during recycling. The chemicals inside also need to be handled with care.\n\nTape terminals: Cover battery terminals with electrical tape or place each battery in a separate plastic bag to prevent shorts during storage and transport.\n\nStore in non-metal containers: Keep batteries in plastic or cardboard containers, not metal ones, which could cause a short circuit.\n\nKeep cool and dry: Store spent batteries at room temperature away from heat sources and moisture.\n\nDo not store batteries for too long. While it is safe to keep them for a few months, avoid letting large numbers pile up. Try to take them to drop-off locations regularly.\n\nNever put NiCd batteries in your curbside recycling or trash. Most states treat them as hazardous waste. Any rechargeable battery can cause fires if it is damaged by recycling equipment.\n\nState Requirements\n\nThe legal landscape for rechargeable battery recycling varies by state. More than half of U.S. states have laws requiring battery recycling or manufacturer-supported collection programs. Key regulations to know include:\n\nUnder federal law, NiCd batteries must be managed as Universal Waste, prohibiting disposal and requiring recycling. Florida, Minnesota, New Jersey, and several other states prohibit disposing of NiCd batteries in municipal solid waste.\n\nStates including California, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota require manufacturers to establish and fund collection programs.\n\nNew York requires retailers selling rechargeable batteries to accept used batteries for recycling.\n\nRecharging the Circular System\n\nRechargeable NiCd and NiMH batteries show how recycling can work well. Valuable materials, laws, and manufacturer-funded programs make recycling free and easy for everyone. This helps recover resources and keeps the environment safe. Use the many drop-off locations at major retailers, and never throw rechargeable batteries in the trash.",
