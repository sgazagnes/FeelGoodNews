      "title": "Scientists unlock the gene that lets bearded dragons switch sex",
      "summary": "Two independent research teams have unveiled near-complete reference genomes of the central bearded dragon, a reptile with the rare ability to change sex depending on both chromosomes and nest temperature. Using next-generation sequencing technologies from China and Australia, the projects uncovered the long-sought genetic basis of sex determination in this lizard.",
      "content": "August 19 marks the publication by two different studies presenting the near-complete reference genomes of the central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), a widely distributed species of dragon lizard common in central eastern Australia and popular as pets in Europe, Asia, and North America. This species has an unusual trait for an animal species: whether this lizard grows up to be a male or a female depends not only on genetics but also on the temperature of its nest. This has long made it a useful model to study the biological basis of sex determination, and the advent of huge technological improvements in genomics has finally found a region of the genome and a potential master sex determination gene likely central to male sexual differentiation. The independent verification of this by two different groups using two different approaches making this a much stronger finding.\n\nBearded dragons have an unusual sex determination system which is influenced by both genetics and environmental factors, specifically temperature. Unlike most animals where sex is solely determined by chromosomes, bearded dragons can have their sex reversed from male to female by high incubation temperatures. Meaning a lizard with male chromosomes can develop into a reproductively functional female if the egg is incubated at a warm enough temperature.\n\nLike birds and many reptiles, this species has a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system where females have a pair of dissimilar ZW chromosomes, and males have two similar ZZ chromosomes. Sex determination in this species is complicated further, as ZZ genotypic males can change to phenotypic females at high incubation temperatures without the help of W chromosome or W-linked genes. New ultra-long nanopore sequencing technology now allows us to generate telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies of the sex chromosomes and identify the non-recombining regions to help narrow the field of candidate sex determining genes in species with chromosomal sex determination. The ability of this technology to better separate out the maternal and paternal halves of the genome now allows much easier comparisons of the Z and W sequences to gauge potential loss or difference in function of key sex gene candidates.\n\nThe first paper from researchers from BGI, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Zhejiang University, uses DNBSEQ short-reads combined with long-reads from the new CycloneSEQ nanopore sequencer, this being the first animal genome published using this technology. Generation of the second genome was led by researchers from the University of Canberra with funding from Bioplatforms Australia, the Australian Research Council and PacBio Singapore, and with contributions to analyses from researchers of the Australian National University, Garvan Institute for Medical Research, University of New South Wales and CSIRO alongside Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB) in Spain. This assembly uses PacBio HiFi, ONT ultralong reads and Hi-C sequencing. Having reference genomes published using these two different technologies allows a like-for-like comparison between the ONT and CycloneSEQ technologies for the first time. Both technologies also complement each other by investigating the sex determination question using different approaches. The first genome sequenced a ZZ male central bearded dragon to characterize the whole Z sex chromosome for the first time while the second assembled the genome of a female ZW individual. The new nanopore sequencer also enabled the recovery of around 124 million base pairs of previously undescribed and missing sequences (nearly 7% of the genome), which included numerous genes and regulatory elements to better elucidate the complicated sex determination system.\n\nBoth projects assembled 1.75 Gbp genome assemblies of exceptionally high quality to assemble all but one of the telomeres, and only a few gaps remained mostly located in the microchromosomes. Using this data showed the Z and W specific sex chromosomes were assembled into single scaffolds, and a \"pseudo-autosomal region\" (PAR) where the sex chromosomes pair and recombine was also detected on chromosome 16. The sequencing of the male dragon by the BGI team looked for genes specific to Z but not the W chromosomes, and Amh and Amhr2 (the Anti-Müllerian hormone gene and its receptor) plus Bmpr1a were determined as strong candidates for the sex determining genes in this species. The sequencing of the female dragon by the Australian-led team pinpointed to the same candidate Sex Determination Region (SDR) of their dragon genome, and also highlighted Amh and Amhr2 as the likely candidate genes. Studying the expression in different developmental stages found Amh had significant male-biased expression patterns making it the most likely candidate as the master sex-determining gene. The differential expression of another sex-related gene Nr5a1 in the PAR suggests that the story may be more complicated, as Nr5a1 encodes a transcription factor with binding sites on the Amh promoter region. Unlike many fish that enlist Amh-like genes in sex determination, the autosomal copies of Amh and its receptor gene Amhr2 remain intact and functional. It could be that sex is determined by some form of caucus among genes on the sex chromosomes of the bearded dragon moderated by their residual autosomal copies.\n\nThe main highlight of these assemblies is therefore the discovery of genetic elements central to male sexual differentiation in vertebrates, on the sex chromosomes. The genes Amh and that coding its receptor AMHR2 have been copied to the Z chromosome in the non-recombining region, and so are obvious candidates for the master sex determining gene working via a dosage-based mechanism in this species, a discovery that has eluded discovery for so many years. No master sex determining gene akin to Sry in mammals or Dmrt1 in birds has to date been discovered in any reptile species. This new work provides a clear candidate in Amh, which is present in double dose in the ZZ male and single dose in the ZW female.\n\nArthur Georges from University of Canberra and senior author on the second paper says on the utility of this work: \"We anticipate accelerated research in other areas arising from these newly available assemblies, such as cranial development, brain development, behavioral studies, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in comparative studies of vertebrate sex determination and in many other areas looking for a well-supported squamate model against which to compare with their model species be it mouse, human or bird.\"\n\n\"I never cease to be amazed by the rapidity of progress of Chinese science. In relatively few years, BGI and its companion enterprises have developed sequencing technologies that deliver outcomes as good, and throughput and cost effectiveness that is better, than competing technologies on the market. These genome assemblies are testimony to that level of achievement.\"\n\nQiye Li from BGI and senior author on the first paper Lead author of the Chinese project explains their rationale for using this approach: \"We decided to start working on the bearded dragon genome last year as the first animal genome for this new sequencer because it was the Year of the Dragon in China. Benefiting from the unbiased long-reads provided by the CycloneSEQ sequencer, we readily obtained a highly contiguous genome assembly and resolved highly repetitive and high-GC regions that were traditionally challenging for assembly. The two reference genomes, derived from opposite sex and generated by different technologies, are indeed complementary to each other. I am excited that both genomes pinpoint the key role of AMH signaling in sex determination in this species. But how did the sex chromosomes arise? We anticipate that additional high-quality genomes from related species will further elucidate the evolutionary origin of the ZW system and complete the story.\"\n\nHaving two separate projects finding the same key candidate master genes independently of each other greatly increases the confidence in these findings. And openly sharing all of the data allows others to build upon this work, especially as the exact role of some of the other contributing transcription factors linked to sex determination are not yet fully resolved. The generation of these two new high quality genome assemblies however, is a massive step forward towards understanding the complete story of sex determination in this species.\n\nA webinar with the two lead authors is organized for August 26th at 10.00am UTC and provides an opportunity to ask them questions on this work.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Bearded dragons are special lizards found in Australia that can change their sex based on both their genes and the temperature of their nest. This is unusual because most animals’ sex is determined only by their chromosomes.\n\n**What happened** – Two separate research teams, one in China and one in Australia, used new, powerful DNA sequencing technologies to study the bearded dragon’s genome. They created very detailed maps of the dragon’s chromosomes and found a gene called Amh (Anti-Müllerian hormone) and its receptor Amhr2 that likely control whether the lizard develops as male or female. Both teams found the same gene independently, confirming the discovery.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time scientists have found a strong candidate gene for sex determination in reptiles like bearded dragons. It helps explain how temperature can override genetic sex and shows that the Amh gene plays a key role. Understanding this could help researchers learn more about how sex is determined in other animals too.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to study related lizard species to see how their sex chromosomes evolved. They also want to explore how the Amh gene and other factors work together to control sex. A public webinar with the lead researchers will allow people to ask questions and learn more about this discovery.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Two research teams have pinpointed a gene that helps bearded dragons switch sex, revealing how genetics and temperature together decide their sex.\n",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 20 August 2025; doi:10.1038/s41586-025-09386-0Screening by a graphite gate placed at 1 nm proximity to graphene produces transformative improvement in its electronic quality, reducing charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude.",
      "content": "Device fabrication\n\nThe devices were fabricated using the standard van der Waals assembly and electron-beam lithography, following procedures established in the literature without introducing critical modifications. Our detailed protocols are provided in Supplementary Information and summarized below.\n\nMonolayer graphene, hBN crystals (both 30–70 nm thick and 3–4 layers thin) and relatively thick graphite (5–50 nm) were mechanically exfoliated onto an oxidized Si wafer (290 or 70 nm SiO 2 ). Their thicknesses were determined using optical contrast, atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy (Supplementary Information). For most of the reference devices with remote graphite and Si gates, we assembled the exfoliated crystals using polymer-free flexible silicon nitride membranes17. For all proximity-gated devices and some reference devices, we employed polydimethylsiloxane stamps with polypropylene carbonate as a sacrificial layer. Although not critical, we found the latter method preferable for proximity-gated devices as it imposes fewer constraints (Supplementary Information).\n\nWe began the assembly of encapsulated graphene by picking up a selected top hBN crystal and then using it to sequentially collect graphene and bottom hBN crystals. Crucially for achieving ultrahigh electronic quality, the stacking process required the slow deposition of two-dimensional crystals onto each other, as this minimized the formation of bubbles and wrinkles and, consequently, allowed the sufficiently large final devices (Supplementary Fig. 1). All assembly procedures were conducted in air. Exfoliated flakes were either used within an hour or stored in a glovebox for assembly within 2–3 weeks. The completed trilayer stacks were transferred onto either a graphite crystal (for graphite-gated devices) or an oxidized Si wafer.\n\nFollowing the assembly, we used electron-beam lithography to define the top gate region and we deposited Cr–Au metallization by electron-beam evaporation. In the subsequent lithography step, we created electrical contacts by first exposing graphene edges using reactive-ion etching and then depositing Cr–Au to form one-dimensional contacts. The typical contact resistance was 2–5 kΩ µm at the neutrality point and decreased down to 0.1–0.3 kΩ µm at high doping. In the final step, we used the metallic top gate as an etching mask and defined multi-terminal Hall bars, as shown in the micrographs throughout the main text, Methods and Supplementary Information.\n\nAlthough some devices failed during fabrication (typically because of poor one-dimensional contacts), all successfully fabricated proximity-gated devices demonstrated consistently ultrahigh quality, with SdH oscillations always emerging below 4–5 mT and sometimes below 1 mT. The primary determinants of our device quality were interface cleanliness and careful, slow stacking (as described above and detailed in Supplementary Information).\n\nElectrical measurements\n\nMagnetotransport measurements were carried out in two cryogenic systems. A liquid-He cryostat with a variable temperature insert was used to study transport from 1.7 K up to room T. For measurements in the fractional QHE regime, we used a dilution refrigerator (Oxford Instruments) with T from 6 K down to 50 mK and magnetic fields up to 12 T.\n\nFor resistance measurements, we used the standard low-frequency lock-in technique at 30.5 Hz. Typically, the a.c. currents were between 1 and 5 nA, which allowed us to avoid heating and self-gating effects. Higher currents were required in magneto-focusing and bend-resistance experiments to achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratios: up to 1 µA for devices with remote gates and up to 0.1 µA for proximity-gated devices.\n\nTo control the carrier density n, we applied gate voltages using a Keithley Sourcemeter-2636B. For proximity-gated devices, in most cases we used only the top Au gate while keeping the bottom graphite or Si gate grounded. This approach prevented tunnelling through and possible breakdown of the few-layer hBN dielectric between the graphene and the proximity gate. However, for measurements of the fractional QHE, we found it advantageous to use the proximity gate to vary n. This strategy allowed us to avoid insulating QHE states inside the graphite gate (due to the 2.5-dimensional QHE in graphite36). Simultaneously, we applied a large bias to the bottom Si gate to suppress insulating states in regions of the graphene electrical leads that were not covered by the graphite gate.\n\nConverting gate voltages into carrier density\n\nFor devices with relatively thick gate dielectrics, the carrier density n in graphene exhibits a practically linear dependence on gate voltage V g because the geometric capacitance dominates (approximately 12 nF cm−2 for our Si-gated devices). The linearity holds because typical shifts in the chemical potential of graphene are small compared with eV g . However, the simple relation n ∝ V g breaks down notably in proximity-gated devices with their ultrathin dielectrics, as high-quality graphene exhibits a vanishingly small density of states near the neutrality point and in quantizing magnetic fields. This phenomenon is conventionally described in terms of quantum capacitance C q = e∂n/∂µ, which contributes in series with the geometric capacitance and consequently dominates if the density of states and, hence, C q become sufficiently small37,38. The resulting nonlinearities in the n(V g ) dependence become particularly pronounced in ultrahigh-quality graphene, as elucidated by Extended Data Fig. 1. Below we describe our methodology for converting the gate voltage into a carrier density.\n\nWe modelled our devices as parallel-plate capacitors with top and bottom gates biased at V t and V b (bottom panel of Extended Data Fig. 1a). The gates were separated from the graphene by hBN layers of thicknesses d b and d t . Applied voltages created electric fields E t and E b inside the top and bottom hBN dielectrics. V t shifted the electrostatic potential by d t E t and, therefore, changed the electrochemical potential of graphene µ(n), yielding the equation eV t = ed t E t + µ(n) where e denotes the absolute value of the electron charge. Similarly for the bottom gate, eV b = ed b E b + µ(n). The charge densities at the gate interfaces were n t = −εε 0 E t /e and n b = −εε 0 E b /e where ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity and ε ≈ 3.5 is the hBN dielectric constant. Charge conservation requires n t + n b + n = 0, which yields the following equation connecting n and µ with the gate voltages:\n\n$${V}_{{\\rm{b}}}+\\frac{{d}_{{\\rm{b}}}}{{d}_{{\\rm{t}}}}{V}_{{\\rm{t}}}=\\frac{e{d}_{{\\rm{b}}}}{\\varepsilon {\\varepsilon }_{0}}n+\\left(1+\\frac{{d}_{{\\rm{b}}}}{{d}_{{\\rm{t}}}}\\right)\\frac{\\mu (n)}{e}$$ (1)\n\nThis equation is generally applicable to any double-gated field-effect device that uses a two-dimensional material as a conducting channel. In most of our measurements, we used only the top gate to vary n while keeping both graphene and the proximity (bottom) gate grounded (V b = 0). It is important to note that, according to the above equations, electric fields will still develop in the gate dielectrics, even when the graphene is electrically connected to one of the gates, provided the other gate shifts µ(n) from zero. Indeed, if V b = 0, we obtain E b = −µ(n)/ed b , which shows that, despite being grounded, the proximity gate with its ultrathin dielectric actively participates in the device electrostatics and, as E b ∝ 1/d b , strongly contributes to the nonlinear behaviour of n(V t ).\n\nThe electrochemical potential µ(n) in equation (1) can be calculated by numerically inverting the integral:\n\n$$n(\\mu )={\\int }_{0}^{\\infty }D(E)f(E,\\mu ,T)\\,{\\rm{d}}E,$$\n\nwhere f(E, µ, T) is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function. The density of states D(E) is modelled in graphene as\n\n$$D(E)=\\frac{4eB}{\\sqrt{2{\\rm{\\pi }}}h\\varGamma }\\sum _{i}\\exp \\left(-\\frac{{(E-{E}_{i})}^{2}}{2{\\varGamma }^{2}}\\right).$$\n\nThis equation is written for the general case of a finite magnetic field. Here, E i is the energy of the ith Landau level, and D(E) depends not only on energy E but also on magnetic field B and level broadening Γ due to both temperature and disorder37,38. We solved equation (1) numerically (using an energy cutoff of 0.5 eV in all computations). Examples for non-quantizing and quantizing fields are illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1a by black solid curves.\n\nExperimentally, we determined the carrier density n as a function of V t by measuring the Hall resistivity ρ xy (V t ) at zero V b and employing the standard expression n = B/eρ xy . The latter is valid only outside the mixed electron–hole regime near the neutrality point (see, for example, Extended Data Fig. 3a and ‘Charge inhomogeneity from Hall measurements’ in Methods), which resulted in gaps on our experimental curves for very low n ≲ δn (Extended Data Fig. 1a). For the known thicknesses d b and d t , we fitted our experimental data using the numerical model described above, with broadening Γ as the only fitting parameter. Extended Data Fig. 1a shows good agreement between the experimental n(V t ) dependences and the model, yielding Γ ≈ 0.25 meV. This shows that, for the presented device, the energy broadening was dominated primarily by T. Our model accurately described the experimental curves in both non-quantizing and quantizing fields (left and right panels, respectively). We applied these fitted dependences (using the Γ values determined for each device) to convert V t into n and present the experimental data for proximity-gated devices as a function of n for different B and T.\n\nWe assessed the accuracy of our conversion procedure by examining how well it describes the ρ xx peak positions on the Landau fan diagram measured over a wide range of V t and B (Extended Data Fig. 1b). For monolayer graphene in moderate B, these peaks should appear at filling factors ν = 0, ±4, ±8, ±12, … and follow the immutable relation B(ν) = nh/eν on the fan diagram. Using our model with the extracted Γ values, we calculated n(V t ) and used this to determine the B(V t ) dependences for different filling factors, as shown by dashed curves in Extended Data Fig. 1b. The excellent agreement between measured and predicted Landau-level positions confirms the accuracy of our procedure for converting gate voltages into carrier densities. Using the same procedure, we transformed the nonlinear fan diagrams obtained as functions of V t (such as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1b) into the standard fan diagrams where Landau levels appear as straight lines radiating from the origin, as required by theory (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6). These linear fan diagrams provide further confirmation of the accuracy of our approach.\n\nCharge inhomogeneity in the best remote-gated devices\n\nIn the main text, we compared our proximity-gated devices with reference devices that used remote graphite gates. Extended Data Fig. 2 provides further details about our best remote-gated device. Its zero-B resistivity ρ xx (n) near the neutrality point is shown for two representative T (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and replotted on a log–log scale so that we could evaluate the residual charge inhomogeneity δn (Extended Data Fig. 2b). With increasing T, the resistivity peak broadened because of thermally excited carriers. The extracted δn(T) is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2c. Above 150 K, the experimental data follow the expected parabolic dependence δn = n th (T)/2 ∝ T2 within our measurement accuracy, as discussed in the main text. Below 10 K, δn saturates because electron–hole puddles dominate the transport properties.\n\nCharge inhomogeneity from Hall measurements\n\nAn alternative way to evaluate the charge inhomogeneity δn is to use Hall measurements18. Extended Data Fig. 3a shows ρ xy (n) for one of our proximity-gated devices at two representative T. The density range between the extrema in ρ xy (n) marks the regime of mixed electron–hole transport where the Hall response no longer follows the standard single-carrier dependence ρ xy (n) = eB/n. The distance between the extrema is given by n th ≈ 2δn and provides another quantitative measure of charge inhomogeneity18. On increasing T from 10 to 40 K, the extrema moved apart and broadened. Extended Data Fig. 3b compares the extracted δn with that expected from thermal excitations at the neutrality point. Above 10 K, δn follows the parabolic dependence n th (T)/2 ∝ T2 (within measurement accuracy), matching the results from the broadening of the ρ xx (n) peak shown in Fig. 1c.\n\nMetal–insulator transition\n\nAt low T, our proximity-gated devices exhibited a highly resistive state at the neutrality point, which showed signatures of strong localization and quantum interference. Extended Data Fig. 4a is a plot of ρ xx (n) under zero B. There is a pronounced peak at the neutrality point, which reached approximately 100 kΩ at 0.5 K, that is, 5 times larger than expected for charge-neutral ballistic graphene in its minimum conductivity state39. This behaviour indicates a metal–insulator transition, probably of Anderson type, as previously observed in double-layer graphene heterostructures40. The resistivity overshoots the maximum metallic value39 of πh/4e2 ≈ 20 kΩ at n ≲ 108 cm−2. This corresponds to the Fermi wavelength λ F ≳ 3.5 µm, which becomes comparable to the device width W. In this regime, the number of electronic channels fitting W is reduced to less than 5, whereas the Fermi energy is only 10–15 K. Under these conditions, quantum confinement effects become significant and open energy gaps between quantized sub-bands, which can become comparable to k B T. The onset of spatial quantization could contribute to the observed insulating state, although Anderson-type localization is probably the dominant mechanism given the observed B and T dependences40. Away from the neutrality point, other ‘mesoscopic’ features appeared on the ρ xx (n) curves at subkelvin T (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Given the long λ F , these features can be attributed to interference (Fabry–Pérot) resonances caused by standing waves in our ballistic devices.\n\nTo elucidate the nature of the observed insulating state, we analysed the T dependence of resistivity at the neutrality point (ρ NP ). Extended Data Fig. 4c shows an example of the measured ρ NP (T). The same data are replotted in Arrhenius coordinates in Extended Data Fig. 4b. The complete evolution of ρ xx (n) with T is presented in Extended Data Fig. 4d. These plots rule out the presence of simple thermal activation over an energy gap at the Dirac point, which would manifest as a straight line in the Arrhenius plot. Instead, ρ NP (T) has two distinct regimes: (1) logarithmically increasing with decreasing T below 10 K (black dashed curve in Extended Data Fig. 4c) and (2) a 1/T dependence at higher temperatures (red curve). The 1/T behaviour can be understood as follows. The density of thermally excited electrons and holes at the Dirac point is given by n th ∝ T2 (Fig. 1c), whereas their effective masses m th ∝ T (refs. 18,25). Consequently, the observed dependence ρ NP ∝ 1/T implies a temperature-independent scattering time, τ = m th /(e2n th ρ NP ), consistent with the ballistic transport of Dirac fermions limited by edge scattering and τ ≈ W/v F , as discussed in the main text.\n\nThe magnetic field dependence provides further insight into the metal–insulator transition. Extended Data Fig. 4e shows ρ NP (B) at 2 K. The insulating state was suppressed by fields of approximately 1 mT, resulting in pronounced negative magnetoresistance. We attribute this suppression to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry for interfering electron trajectories, a mechanism analogous to the destruction of weak localization in normal metals and which is expected to play a role in strong (Anderson-type) localization18. On increasing T above 10 K, the magnetoresistance changed sign from negative to positive, as evident from comparing ρ NP (T) at 0 and 5 mT in Extended Data Fig. 4f. This positive magnetoresistance is characteristic of a charge-neutral Dirac plasma in the Boltzmann regime25. The sign change occurs at approximately 10 K, providing independent confirmation of the regime change from the insulating state to the ballistic Dirac plasma, which was inferred above from changes in the functional form of ρ NP (T) (Extended Data Fig. 4c). The negative magnetoresistance also rules out an excitonic gap at the Dirac point. If present, such a gap would be enhanced by the magnetic field due to stronger confinement and increased exciton binding energy, contrary to our observations.\n\nMagnetic focusing in reference devices\n\nExtended Data Fig. 5a,b presents magneto-focusing measurements for hBN-encapsulated graphene devices with a Si-wafer gate (approximately 350 nm below the graphene) and a graphite gate (approximately 70 nm below), which are analogous to the measurements in Fig. 2 for proximity-gated devices. The focusing peaks appear at the expected positions given by26,27 B(n,P) = 2ħ(πn)1/2P/eL where P is the peak number and L the distance between injector and collector (dashed curves in Extended Data Fig. 5a,b).\n\nWe define the ‘first appearance’ of magneto-focusing peaks as the carrier density n where the P = 1 peak becomes clearly distinguishable above a noisy or fluctuating background, typically exceeding it by a factor of over 2. Importantly, the peak grows very rapidly as a function of n, so that the exact threshold factor is relatively unimportant and, in our experience, led to variations of less than 30% in the estimated onset density. Using this criterion, the magneto-focusing peaks in Extended Data Fig. 5a,b first appeared at n ≈ 0.5 and approximately 0.1 × 1012 cm−2 for the devices with Si and remote graphite gates, respectively. For the measurement geometries shown in the figure insets with injector–collector separations L ≈ 19 and 22.5 μm, this yielded transport mobilities µ = (eℓ/ħ)(πn)−1/2 ≈ 2 and 7 × 106 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the mobilities extracted from the ρ xx (n) dependences of the devices at the same densities, which validates the criterion suggested for estimating transport mobilities from the appearance of the first peak in magneto-focusing measurements. Accordingly, we have used this criterion to estimate µ also in proximity-gated devices. The surprising accuracy of this rule-of-thumb criterion stems from the very rapid development of magneto-focusing signals with increasing n, which resembles the similarly simple criterion for estimating the quantum mobility as discussed in ‘Determination of quantum mobility’ in Methods.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 5c summarizes our findings for mobility in all three types of device. Remote graphite gates improve µ several fold compared to Si-gated devices (which explains why graphite gates have become common in the recent literature), whereas proximity screening provides another order-of-magnitude enhancement in electronic quality. Note that the achieved mobilities in Extended Data Fig. 5c have to be compared at different carrier densities because magnetic focusing became observable only at n that exceeded δn by 30–100 times, with δn varying significantly between device types.\n\nOnset of SdH oscillations\n\nWe studied seven graphene devices with proximity gates, and results for three of them with remnant δn < 108 cm−2 are presented below. Extended Data Fig. 6 shows their Landau fan diagrams near the neutrality point, along with horizontal cuts at several fields in the millitesla range. Quantization becomes clearly visible below 1, 2 and 3 mT for devices S2, S3 and S4, respectively, so that µ q exceeded 10, 5 and 3.3 × 106 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The quantum mobility in device S2 matched or exceeded that of device S1, as described in the main text. To ensure reliable identification of SdH oscillations, we considered them to emerge only if the resistivity minima at ν = ±2 became pronounced enough to rule out any possible quantum-interference features (main text and ‘Metal–insulator transition’ in Methods). This required fields notably higher than those needed for the criterion µ q B* ≈ 1, where SdH oscillations with amplitude less than exp(−π) ≈ 4% of total ρ xx appear at B* (‘Determination of quantum mobility’ in Methods). Accordingly, the above values provide only lower bounds for µ q .\n\nDetermination of quantum mobility\n\nAlthough the expression µ q B* ≈ 1 is widely adopted in the literature, to justify its use in our study, we performed a quantitative analysis of SdH oscillations. To avoid complications arising from the metal–insulator transition, QHE and interference resonances, the measurements were carried out on devices with remote graphite gates at an elevated T of 5 K. Under these conditions, the SdH oscillations exhibited clear sinusoidal behaviour, with their amplitude exponentially increasing with B (examples are shown in Extended Data Fig. 7a).\n\nTo analyse such curves, we applied the Lifshitz–Kosevich formula41\n\n$$\\Delta {\\rho }_{xx}(n,T,B)\\propto \\frac{2{{\\rm{\\pi }}}^{2}{k}_{{\\rm{B}}}T/\\hbar {\\omega }_{{\\rm{c}}}}{\\sinh (2{{\\rm{\\pi }}}^{2}{k}_{{\\rm{B}}}T/\\hbar {\\omega }_{{\\rm{c}}})}\\exp (-{\\rm{\\pi }}/{\\mu }_{{\\rm{q}}}B),$$\n\nwhere ω c is the cyclotron frequency. For each carrier density, we replotted the oscillatory part of the resistivity Δρ xx as a function of 1/B and fitted it using the Lifshitz–Kosevich expression, with µ q as the only fitting parameter (inset of Extended Data Fig. 7b). Extended Data Fig. 7b compares the quantum mobilities extracted from these fits with those obtained using the rule-of-thumb criterion µ q B* ≈ 1 with B* being the field at which SdH oscillations first become clearly discernible (empty diamonds in Extended Data Fig. 7a). Within our experimental accuracy (10–20%), the two methods yield identical values of µ q , validating our use of the simpler criterion.\n\nOnset of quantized Hall plateaux\n\nAlthough in our proximity-gated devices quantum Hall plateaux appeared in fields as small as several millitesla, we found that contact geometry, rather than disorder, limited QHE onset. Extended Data Fig. 8a shows the Hall resistivity ρ xy (n) at different magnetic fields. As B was increased, the peaks of ρ xy grew until they reached the quantized value of h/2e2 at 4–5 mT. At these fields, the cyclotron diameter D c was comparable to the width w of our voltage probes (for Dirac fermions at ν = ± 2, D c = 2ℓ B ≈ 1.6 µm/B(mT)1/2). Consequently, cyclotron orbits at lower B were reflected, preventing edge states from reaching the contact regions and, thus, destroying the quantization29.\n\nTo corroborate this geometric effect, we examined QHE onset in devices with different w. Extended Data Fig. 8b plots the onset field versus w (blue symbols). Hall plateaux developed systematically at lower B for wider contacts, following qualitatively the criterion D c ≲ w. This indicates that, in our proximity-gated devices, the onset of full quantization was still limited by the dimensions of the voltage probe rather than the homogeneity of graphene or mobility, and we expect the QHE in proximity-gated devices to fully develop in fields as low as 1 mT, if we use contacts wider than 2 μm.\n\nFractional QHE under proximity screening\n\nTo assess how the fractional QHE develops in our proximity-gated devices, we studied in detail its evolution with increasing B, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 9. No fractional states could be observed below 6 T. Their signatures at ν = 2/3 and 5/3 first appeared above 7 T and became more pronounced at higher fields (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Notably, no signatures of ν = 1/3 were observed in any of our devices, which we attribute to the large negative quantum capacitance, which increases the total capacitance near incompressible states and can lead to a complete collapse of visible gaps when measurements are performed as a function of gate voltage31.\n\nThe emergence of fractional states corresponds to the magnetic length ℓ B decreasing below 10 nm. This is consistent with the fact that ℓ B represents the spatial scale of electron–electron interactions responsible for the fractional QHE. This critical scale of 10 nm inferred from the emergence of fractional states at 7 T aligns well with the characteristic scale 2παd ≈ 10 nm at which proximity screening for d ≈ 1 nm becomes effective in suppressing electron–hole puddles, as discussed in the main text. The systematic appearance of fractional QHE states only when ℓ B < 10 nm confirms that proximity screening primarily affects long-range interactions while preserving the short-range ones essential for many-body phenomena in high magnetic fields.\n\nSources of disorder\n\nDespite considerable progress in improving the quality of graphene devices over the past decade, the primary sources of disorder limiting mobility and charge homogeneity in hBN-encapsulated graphene remain poorly understood. Our current experiments and the existing literature allow us to rule out several potential disorder sources. First, atomic-scale defects in the graphene itself or at graphene/hBN interfaces are unlikely to be the dominant scatterers. Scanning probe experiments would have revealed individual short-range defects that were clearly visible on the corresponding images42 and did not occur within areas as large as over 10 µm2. Graphene/hBN interfaces are known to be atomically clean and flat, with minimal interfacial contamination43 (except for bubbles and wrinkles, which, however, were absent in our devices; Supplementary Information). Second, charged impurities at the metal/hBN interface of the top gate also appear to play a minimal role. Further experiments demonstrated no significant improvement when using graphite for both top and bottom gates (placed at distances of more than 10 nm). The latter observation is in line with previous studies using double-gated devices with two graphite gates, which found that mobilities were comparable to those in our remote-graphite-gated devices. Furthermore, attempts to use other atomically flat metallic crystals as proximity gates (including Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +x and TaS 2 ) failed to yield high mobilities21, presumably due to charged impurities in contact with hBN at their surfaces. Third, elastic strain in graphene can generate electron–hole puddles, but our observations indicate this to be an improbable primary source of disorder. Indeed, strain-induced puddles cannot be suppressed by proximity gating, yet we observed a notable reduction in the charge inhomogeneity.\n\nBeyond edge scattering, which obviously dominates in our limited-width devices, charged impurities within hBN represent the most probable source of both residual disorder and charge inhomogeneity. The hBN crystals used in our devices (from the National Institute for Materials Science) contain impurities at concentrations of approximately 1015 cm−3, primarily carbon substituents (T. Taniguchi, private communication). In comparison, state-of-the-art GaAlAs heterostructures8,9 contain impurities at concentrations of less than 5 × 1013 cm−3. However, this comparison requires nuanced interpretation. Impurities in hBN typically lie deep within the bandgap and remain predominantly neutral, whereas impurities in GaAlAs heterostructures (such as Si used for doping) are mostly ionized. Nonetheless, it is plausible that a fraction of deep impurity states in hBN become charged, creating a background electrostatic potential in graphene. The observed effectiveness of proximity gating (particularly in suppressing charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude) strongly supports this interpretation. Proximity screening specifically targets long-range electrostatic disorder while having a minimal impact on short-range scattering mechanisms. Although this analysis provides useful insights, a definitive conclusion about the dominant source(s) of disorder in hBN-encapsulated graphene demands further systematic investigation. This will probably require larger devices, as the mobilities achieved in our proximity-gated devices have been limited by edge scattering due to their finite size.\n\nHelical quantum Hall transport\n\nAlthough proximity screening suppresses electron–electron interactions, it can enable quantum phases that are otherwise difficult to observe in remote-gate devices. A notable example is the helical quantum Hall phase in the zeroth Landau level, which arises if a spin-polarized ferromagnetic phase is stabilized either by very large in-plane magnetic fields (approximately 30 T)44 or by screening Coulomb interactions using high-ε substrates35. In standard graphene devices, the zeroth Landau level typically exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state, resulting in an insulating bulk and insulating edges. By contrast, the ferromagnetic phase leads to a quantum Hall topological insulator with an insulating bulk but conducting helical edge channels where the current propagation direction is locked to electron spin polarization35,44 (Extended Data Fig. 10a).\n\nTo test for helical edge transport in proximity-gated graphene, we measured the two-terminal conductance in different contact configurations under a perpendicular magnetic field. In our multi-terminal Hall bar geometry, each ohmic contact acts as an equilibration reservoir for counter-propagating edge states, and therefore, each edge section between two contacts represents an ideal helical quantum conductor with resistance h/e2. Considering conduction along both device edges, the two-terminal conductance can be written as G 2t = (e2/h)(N R −1 + N L −1), where N R and N L are the numbers of helical-conductor sections for the right and left edges, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 10a, right panel).\n\nExtended Data Fig. 10b shows the measured two-terminal conductance versus top gate voltage V t at B = 80 mT, a relatively small but sufficient field for suppressing the insulating state at the neutrality point (‘Metal–insulator transition’ in Methods). As expected, well-defined conductance plateaux appeared at 2e2/h and 6e2/h, corresponding to the filling factors ν = ±2 and ν = ±6, respectively. Additionally, a quantized plateau emerged at the neutrality point (V t = 0) with G 2t = e2/h, consistent with helical edge conduction and matching the expected value for our geometry with N L = N R = 2. Geometry-dependent measurements (Extended Data Fig. 10c–e) further support the presence of helical transport, as altering the number of contacts along the edges between the source and drain changed the conductance, as expected from the above formula. In all configurations, the observed conductance at the neutrality point showed quantized plateaux matching theoretical predictions.\n\nThese results demonstrate helical edge states in proximity-screened graphene at magnetic fields more than an order of magnitude lower than previously required (more than 1 T) using a high-ε substrate35. This highlights the potential of proximity-gated devices for accessing exotic quantum Hall phases at reduced magnetic fields by suppressing electron interactions.",

      "content": "Properties of molecules and materials and chemical synthesis pathways require a comprehensive understanding of their chemical bonds. A deeper understanding leads to greater control over properties and chemical reactions. Weakening and cleavage of chemical bonds are the first steps to forming new bonds. Controlling these basic processes of chemical reactions is essential for engineering new materials and fine-tuning their structural properties, a highly active area of research5,6,7,8. Electronegativity and atomic charge are cornerstone concepts for rationalizing trends in charge transfer, bond polarity, bond strength, reactivity and various chemical properties9. Yet, until now, there is no generally applicable experiment that determines partial charges in chemical compounds. Here we present ionic scattering factors (iSFAC) modelling, an experimental method to assign partial charges to the atoms in molecules. iSFAC modelling is based on crystal structure analysis with three-dimensional (3D) electron diffraction. It determines partial charges at an absolute scale for every atom of the molecular compound. Our results indicate that iSFAC modelling is available with generally the same crystal quality as used for conventional single crystal structure determination. This method empowers chemists to determine the partial charges of all atoms of a chemical compound in its chemical environment.\n\nThe chemical bond is not a fixed property but depends on and can be modified by its chemical surroundings, forming the basis for all chemical reactions that involve the breaking of existing bonds and the formation of new bonds. The distribution of electrons in molecules affects bond strengths and reactivity, enabling predictions and modifications of bond behaviour in various chemical environments. The characterization of chemical bonds through crystallographic methods has traditionally been limited to instances with extremely high-resolution data of exceptionally high quality, enabling multipole refinement and analysis of bond topologies by, for example, Bader’s quantum theory of atoms in molecules10,11,12. The required resolution and quality are rare, which limits the applicability of this analysis. X-ray diffraction is the primary technology for crystal structure analysis, contributing to more than 1.5 million structures in public databases, which continue to grow exponentially13,14,15. However, X-rays are relatively insensitive to fine electronic details. Unlike X-rays, electrons are charged particles and therefore interact with the charge distribution, that is, the electrostatic potential or Coulomb potential, of the crystal. Thus, electron diffraction provides intrinsic access to partial charges in molecular structures. In the case of radiation-hard materials, this possibility has been demonstrated with a technique called converged beam electron diffraction pioneered by Spence with the quantitative determination of the electrostatic potential of rock salt and germanium16,17,18. A recent study was published with five inorganic compounds—quartz, natrolite, borane, lutecium aluminium garnet and caesium lead bromide—based on κ refinement19. For macromolecules, qualitative discrimination between oxidation states of metals in enzymes was reported20,21.\n\nIn this study, we introduce a broadly applicable method for the experimental determination of partial charges, named iSFAC modelling against crystallographic electron diffraction data. Our method is universally applicable to all classes of chemicals. iSFAC modelling provides absolute values for the partial charge of each atom of the crystallographic structure (Fig. 1). We present the results for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, the amino acids tyrosine and histidine, as well as the inorganic structure of ZSM-5. For all three organic compounds presented in this study—ciprofloxacin, tyrosine and histidine—the values show a strong Pearson correlation of 0.8 or higher with quantum chemical computations (Supplementary Tables 12–29).\n\nFig. 1: With iSFAC, the chemical environment in the crystal structure matters. The symbols ‘−’ and ‘+’ refer to negative and positive partial charge values of the respective atoms, respectively. Full size image\n\nWhen the crystal structure of a chemical compound is determined, each atom is typically described by nine parameters: its three coordinates x, y, z, and six parameters for its thermal vibration, the atomic displacement parameters. Each atom contributes to each reflection of the crystallographic diffraction experiment. The scattering factor, which describes the contribution of each chemical element, is usually hard-coded into the refinement software and not refined. The iSFAC modelling method presented in this study introduces one additional parameter for each atom. The scattering factor for each atom is a combination of the theoretical scattering factor of the neutral atom and the theoretical scattering factor of its ionic form. One parameter, which describes the fraction of the ionic scattering factor, equivalent to its charge, is refined along with the conventional nine parameters. This parameter balances the contribution of the ionic form with the contribution of the neutral form for the atom (see section ‘iSFAC modelling: quantification of partial charges’ for the technical details). As the scattering factors are based on the Mott–Bethe formula22, the resulting partial charges are on an absolute scale. There is one value for each individual atom in the structure, resulting in individual scattering factors for each atom (Fig. 2a,b). A welcome consequence of iSFAC modelling is its marked improvement in fitting models to diffraction data. For instance, it consistently improves the fit of the chemical model with the observed reflection intensities (Extended Data Fig. 8), and it shows enhanced structural details, including the possibility to refine coordinates and ADP values of protons (see Extended Data Fig. 9a–f), which is rather associated with dynamical structure refinement23.\n\nFig. 2: Plot of atomic scattering factors f(s) compared with data resolution s (Å−1). a, iSFAC modelling refines individual scattering factors f(s) for each atom. This enables the extraction of partial charges for each atom. b, Conventional refinement assigns one scattering factor per element type. Full size image\n\nTo illustrate our results, we highlight the differences in the partial charge distribution between carboxylic acid groups and carboxylate groups in ciprofloxacin and two zwitterionic amino acids, respectively. According to classical theory, the proximity of the amino group, which formally takes over the proton by a free electron pair, leads to the formation of a zwitterion. Hence, there is an excess of negative charge on two oxygen atoms that delocalizes over the carbon atom, making its partial charge negative. Both amino acids include a carboxylate group. Consequently, the carbon atoms C9 (−0.19e) in tyrosine and C6 (−0.25e) in histidine carry a negative partial charge. This seems counterintuitive for chemists but plausible considering the delocalized electron of the COO– group. The crystal structure of ciprofloxacin includes a carboxylic acid group COOH. There is no delocalized electron, but a well-defined C18=O1 double bond and a C18–O3 single bond. Consequently, C18 carries a positive partial charge (+0.11e) (Figs. 3 and 4).\n\nFig. 3: Experimental partial charges for ciprofloxacin hydrochloride. The numbers in brackets denote the standard uncertainties of the last significant digit. For example, −0.50(3) for Cl1 means −0.50e ± 0.03e. Full size image\n\nFig. 4: Experimental partial charges for amino acids. a,b, Experimental partial charges for tyrosine (a) and histidine (b). Element types are grouped by colour boxes: oxygen (light red), nitrogen (blue), hydrogen (pale yellow) and carbon (white). Full size image\n\nCiprofloxacin\n\nCiprofloxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone, exhibits marked antimicrobial activity and favourable pharmacokinetic properties24. In this study, the hydrochloride salt was crystallized in EtOH/MeCN, featuring a protonation NH 2 on the piperazine ring, and a carboxyl group (–COOH). The proton H3 of the carboxyl group forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the ketone group C14=O2. Figure 3 shows the molecule and atomic partial charges and highlights several results of the iSFAC modelling. As we would expect, all hydrogen atoms show positive charges. These partially positive charges balance the negative ones of nearly all non-hydrogen atoms, including the Cl− counterion. Only three carbon atoms exhibit a positive partial charge—namely, C18 as part of the carboxyl group, C14 with a double bond to O2 and C10 bonded to F1. The overall charge of NH 2 on the piperazine ring is positive, which makes a potent group to form a hydrogen bond with Cl− counterion. This explains the strong negative charge on the N2 atom.\n\nAmino acids\n\nThe amino acids histidine and tyrosine are frequently used in electron diffraction studies because of their notable radiation stability and availability, allowing for direct use from the bottle25,26. Figure 4 shows their experimental partial charges. Both histidine and tyrosine are zwitterionic structures, with positive and negative charges on their amine and carboxylate groups, respectively. This affects their chemical properties and interactions within crystal structures.\n\nTyrosine\n\nThe nitrogen atom N1 within the amine group carries a relatively high negative charge of −0.46e. This may seem surprising. Yet, N1 is associated with the protons H1A, H1B and H1C with positive partial charges of +0.39e, +0.32e and +0.19e, respectively. The amine group as a whole is thus positive and a potent proton donor, as seen in intermolecular N1–H1A⋯O3, N1–H1B⋯O2, and N1–H1C⋯O3 hydrogen bonds (Extended Data Fig. 9g). This distribution results in an electron-rich carboxylate group with a total negative charge of −0.80e. The oxygen atoms are more electronegative than the carbon atom, resulting in a greater negative charge on the oxygen atoms compared with the carbon atom (−0.29e and −0.21e for O1 and O3, respectively, compared with −0.16e for C9). As discussed above, the delocalized electrons result in the observation that the absolute value for the partial charge of C9 is negative. Moreover, the hydroxyl group (–OH) within the phenol group functions as both a hydrogen bond acceptor O2⋯H1B–N1 and donor O2–H2A⋯O1, with O2 bearing a charge of −0.27e and H2A bearing a charge of +0.29e.\n\nHistidine\n\nOur experimental data show that the N1 atom within the imidazole ring is neutral (+0.02e ± 0.04e). The O1 atom within the carboxylate group exhibits a strong negative charge of −0.31e, correlating well with tyrosine. This negative charge facilitates the formation of two intermolecular hydrogen bonds N3–H3A⋯O1 and N3–H3B⋯O1. By contrast, O2 exhibits a partial charge of −0.18e that is associated with the N1–H1⋯O2 hydrogen bond. This polymorph has the space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 . We also collected data from a different polymorph with space group P2 1 and a c-axis half the length of the first polymorph. The chemical environment in this polymorph is similar, but not identical. Consequently, the partial charges are similar, but not identical (Extended Data Fig. 2). This observation highlights the sensitivity of iSFAC modelling not only to the molecule itself but also to its chemical environment.\n\nA new role for hydrogen atoms in crystal structures\n\nUsually in crystallography, hydrogen atoms are treated differently than non-hydrogen atoms, because their contribution to the data is relatively weak. Their positions are calculated from the bonding geometry, and the ADP values are equal to the ADP value of the bonded heavier atom, multiplied by a fixed number (for example, the ADP value for the hydrogen atom in an N–H bond would be 1.2× the ADP value of the nitrogen atom). When this crystallographic habit is combined with iSFAC modelling, it renders the resulting partial charges of the non-hydrogen atoms meaningless. Including the charge of the proton is crucial in iSFAC modelling (see sections ‘Comparison with quantum-mechanical calculations’ and ‘iSFAC modelling: quantification of partial charges’). This treatment frees hydrogen atoms from their geometric constraints and enables their free refinement, similar to any non-hydrogen atom. When needed, for example, when data resolution is not quite atomic, mild restraints can be applied27. To explain the consequences of this emancipation of hydrogen atoms, we discuss the observation of two different configurations of the intermolecular N1–H1⋯O2 hydrogen bond revealed by iSFAC modelling: For histidine, the experimental partial charges O1 and O2 in the carboxylate group varied among different crystals (Supplementary Table 5). In dataset DS5, the strong negative charges on O2 (−0.24e) and N1 (−0.13e) are associated with an N1–H1⋯O2 angle of 175° ± 2°, an expected rather straight hydrogen bond. In crystal dataset DS1, with slightly positive charges on O2 (+0.10e) and N1 (+0.12e), the hydrogen bond angle is 155° ± 2° (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 6). We investigated these dimer configurations, characterized by an N1–H1⋯O2 hydrogen bond, with quantum-mechanical calculations. The analysis included four distinct configurations: two experimentally derived configurations from datasets DS1 and DS5; one configuration based on the conventional riding atom model (DS1_HFIX); and one configuration ‘OPT’ obtained after geometrical optimization with Gaussian16 (ref. 28). As shown in Fig. 5, the straight configuration with DS5 has a relative energy of 69 kcal mol−1 and is 59 kcal mol−1 more stable than DS1 with a relative energy of 128 kcal mol−1. The placement of H1 in the riding atom position increases the relative energy to 155 kcal mol−1, suggesting that the bending of H1 towards O2 in the N1–H1⋯O2 hydrogen bond configuration contributes to a more stable bond between the histidines in DS1. Although the optimized dimer OPT has the lowest energy, its two histidines differ from each other. The bottom histidine is a zwitterionic molecule. The protons H3A, H3B and H3C are bonded to the nitrogen, resulting in a positive charge of the NH 3 group compensated by the negative charge of the carboxylate group. By contrast, in the top histidine of the optimized structure, the hydrogen H3A has moved to the carboxyl group, yielding a non-zwitterionic configuration with an NH 2 and a COOH moiety, which is not observed in any of our crystal structures. This shows the depth of the insight that iSFAC modelling provides into the interaction between a molecule and its chemical environment.\n\nFig. 5: Comparison of computed energies for histidine conformations. Energy for four different possible configurations of the N1–H1⋯O2 hydrogen bond calculated with DFT. DS1 and DS5 are observed in the crystal structure of histidine. DS1_HFIX has H1 fixed at N1 in the riding atom position, and an optimized configuration of the dimer (opt). Full size image\n\nZeolite ZSM-5\n\nZeolite ZSM-5 was chosen to illustrate that iSFAC modelling also applies to inorganic compounds. Zeolites are aluminosilicate structures forming a great variety of different frameworks29. Zeolite ZSM-5 has an MFI-type framework in space group Pnma and is composed of 12 independent T-sites and 26 oxygen atoms. The unit cell is composed of (T 12 O 24 ) 8 because four oxygen atoms occupy special positions with half occupancy (Extended Data Fig. 4b). The T-sites are mainly occupied by SiIV and can be replaced with AlIII, creating a charge imbalance that affects their catalytic activity. Our experimental results reflect the expectations, in that the T-sites are expected to have a positive partial charge whereas the oxygen atoms are expected to be negatively charged (Fig. 6).\n\nFig. 6: Experimental partial charges for ZSM-5 across three different datasets (DS1, DS2 and DS3). The red bars represent negative charges, and the blue bars denote positive charges. Full size image\n\nRobustness and resolution dependence\n\nParameters derived from crystallographic modelling can vary with the resolution of the dataset—equivalent to the number of experimental data points—or they can depend on the quality of the crystals. Certain variations are expected with any experimental data, and iSFAC modelling is no exception. Figure 6 is an example, showing slight variations of partial charges between data sets of zeolite ZSM-5. Comparison of partial charges derived from a series of resolution cut-offs shows a systematic trend. At resolutions worse than 1 Å, deviations become visible as shown in Extended Data Fig. 3. This limit coincides with the limit known as Sheldrick’s rule30. The largest variations are accompanied by geometric irregularities, mainly for protons. Mild restraints to keep these atoms at their original positions recover the reliability of partial charge (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f).\n\nAs the charge information of scattering factors of ions is the greatest at low resolution (at s → 0 Å−1; Fig. 2), we need to ensure high data completeness at low resolution. In case the detector cannot capture the entire resolution range, the high-resolution pass should be followed by a low-resolution pass, as is common practice for good data collection31. This also applies to the temperature of data collection, as cryogenic temperatures generally improve data quality and protect better against radiation damage. In case of the zeolite ZSM-5, we collected data both at room temperature and at −110 °C. Except for the expected variation and reduction in estimated standard uncertainties, there is no notable trend for the partial charges (Extended Data Fig. 4a).\n\nAnother indicator for the stability of iSFAC refinement results from the computation of R complete (ref. 32), in which each reflection, in turn, is omitted from the refinement (leave-one-out cross-validation). In case of histidine, this results in monitoring the effect of each of its 1,710 data points on the values of the partial charges. Extended Data Fig. 3g shows ±3σ boxes about the mean value ⟨δq⟩ for each atom, as well as the respective maximum and minimum values. The ±3σ boxes are tiny, as the variance of the partial charge is minute. Next to it, Extended Data Fig. 3h shows the same type of analysis, not for the partial charge values but for the atomic displacement parameters U ij in case of a conventional refinement without iSFAC modelling. The spread of maximum and minimum outliers for U ij compares with those of the partial charge values, showing that missing certain reflections does not affect the reliability of iSFAC modelling beyond a standard crystallographic refinement.\n\nFor electron diffraction data, the dynamical theory of diffraction produces significantly more accurate calculated intensity values than the kinematical theory of diffraction33, but only kinematical refinement is available with the program SHELXL, which was used for this study. The discrepancy between dynamical and kinematical refinement increases with sample thickness. Therefore, Extended Data Fig. 5 shows the partial charges of four individual histidine crystals with varying thickness. Although the absolute thickness of these crystals is unknown, the transparency to the underlying lacey carbon and the crystal thickness vary between these samples. Within the range of selected crystal size, the plot of partial charges in Extended Data Fig. 5a does not indicate systematic errors related to the crystal thickness. Instead, to reduce random errors, it is advisable to always merge data from several crystals34.\n\nReliance of iSFAC on electron diffraction over X-ray diffraction\n\nWe also tested whether iSFAC modelling would be suitable for X-ray data. We chose a very high-quality dataset of Ca2+ tartrate, as well as a published structure of l-histidine with high-quality data (CCDC ID KAGGEI; ref. 35). Although with electron diffraction data, iSFAC modelling converges quickly to stable values for the partial charge, iSFAC modelling against X-ray data does not converge, leaving non-zero shifts of the parameters even after thousands of cycles, with partial charges much greater than 1e, and negatively charged protons, neither of which is chemically plausible (Extended Data Fig. 6).\n\nComparison with quantum-mechanical calculations\n\nThe electrostatic characterization inherent to our iSFAC methodology aligns closely with the results derived from quantum-mechanical computations. A rigorous quantitative analysis can be achieved by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient36 for the experimental and computational partial charge distributions in the case of the amino acids and the ciprofloxacin. As the quantum-mechanical calculations may depend on the functional and basis set, several combinations have been tested (see section ‘Computational approaches to determine partial charges’). On average, the various experimental datasets and the partial charges from the methods ADCH, CM5 and Natural Population Analysis (NPA), exhibit Pearson coefficients of 0.8 for ciprofloxacin, tyrosine and histidine—except for CM5 and NPA in the case of histidine. These high values underscore that our method for determining the partial charges coincides with quantum-mechanical calculations, consequently proving the validity of the iSFAC partial charges.\n\nNPA and both Hirshfeld variants, ADCH and CM5 (refs. 1,37), determine the partial charges of the atoms based on the electron density (see section ‘Computational approaches to determine partial charges’). As shown in Extended Data Fig. 1d for histidine, the high Pearson coefficients extend to most electron-density-based approaches (left group, methods Mulliken to Becke, labelled ‘Electron Density’), with the exceptions of the atoms-in-molecule (AIM) method and the Becke approach. The comparatively lower efficacy of the AIM method may stem from its dual dependency on wave functions and the partitioning of the molecule into discrete atomic volumes. Conversely, methods that derive partial charges based on the electrostatic potential (middle group in Extended Data Fig. 1d, methods MK, CHELPG and RESP, labelled ‘Electrostatic Potential’) exhibit moderate performance, with average Pearson coefficients around 0.5, which might be due to grid artefacts38. Particularly, at the polar surface of the molecules, grid-based approaches are more sensitive to the local environment than electron-density-based methods. Also, conformational changes may cause problems for grid-based charges1,39. Charges derived from the electronegativity scale, specifically the PEOE (partial equalization of orbital electronegativity) method, manifest the lowest Pearson coefficients. In Extended Data Fig. 1d, the green boxes refer to the above analysis with iSFAC modelling that includes hydrogen atoms, as expressed in equation (3). Notably, omitting special iSFAC treatment for protons results in Pearson correlation coefficients falling below 0.2 with any computational method (dark red boxes in Extended Data Fig. 1d), highlighting the indispensable role of protons in iSFAC modelling (see section ‘iSFAC modelling: quantification of partial charges’). This observation has led to the acknowledgement of the unique and important contributions of protons in iSFAC modelling. The poor performance of the partial charges without the inclusion of iSFAC treatment for hydrogens may be attributed to an imbalanced dataset, in which most of the non-hydrogen atoms exhibit negative charges. As a result, a linear regression focused solely on non-hydrogen partial charges is inherently more constrained compared with that which includes all partial charges. To address this hypothesis, the average charge of hydrogen atoms was calculated for the experimental partial charge sets not containing hydrogen atoms, effectively counterbalancing the charges of the non-hydrogen atoms. A Pearson correlation analysis was then re-conducted using an augmented dataset that included both hydrogen and non-hydrogen atoms, represented by the orange boxes in Extended Data Fig. 1d. Although incorporating the average hydrogen partial charges significantly improved the Pearson coefficients, the green boxes still demonstrated superior correlations, as indicated by higher average Pearson coefficients, reduced spreads of the corresponding boxes and lower standard deviations. The success of the average hydrogen partial charges (orange boxes) can be attributed to the relatively narrow range of hydrogen partial charges (0.1e ≤ q H ≤ 0.4e). Consequently, the actual partial charges of hydrogen atoms do not deviate substantially from the computed average for all protons. However, the partial charges of non-hydrogen atoms are considerably influenced by whether or not protons are included in the analysis. Specifically, the average Pearson coefficient of non-hydrogen partial charges between these two partial charge analyses is 0.63 in histidine, underscoring that the iSFAC model, which incorporates protons, not only improves the accuracy of hydrogen charges but also enhances the reliability of partial charges for all other atoms.\n\nPartial charges are the direct result of iSFAC modelling. Together with the phases computed from the crystallographic model, the Fourier transformation of the electron diffraction data produces a map that corresponds to the electrostatic potential map (ESP). Quantum chemical calculations calculate the electron density map first, and the partial charges are derived second (see section ‘Computational approaches to determine partial charges’). Extended Data Fig. 10 juxtaposes experimental with computed ESPs for tyrosine and histidine. Both for tyrosine (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b) and histidine (Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), the carboxylate group shows positive patches induced by hydrogen bonds. This is also reflected by the hydroxyl group of tyrosine. The respective protons are highlighted in Extended Data Fig. 10c,f. The strong match of the experimental ESP from iSFAC modelling with the computational ESP shows with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 69.0% for tyrosine and 71.4% for histidine. Extended Data Fig. 10c,f shows the pseudo-crystal environment used for the calculated ESPs.",

      "content": "Protein expression and purification\n\nIn Figs. 1–4 and 5d, we measured EYFP with the mutations S2insL/S65G/V68L/S72A/T203Y/H231L of avGFP, with an additional 6x His tag on the N-terminus (the full amino acid sequence is given at the end of this section). The protein was expressed using a pET vector constructed using HiFi assembly from Addgene plasmids 78466 and 29653. The resulting vector was sequenced to confirm the inclusion of the EYFP gene. The plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli for protein expression. Single colonies of the cells were picked from a kanamycin plate and incubated in 5 ml LB medium at 37 °C, 250 RPM overnight. Cultures were transferred into a 2-l flask with 500 ml LB medium and continued incubating at 37 °C. Once the optical density at 600 nm D 600 reached about 0.6, protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and the temperature was lowered to 30 °C. Cells were pelleted after 16 h and lysed using 4 ml B-PER (Thermo Scientific) per gram of cells. The supernatant pre- and post-lysis appeared yellow and was loaded onto a Ni-NTA spin column (Thermo Scientific) and washed 3 times using 10 ml solution containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 500 mM NaCl and 25 mM imidazole. Elution buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 500 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole) was used to elute the purified protein from the column. Buffer exchange using a 3-kDa molecular weight cut-off ultracentrifugal unit suspended the protein in the sample buffer (50 mM tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA). The protein solution was concentrated, estimated to be 6 mM by measuring the optical density of the samples at 515 nm, and stored at −80 °C. When measured at cryogenic temperatures, the protein solution was mixed with 20% v/v DMSO.\n\nThe following is the amino acid sequence of the EYFP we measured from E. coli: MGSSHHHHHHENLYFQSNIMLSKGEELFTGVVPILVELDGDVNGHKFSVSGEGEGDATYGKLTLKFICTTGKLPVPWPTLVTTFGYGLQCFARYPDHMKQHDFFKSAMPEGYVQERTIFFKDDGNYKTRAEVKFEGDTLVNRIELKGIDFKEDGNILGHKLEYNYNSHNVYIMADKQKNGIKVNFKIRHNIEDGSVQLADHYQQNTPIGDGPVLLPDNHYLSYQSALSKDPNEKRDHMVLLEFVTAAGITLGMDELYKSTGSG*.\n\nPreparation for ODMR of bacteria cells at room temperature\n\nEYFP was expressed in E. coli as discussed above. The E. coli were pelleted, the supernatant was replaced by sample buffer (50 mM tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA) and the pellet was stored at −20 °C. The sample was subsequently thawed at room temperature, loose cell debris and supernatant were discarded, and a sample of cells was scraped onto a 0.17-mm coverslip. The coverslip was placed on a printed circuit board and immediately measured using an oil immersion objective with 1.3 numerical aperture.\n\nEYFP expression in mammalian cells\n\nThe plasmid pNWA171 encodes a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD19. The vector and a gene fragment encoding EYFP (Twist Bioscience) were both digested with MulI and SbfI restriction enzymes and then ligated with T4 ligase. The resulting plasmid was sequenced to confirm the inclusion of the EYFP gene and the deletion of the CAR19 gene. The plasmid was maxi-prepped, transfected with the Lenti-X 293T cell line (Takara Bio) with PEI max (Polysciences), and then cultured for 48 h for EYFP production. On the day of the experiment, a coverslip with photolithographically patterned waveguides was sterilized using 70% isopropanol, washed extensively with PBS and then incubated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine (MilliporeSigma) solution for 5 min. The residual poly-lysine solution was washed extensively with PBS. Cells were dissociated from the culture flask with trypLE (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% HIFBS with a cell density of 1 × 107 cells per ml. Finally, the cell suspension was incubated on the coverslip under 37 °C, 5% CO 2 for 3 h. The coverslip was gently washed with PBS, allowing only the adherent cells to remain for the experiments in Fig. 5a–c. The cells were then imaged in PBS.\n\nThe following is the amino acid sequence of the EYFP expressed in mammalian cells: MLSKGEELFTGVVPILVELDGDVNGHKFSVSGEGEGDATYGKLTLKFICTTGKLPVPWPTLVTTFGYGLQCFARYPDHMKQHDFFKSAMPEGYVQERTIFFKDDGNYKTRAEVKFEGDTLVNRIELKGIDFKEDGNILGHKLEYNYNSHNVYIMADKQKNGIKVNFKIRHNIEDGSVQLADHYQQNTPIGDGPVLLPDNHYLSYQSALSKDPNEKRDHMVLLEFVTAAGITLGMDELYK*.\n\nExperimental methods\n\nExperiments were performed in a closed-cycle liquid-helium cryostat with temperature control from 4 K to room temperature using a custom confocal microscope (Extended Data Fig. 2). Prolonged exposure to laser excitation results in photobleaching of the EYFP (Extended Data Fig. 4c). To counteract photobleaching, the microscope was scanned over the area within a single photolithographically patterned loop structure, except for the low temperature Rabi (Fig. 3a) and room temperature data (Figs. 4 and 5d), where it was at a fixed location. Digital signals to pulse the lasers and microwave tones for driving the spin transitions were generated using the Real Digital RFSoC 4×2 running the QICK platform63 with a custom version of the software and firmware designed for optically addressable spin qubits. In Fig. 5, the wide-field fluorescence image was captured using a Leica DMi8 microscope.\n\nData analysis\n\nOADF photon counts were integrated over the first approximately 300 ns following the rising edge of the 912-nm laser pulse and over multiple experiments. The contrast in Figs. 1d, 2a,c, 3a and 4a,b, and Extended Data Figs. 7b, 8, and 12b,c are defined by the following normalization C = [PL sig (ω) − PL back (ω)]/PL back (ω), where PL sig (ω) refers to the photoluminescence with microwave output switched on and PL back (ω) refers to the photoluminescence with microwave output switched off. The contrast in Fig. 3b,c is defined as \\(C=\\frac{{\\rm{PL}}(\\theta =-{\\rm{\\pi }}/2)-{\\rm{PL}}(\\theta =+{\\rm{\\pi }}/2)}{{\\rm{PL}}(\\theta =-{\\rm{\\pi }}/2)+{\\rm{PL}}(\\theta =+{\\rm{\\pi }}/2)}\\) normalized to the fit maximum, where PL(θ) corresponds to the photoluminescence signal with the last microwave pulse having rotation angle θ. Finally, the contrast in Fig. 3d is defined as C = [PL(θ = π) − PL(θ = 0)]/PL(θ = 0). All stated errors are one standard deviation.\n\nSample degradation\n\nThe conformational stability of EYFP was interrogated using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The EYFP sample prepared at 100 μM in storage buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM EDTA; pH 7.4) was measured hours after purification and another sample of the same concentration was measured after cooling to 80 K in our cryostat at 5 mM concentration with 20% DMSO. Circular dichroism spectra between 180 nm and 260 nm at a scan speed of 100 nm min−1 and bandwidth of 5 nm were taken using a Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter. Extended Data Fig. 4a shows the resulting data after averaging over three scans. The spectra show a minimum at 230 nm, indicating that the main secondary structure content of EYFP is a β-sheet configuration. No substantial differences were observed between the spectra of the two samples, suggesting that the cool-down and warm-up processes used in the experiments did not alter the structure of EYFP.\n\nComputational methods\n\nThe orbital structures in Fig. 1c are the result of TDDFT64,65 calculations on the negatively charged model of the EYFP fluorophore terminated with methyl groups. The geometry was optimized using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model66 with a dielectric constant ε = 4 to mimic the protein environment. The ground-state geometry optimizations for the singlet (S0) and triplet (T1) states were performed using the Gaussian 1667 package at B3LYP/def2-TZVP level. The ORCA 5.4.0 package68 was used for the TDDFT calculations to compute the vertical excitation energies. Range-separated hybrid functionals CAM-B3LYP69 and ωB97X-D370 were used with the B3LYP/def2-TZVP/ε = 4 optimized geometries and def2-QZVPP basis sets for the TDDFT calculations. The zero-field splitting calculations for the D and E parameters were performed at the T1 optimized geometry with a series of functionals shown in Extended Data Fig. 6. The absolute D and E parameters were calculated using spin–orbit coupling treated at the spin–orbit mean-field theory (as implemented in ORCA 5.4.0 package). The coupled-perturbed method was used for calculating the zero-field splitting tensor with DFT71.\n\nTDDFT calculations\n\nTDDFT calculations predict the first bright singlet–singlet excitation to occur from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), showcasing a π → π* nature of the transition. This S0 → S1 transition corresponds to the experimental absorption at 2.54 eV. Both CAM-B3LYP and ωB97X-D3 predict an energy gap of about 3.02 eV between the S1 and S0 states. The results overestimate the experimental value, similar to an earlier report for gas-phase calculations72. The first bright excitation using the triplet optimized geometry occurs for T1 → T2, which also corresponds to a π → π* transition. Although this vertical excitation energy of 1.49 eV also overestimates the experimentally observed triplet–triplet absorption at 1.37 eV, it characterizes the T1 → T2 transition to involve a singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO), where the electron is excited from SOMO-2 to SOMO-1. The oscillator strengths and transition characters for all the transitions are reported in Supplementary Tables 1–4.\n\nSimulation of magnetic resonance spectrum\n\nSolving for the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian from equation (1) provides the T x –T z , T y –T z and T x –T y transition frequencies as a function of the magnetic field (B). Importantly the transition frequencies depend not only on the field strength but also on the molecule’s orientation relative to the magnetic field. Assuming that the EYFP molecules are randomly oriented, we sample 10,000 uniformly distributed orientations. To simulate the ODMR spectra in Fig. 2b,c, we incorporate the single-molecule ODMR linewidth (γ). The resonance for a single EYFP molecule is then modelled by a Lorentzian of the form \\(L(\\omega )=\\frac{{a}_{x-z}}{1+{\\left(\\frac{\\omega -{\\omega }_{x-{\\rm{z}}}}{\\gamma }\\right)}^{2}}+\\frac{{a}_{y-z}}{1+{\\left(\\frac{\\omega -{\\omega }_{y-z}}{\\gamma }\\right)}^{2}},\\) where a x−z and a y−z denote the ODMR contrast, and ω x–z and ω y–z denote the transition frequencies for the T x –T z and the T y –T z transitions, respectively. It is noted that our model simplifies the fitting by only considering the T x –T z and T y –T z resonance while omitting the T x –T y transition, which has a reduced ODMR contrast and experimental data that overlap with a harmonic of our signal generator. We iteratively optimize the fit parameters D, E, a x−z , a y−z and γ by minimizing the cost function \\(C={\\sum }_{i}{(n({\\omega }_{i})-L({\\omega }_{i}))}^{2}\\), where \\(n({\\omega }_{i})\\) denotes the experimentally observed ODMR spectra at the following fields: 2.1 mT, 4.5 mT, 6.1 mT, 8.2 mT and 10 mT. We find D = (2π) × (2.356 ± 0.004) GHz, E = (2π) × (0.458 ± 0.003) GHz, a x−z = (0.17 ± 0.02), a y−z = (0.129 ± 0.008) and γ = (2π) × (33 ± 4) MHz.\n\nRabi simulation\n\nWe computationally investigated the origin of the Rabi decay shown in Fig. 3a. Interestingly, we observed that the decay time increases with decreasing microwave power (Extended Data Fig. 7b) suggesting that loss in Rabi signal is not caused by dephasing. We simulated inhomogeneous broadening by sampling over a Gaussian distribution with a (2π) × 33 MHz standard deviation. The Rabi frequency depends on the molecule orientation with respect to the microwave drive field resulting in a fast decay that qualitatively captures our experimental observations (Extended Data Fig. 7c; a histogram of the Rabi frequencies is shown in the inset). In addition, the simulation captures the experimental behaviour that the decay time increases with decreasing microwave power (Extended Data Fig. 7d). We note that the inhomogeneous Rabi drive cannot be explained by spatial gradients caused by the loop geometry (Extended Data Fig. 7a).\n\nEstimation of number of measured molecules\n\nKnife-edge measurements of the 488-nm laser spot (Extended Data Fig. 9) estimate a beam waist w 0 = 2.81 μm (the larger between x, y) and Rayleigh range z R = 13.18 μm. We assume a Gaussian beam with intensity \\(I(r,z)={I}_{0}{\\left(\\frac{{w}_{0}}{w(z)}\\right)}^{2}{{\\rm{e}}}^{\\frac{-2{r}^{2}}{w{(z)}^{2}}}\\), where \\(w(z)={w}_{0}\\sqrt{1+{\\left(\\frac{z}{{z}_{{\\rm{R}}}}\\right)}^{2}}\\) and r is the radial distance, z is the distance from focus and I 0 is the maximum intensity. We also assume that the collection and 488-nm excitation beam have the same point spread function, resulting in a confocal volume \\(V={\\int }_{-\\infty }^{\\infty }{\\int }_{0}^{2{\\rm{\\pi }}}{\\int }_{0}^{\\infty }{\\left(\\frac{1}{{I}_{0}}I(r,z)\\right)}^{2}r\\,{\\rm{d}}r\\,{\\rm{d}}\\phi \\,{\\rm{d}}z={z}_{{\\rm{R}}}{({\\rm{\\pi }}{w}_{0})}^{2}/4\\). Using this volume and a sample concentration of 5 mM, we find that the effective number of molecules in our excitation volume is 773 × 106 molecules. We note that this estimate serves as an upper limit, as we collect into a single-mode fibre, but our imaging system is not diffraction limited due to poor alignment through the cryostat window and sapphire sample coverslip. With diffraction-limited imaging, we estimate that we would measure about 810-times-fewer molecules with approximately the same brightness, providing about 28-times-better sensitivity than in this work.\n\nSensitivity estimation\n\nThe minimum signal that can be detected when integrating for a duration T is given by S T /σ T = 1, where S T denotes the signal and σ T denotes the standard deviation of S T . In the following, the system’s response is linear with respect to a small field (δB) such that \\(\\frac{{\\rm{d}}{S}_{T}/{\\rm{d}}B\\times {\\delta }B}{{\\sigma }_{T}}=1\\). Therefore, the minimum field that can be detected is\n\n$${{\\delta }B}_{\\min }(T)=\\frac{{\\sigma }_{T}}{{\\rm{d}}{S}_{T}/{\\rm{d}}B}$$ (2)\n\nwhere \\(\\frac{{\\rm{d}}{S}_{T}}{{\\rm{d}}B}\\) is maximized. Assuming the measurement is shot-noise limited, the sensitivity is \\(\\eta ={{\\delta }B}_{\\min }\\sqrt{T}\\) (ref. 2).\n\nIt is noted that we report two sensitivities: first, the experimentally measured sensitivity for an ensemble of 773 × 106 molecules, which has units of T Hz−1/2. Second, we normalize the sensitivity to the total number of qubits measured in units of mol, which has units of T mol1/2 Hz−1/2.\n\nDC sensitivity (293 K)\n\nTo quantify the DC field sensitivity, we measure the difference of the photoluminescence at ω a = (2π) × 3.54 GHz and ω b = (2π) × 3.43 GHz, and normalize the signal to the photoluminescence in the absence of microwaves (PL back ). The resulting signal measured over T = 15 min is then given by C T = [PL sig (ω a ) − PL sig (ω b )/PL back ]. The fit has a slope of dS T /dB 0 = 5.0 T−1 and the residuals (Extended Data Fig. 10a) have a standard deviation σ T = 4.6 × 10−4 yielding a sensitivity of \\(\\eta =\\frac{{\\sigma }_{T}}{{\\rm{d}}{S}_{T}/{\\rm{d}}B}\\sqrt{T}=2.7\\,{\\rm{m}}{\\rm{T}}\\,{{\\rm{H}}{\\rm{z}}}^{-1/2}\\). Assuming an excitation volume of 256 μm3 and an EYFP concentration of 5 mM, which translates into 773 × 106 molecules, we find a room-temperature DC magnetic-field sensitivity of \\(2.7\\frac{{\\rm{mT}}}{\\sqrt{{\\rm{Hz}}}}\\sqrt{\\frac{773\\times {10}^{6}}{6.022\\times {10}^{23}\\frac{1}{{\\rm{mol}}}}}=98\\,{\\rm{pT}}\\,{{\\rm{mol}}}^{1/2}\\,{{\\rm{Hz}}}^{-1/2}\\).\n\nAC sensitivity (80 K)\n\nAC sensing of small fields can be done using the CPMG sequence shown in Extended Data Fig. 10b. The signal of a single CPMG sequence is then given by \\({S}_{\\pm }=\\frac{{n}_{\\Delta }}{2}(1\\pm \\sin (\\phi ))+\\frac{{n}_{\\Sigma }}{2}\\), where n Δ denotes the difference in photon count between the T x and T z state, n Σ their average, and the sign denotes the phase of the last π/2-pulse. Assuming a sinusoidal magnetic field with amplitude δB AC , frequency T CPMG /(2N) and in phase with the CPMG sequence, we can write the accumulated phase as \\(\\phi ={\\gamma }_{{\\rm{eff}}}\\delta {B}_{{\\rm{AC}}}{T}_{{\\rm{CPMG}}}W\\), with W = 2/π. The detected signal is then given by \\(S={S}_{+}-{S}_{-}={n}_{\\Delta }\\,\\sin (2{\\gamma }_{{\\rm{eff}}}\\delta {B}_{{\\rm{AC}}}{T}_{{\\rm{CPMG}}}/{\\rm{\\pi }})\\) and the sensitivity by \\(\\eta =\\frac{{\\rm{\\pi }}}{2({n}_{\\Delta }/{{\\sigma }}_{n}){|\\gamma }_{{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{f}}{\\rm{f}}}\\,|\\,{T}_{{\\rm{C}}{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{M}}{\\rm{G}}}}\\sqrt{2({T}_{{\\rm{C}}{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{M}}{\\rm{G}}}+{T}_{0})}\\), where σ n denotes the standard deviation of n Δ and T 0 is the experimental overhead time. The factor \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) originates from measuring n Δ with two CPMG sequences. To experimentally estimate the AC sensitivity of EYFP, we integrated the signal over 250,000 experiments. We fit the difference in photon counts n Δ,250,000 = 4,541 × exp(−(T CPMG /5.35 μs)2) as a function of T CPMG (Extended Data Fig. 10c) and σ n ,250,000 = 288 from the corresponding residual (Extended Data Fig. 10d). We can now estimate for a single experiment that \\({n}_{\\Delta }=\\frac{{n}_{\\Delta ,\\mathrm{250,000}}}{\\mathrm{250,000}}\\) and \\({{\\sigma }}_{n}=\\frac{{{\\sigma }}_{n,\\mathrm{250,000}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{250,000}}}\\). Under these conditions, we find T CPMG = 3.68 μs to be the optimal sensing duration (Extended Data Fig. 10e). Assuming an effective gyromagnetic ratio of \\({\\gamma }_{{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{f}}{\\rm{f}}}=(2{\\rm{\\pi }})\\times -7.63\\,{\\rm{G}}{\\rm{H}}{\\rm{z}}\\,{{\\rm{T}}}^{-1}\\) (that is, operating at B = 4.65 mT) and using T 0 = 60 μs, this results in a field sensitivity of η = 5.11 μT Hz−1/2. Given that we measured approximately 773 × 106 molecules, this translates into a sensitivity of \\(5.11\\frac{{\\rm{\\mu }}{\\rm{T}}}{\\sqrt{{\\rm{Hz}}}}\\sqrt{\\frac{773\\times {10}^{6}}{6.022\\times {10}^{23}\\frac{1}{{\\rm{mol}}}}}=183\\,{\\rm{fT}}\\,{{\\rm{mol}}}^{1/2}\\,{{\\rm{Hz}}}^{-1/2}\\).\n\nNMR sensing limit of detection\n\nIn this section, we consider a thought experiment where we calculate the sensitivity of an ensemble of N fusion proteins, each consisting of a EYFP protein conjugated to a target protein that contains a single 19F nuclear spin. This 19F nuclear spin is separated by 5 nm from the qubit and produces a local magnetic field of δB = 18 nT at the location of the fluorophore. The field strength δB is dominated by the target 19F spin in the fusion proteins, as other 19F spins are significantly farther away and do not contribute to the signal. Starting from the AC sensitivity calculation \\(\\eta =\\frac{{\\rm{\\pi }}}{2({n}_{\\Delta }/{{\\sigma }}_{n})\\,|\\,{\\gamma }_{{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{f}}{\\rm{f}}}\\,|\\,{T}_{{\\rm{C}}{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{M}}{\\rm{G}}}}\\sqrt{2({T}_{{\\rm{C}}{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{M}}{\\rm{G}}}+{T}_{0})}\\), we derive the limit of detection for NMR spectroscopy. However, in NMR only a small fraction of nuclear spins are polarized. Using the nuclear spin polarization (p), the overall signal is reduced to \\(S=p{n}_{\\Delta }\\,\\sin (2{\\gamma }_{{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{f}}{\\rm{f}}}\\delta {B}_{{\\rm{A}}{\\rm{C}}}{T}_{{\\rm{C}}{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{M}}{\\rm{G}}}/{\\rm{\\pi }})\\), resulting in a sensitivity of \\({\\eta }_{p}=\\frac{{\\rm{\\pi }}}{2(p{n}_{\\Delta }/{{\\sigma }}_{n})\\,|\\,{\\gamma }_{{\\rm{e}}{\\rm{f}}{\\rm{f}}}\\,|\\,{T}_{{\\rm{C}}{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{M}}{\\rm{G}}}}\\sqrt{2({T}_{{\\rm{C}}{\\rm{P}}{\\rm{M}}{\\rm{G}}}+{T}_{0})}=\\frac{1}{p}\\eta \\). This results in a polarization-adjusted sensitivity of \\({\\eta }_{p}=\\frac{1}{p}183\\,{\\rm{fT}}\\,{{\\rm{mol}}}^{1/2}\\,{{\\rm{Hz}}}^{-1/2}\\) (see main text), allowing us to detect a magnetic field of \\({\\delta }B=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}\\sqrt{T}}\\,{\\eta }_{p}\\). Solving for N we find a limit of detection of \\(N=\\frac{1}{T}{\\left({\\eta }_{p}\\frac{1}{{\\delta }B}\\right)}^{2}=\\frac{1}{T}\\frac{94}{p}\\,{\\rm{pmol}}\\,{{\\rm{Hz}}}^{-1}\\).\n\nImproved optical readout\n\nWe estimate the improvements that will be gained with future advances in the optical readout of EYFP. For comparison purposes, ref. 13 collected 0.02 photons from a single nitrogen-vacancy centre per experiment cycle. In Extended Data Fig. 10c, we measure 0.167 photons per experiment cycle from an ensemble of 773 × 106 EYFP molecules, which corresponds to 2.2 × 10−10 photons per molecule per experiment cycle. This means that in our experiment, we collect approximately 10−8-times-fewer photons from an EYFP molecule compared with a nitrogen-vacancy centre.\n\nOADF readout yields at most one photon per molecule per experiment cycle. This can, in principle, be improved by utilizing the cycling transition in the singlet manifold. Such a cycling could be accomplished by applying a short 912-nm pulse that transfers only the short-lived triplet states (T x,y ) into the singlet ground state but not the long-lived triplet state (T z ). The singlet population could then be probed by a subsequent 488-nm laser pulse. It is noted that this approach, relying on fluorescence cycling of the singlet state, would require an efficient triplet initialization since the population that remains in the singlet ground state after initialization would contribute a background signal to the readout.\n\nAlthough we have not yet quantified the shelving efficiency, it is probably low in the current experimental configuration. Improvements in shelving efficiency translate directly into gains in signal. Let us assume an ideal scenario where we achieve 100% shelving efficiency during the 488-nm initialization laser pulse. This implies that all molecules are in the T1 state following initialization and contribute to our sensing experiment. If the shelving efficiency increases from ζ 0 to 100%, then the number of probed molecules, and thus the photon number, also increases by 1/ζ 0 . The T1 triplet yield is approximately 0.003 (refs. 39,40), so by utilizing fluorescence readout, this would yield a signal amplification of 333 due to the improved cyclicity. Improved triplet shelving efficiency also allows for a much shorter initialization laser pulse. In saturation, the EYFP should shelve in approximately 333 × 3 ns = 1 μs. The readout laser pulse can also be shortened to about 1 μs. This yields an improvement of \\(\\frac{30\\,{\\rm{\\mu }}{\\rm{s}}+30\\,{\\rm{\\mu }}{\\rm{s}}}{1\\,{\\rm{\\mu }}{\\rm{s}}+1\\,{\\rm{\\mu }}{\\rm{s}}}=30\\). Use of an oil immersion objective with a modest numerical aperture of 1.3 would yield a (1.3/0.7)2 = 3.4 improvement in photon counts. As discussed in the section above, reduced aberrations would result in an 810-times improvement in signal.\n\nCombining all of these improvements yields an enhancement of \\(1/{\\zeta }_{0}\\times 2.75\\times {10}^{7}\\) signal photons, which should allow us to meet or exceed the sensitivity of a single nitrogen-vacancy centre.\n\nRoom temperature ODMR mechanism",
