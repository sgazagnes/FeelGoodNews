      "title": "Earth’s toughest microbes could help humans live on Mars",
      "summary": "Mars looks familiar from afar, but surviving there means creating a protective oasis in a hostile world. Instead of shipping construction materials from Earth, researchers are exploring how to use Martian soil as the raw ingredient. Two tough microbes could work together to bind dust into a concrete-like material and even help generate oxygen. The vision: 3D-print habitats using local resources, one experiment at a time.",
      "content": "Ever since humans first walked on the Moon, space agencies around the world have treated the idea of living beyond Earth as a major long term goal. Of the destinations we can realistically reach, Mars stands out as the leading candidate. Its dramatic terrain and a few familiar traits make it feel like the next frontier for exploration and settlement. Still, building a lasting human presence there remains one of our biggest ambitions and one of the hardest problems science and engineering have ever faced.\n\nMars was not always the way it is today. Over billions of years, the planet lost the thick atmosphere that once helped protect its surface. What remains is an environment that looks nothing like what most Earth life can tolerate. The air is extremely thin and mostly carbon dioxide, the pressure is under one percent of Earth's, and temperatures swing from about -90°C (-130°F) up to 26°C (79°F).\n\nOn top of that, there is constant cosmic radiation and no breathable air. That means a Mars shelter has to do far more than provide a roof and walls. It must function as a life supporting refuge that can withstand a world built to break down living systems. Shipping large amounts of construction material from Earth would be far too expensive and unrealistic. A practical approach is to build with what is already on Mars. In situ resource utilization (ISRU) means using local materials, and it is central to any plan for sustainable human life on the Red Planet.\n\nNASA's Perseverance rover has collected samples from Jezero Crater, an ancient Martian riverbed, and they may contain evidence of very early life. That possibility raises a bigger question that goes beyond searching for past biology. If microbes once lived on Mars, could microbial processes also help us build there?\n\nFrom Earth's earliest life to Martian construction\n\nLife on Earth began with simple microorganisms in shallow water environments. Over time, these tiny organisms reshaped the planet in enormous ways, including helping fill the atmosphere with oxygen and creating structures as durable as coral reefs. As we look toward Mars, researchers are asking whether small life forms could again play an outsized role, this time by helping turn a barren world into a place humans can survive.\n\nOur research takes inspiration from natural systems and brings together experts from multiple fields in an international cross disciplinary effort. The focus is biomineralization, a process where microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and microalgae) create minerals as part of their metabolism. Biomineralization has influenced Earth's landscapes for billions of years. Microorganisms that thrive in harsh settings such as acidic lakes, volcanic soils, and deep caves may be especially useful as we explore what could work under Martian conditions.\n\nTurning Martian regolith into a building material\n\nUsing rover data about Martian soil (regolith), our team is examining different microbial mineralization routes to see which ones can produce strong materials for habitats while avoiding interplanetary pollution risks. The most promising option so far is biocementation. In this approach, microorganisms produce cement like substances such as calcium carbonate at room temperature.\n\nA key part of the work centers on a partnership between two bacteria. One is Sporosarcina pasteurii, which is known for creating calcium carbonate through ureolysis. The other is Chroococcidiopsis, a tough cyanobacterium that can survive extreme environments, including simulated Martian conditions.\n\nTogether, they function as a cooperative system. Chroococcidiopsis releases oxygen, helping create a more supportive microenvironment for Sporosarcina pasteurii. It also produces an extracellular polymeric substance that can protect Sporosarcina pasteurii from damaging UV radiation on the Martian surface. In return, Sporosarcina secretes natural polymers that support mineral formation and help bind regolith. The result is that loose soil can be transformed into a solid, concrete like material.\n\n3D printing habitats and supporting life systems\n\nThe long term vision is to combine this bacterial co culture with Martian regolith and use it as feedstock for 3D printing on Mars. This concept sits at the meeting point of astrobiology, geochemistry, material science, construction engineering, and robotics. If it works at scale, it could change how structures are designed and manufactured for the Red Planet.\n\nThe potential value is not limited to construction. Because Chroococcidiopsis can produce oxygen, it could contribute to both habitat stability and astronaut life support. Over longer periods, ammonia created as a metabolic byproduct of Sporosarcina pasteurii could help enable closed loop agricultural systems and might even play a role in Mars's terraforming efforts.\n\nThe next hurdles on the path to Mars homes\n\nEven with promising ideas, the work is still at an early stage. International agencies aim to build the first human habitat on Mars in the 2040s, but recurring delays in Mars sample return limit how quickly Mars specific construction methods can be tested and confirmed. With space agencies planning crewed missions in the coming decade, research on bio derived construction needs to move forward now to be ready when humans arrive.\n\nFrom an astrobiology standpoint, a major task is understanding how these microbial communities behave in Martian regolith and how they endure the planet's many stresses. Regolith simulants in laboratories provide a practical way to test co cultures in Mars like conditions and to build models that predict how well biocementation will perform.\n\nRobotics adds another challenge. It is difficult to reproduce Martian gravity on Earth, yet gravity affects 3D printing and autonomous construction. To prepare for future missions, we need strong control algorithms and specialized protocols that let robotic systems build efficiently and reliably in Mars's unusual environment. Progress may be incremental, but every experiment, successful test, and refined procedure moves us closer to a future where humans can truly call Mars home.",

      "content": "Using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have spotted two rare kinds of dust in the dwarf galaxy Sextans A, one of the most chemically primitive galaxies near the Milky Way. The finding of metallic iron dust and silicon carbide (SiC) produced by aging stars, along with tiny clumps of carbon-based molecules, shows that even when the universe had only a fraction of today’s heavy elements, stars and the interstellar medium could still forge solid dust grains. This research with Webb is reshaping ideas about how early galaxies evolved and developed the building blocks for planets, as NASA explores the secrets of the universe and our place in it.\n\nSextans A lies about 4 million light-years away and contains only 3 to 7 percent of the Sun’s metal content, or metallicity, the astrophysical term for elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Because the galaxy is so small, unlike other nearby galaxies, its gravitational pull is too weak to retain the heavy elements like iron and oxygen created by supernovae and aging stars.\n\nGalaxies like it resemble those that filled the early universe just after the big bang, when the universe was made of mostly hydrogen and helium, before stars had time to enrich space with ‘metals.’ Because it is relatively close, Sextans A gives astronomers a rare chance to study individual stars and interstellar clouds under conditions similar to those shortly after the big bang.\n\n“Sextans A is giving us a blueprint for the first dusty galaxies,” said Elizabeth Tarantino, postdoctoral researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute and lead author of the results in one of the two studies presented at a press conference at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix. “These results help us interpret the most distant galaxies imaged by Webb and understand what the universe was building with its earliest ingredients.”\n\nImage A: Sextans A PAHs Pull-out (NIRCam and MIRI Image)\n\nImages from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope of the dwarf galaxy Sextans A reveal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), large carbon-based molecules that can be a signifier of star formation. The inset at the top right zooms in on those PAHs, which are represented in green. Image: NASA, ESA, CSA, Elizabeth Tarantino (STScI), Martha Boyer (STScI), Julia Roman-Duval (STScI); Image Processing: Alyssa Pagan (STScI)\n\nForging dust without usual ingredients\n\nOne of those studies, published in the Astrophysical Journal, honed in on a half a dozen stars with the low-resolution spectrometer aboard Webb’s MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument). The data collected shows the chemical fingerprints of the bloated stars very late in their evolution, called asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Stars with masses between one and eight times that of the Sun pass through this phase.\n\n“One of these stars is on the high-mass end of the AGB range, and stars like this usually produce silicate dust. However, at such low metallicity, we expect these stars to be nearly dust-free,” said Martha Boyer, associate astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and lead author in that second companion study. “Instead, Webb revealed a star forging dust grains made almost entirely of iron. This is something we’ve never seen in stars that are analogs of stars in the early universe.”\n\nSilicates, the usual dust formed by oxygen-rich stars, require elements like silicon and magnesium that are almost nonexistent in Sextans A. It would be like trying to bake cookies in a kitchen without flour, sugar, and butter.\n\nA normal cosmic kitchen, like the Milky Way, has those crucial ingredients in the form of silicon, carbon, and iron. In a primitive kitchen, like Sextans A, where almost all of those ingredients are missing, you barely have any proverbial flour or sugar. Therefore, astronomers expected that without those key ingredients, stars in Sextans A couldn’t “bake” much dust at all.\n\nHowever, not only did they find dust, but Webb showed that one of these stars used an entirely different recipe than usual to make that dust.\n\nThe iron-only dust, as well as silicon carbide produced by the less massive AGB stars despite the galaxy’s low silicon abundance, proves that evolved stars can still build solid material even when the typical ingredients are missing.\n\n“Dust in the early universe may have looked very different from the silicate grains we see today,” Boyer said. “These iron grains absorb light efficiently but leave no sharp spectral fingerprints and can contribute to the large dust reservoirs seen in far-away galaxies detected by Webb.”\n\nImage B: Sextans A Context Image (Webb and KPNO)\n\nNASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s image of a portion of the nearby Sextans A galaxy is put into context using a ground-based image from the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory.

The discovery means Sextans A is now the lowest-metallicity galaxy ever found to contain PAHs.\n\nBut, unlike the broad, sweeping PAH emission seen in metal-rich galaxies, Webb revealed PAHs in tiny, dense pockets only a few light-years across.\n\n“Webb shows that PAHs can form and survive even in the most metal-starved galaxies, but only in small, protected islands of dense gas,” said Tarantino.\n\nThe clumps likely represent regions where dust shielding and gas density reach just high enough to allow PAHs to form and grow, solving a decades-long mystery about why PAHs seem to vanish in metal-poor galaxies.\n\nThe team has an approved Webb Cycle 4 program to use high-resolution spectroscopy to study the detailed chemistry of Sextans A’s PAH clumps further.\n\nImage C: Giant Star in Dwarf Galaxy Sextans A (Spectrum)\n\nThis graph shows a spectrum of an Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star in the Sextans A galaxy. It compares data collected by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope with models of mostly silicate-free dust and dust containing at least 5% silicates. Illustration: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Joseph Olmsted (STScI)\n\nConnecting two discoveries\n\nTogether, the results show that the early universe had more diverse dust production pathways than the more established and proven methods, like supernova explosions. Additionally, researchers now know there’s more dust than predicted at extremely low metallicities.\n\n“Every discovery in Sextans A reminds us that the early universe was more inventive than we imagined,” said Boyer. “Clearly stars found a way to make the building blocks of planets long before galaxies like our own existed.”\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is the world’s premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it.

      "summary": "For nearly three decades, the International Space Station has been the only destination in low Earth orbit, but that will change this year. Could it be the start of a thriving economy in space?",
      "content": "For nearly three decades, the International Space Station has been the only destination in low Earth orbit, but that will change this year. Could it be the start of a thriving economy in space?\n\nA digital rendering of Vast’s Haven-1 space station Vast\n\nThe space station industry is starting to take off. For decades, if you wanted to send an astronaut or experiment into orbit, the International Space Station (ISS) was the only option. But now, as NASA and its partners prepare to deorbit the ISS at the end of the decade, commercially owned stations are preparing to take over.\n\n“These have been in development for a number of years now, mostly in partnership with NASA, and 2026 is really going to be the start of hardware flying,” says Mary Guenther, head of space policy at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC. There have been privately developed modules attached to the ISS before, notably from the now-dissolved firm Bigelow Aerospace, but no stand-alone commercial space stations.\n\nIn the absence of the ISS, though, such stations will be called upon to fill the gap. “It’s time for NASA to go further and do things that we’ve never done before, while leaving the rest – in this case, space stations in low Earth orbit – to commercial capabilities,” says Guenther.\n\nIn 2026, two such enterprises plan to step up to the plate in the US. The first is start-up Vast, which intends to launch its Haven-1 station atop one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets as soon as May. Haven-1 is much smaller and simpler than the ISS, and it will rely on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule to supplement its life-support systems, but if all goes well, it will be the first ever private space station.\n\nWith the help of the Crew Dragon capsule, it is designed to support four crew members at a time for both space tourism – it is equipped with a photography dome and wi-fi – and relatively small microgravity experiments. It is intended as a test bed for the larger and more more ambitious Haven-2, which Vast executives have said they envision as a replacement for the ISS.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“I think everybody, Vast included, is driving towards 2030,” says Colin Smith at Vast. “The ISS is coming down at the end of 2030, so people are looking at their calendars going: ‘Uh-oh, it’s 2025, we should do something.’”\n\nThe other space station mission planned for 2026 comes from Sierra Space, which is also currently developing a space plane called Dream Chaser. Sierra Space has announced plans to launch a prototype version of its expandable space station module, the Large Integrated Flexible Environment, in 2026. Eventually, this module is planned to be part of the Orbital Reef space station project being spearheaded by Blue Origin and Sierra Space.\n\nThere is no doubt that the era of the commercial space station will be different from that of the ISS, if only because of the much higher number of potential players in the industry. “There’s the likelihood of having a bunch of different models of commercial space station, potentially serving different markets,” says Guenther. “I’ll be really excited to see how they differentiate from one another to attract business and how that competition between them will drive innovation. Hopefully iron will sharpen iron.”\n\nMany hope that private space stations will lower the cost of operating in orbit the same way that private launch providers have made it more affordable to get to space.\n\n“The ISS is the most expensive thing that humanity has ever built. It has just been a bonkers amount of money, and we are not going to attain a future with space commerce, space manufacturing, with people living and working in space, if it costs $150 billion to house seven people,” says Smith. “Our long-term goal is getting millions of people living and working in space, and everything else is working out the stepping stones we need to get to that point.”\n\nIt remains to be seen, of course, if there is enough demand in the market to support such a thriving economy in space: the prospect of swarms of unique, specialised space stations in orbit is exciting, but those will require customers beyond just NASA and other national space agencies. As the first of the new space stations begin to launch and open for business this year, it should become clear whether they will have staying power.\n\n“There are these seedlings of industries that will be ready to transition to those space stations, including pharmaceuticals and materials,” says Guenther. “It will be interesting to see which of these seedlings will blossom and grow.”",

      "title": "SETI watched a pulsar flicker for months and found space keeps shifting",
      "summary": "A distant pulsar’s radio signal flickers as it passes through space, much like stars twinkle in Earth’s atmosphere. By monitoring this effect for 10 months, researchers watched the pattern slowly evolve as gas, Earth, and the pulsar all moved. Those changes create minuscule delays in the signal, but measuring them helps keep pulsars incredibly precise. The findings also aid SETI scientists in spotting signals that truly come from beyond Earth.",
      "content": "For nearly a year, a research team led by the SETI Institute closely followed the pulsar PSR J0332+5434 (also called B0329+54). Their goal was to understand how the pulsar's radio signal appears to \"twinkle\" as it travels through clouds of gas on its way to Earth. Using the Allen Telescope Array (ATA), the scientists collected data across radio frequencies from 900 to 1956 MHz. Over time, they detected slow but pronounced changes in this twinkling behavior, known as scintillation.\n\nPulsars are the dense, rapidly spinning leftovers of massive stars that exploded long ago. As they rotate, they emit radio flashes at extremely steady intervals. Because of this remarkable regularity, astronomers can use powerful radio telescopes to measure the exact arrival times of these pulses and search for subtle patterns linked to phenomena such as low-frequency gravitational waves.\n\nAs the radio waves cross interstellar space, however, they do not travel unimpeded. Gas between stars scatters the signals, spreading them out and causing slight delays before they reach Earth. These shifts can be incredibly small, sometimes only tens of nanoseconds (a nanosecond is one-billionth of a second). Correcting for these tiny, ever-changing delays is essential for keeping pulsar timing as accurate as possible.\n\nHow Space Makes Pulsars \"Twinkle\"\n\nMuch like stars shimmer when seen through Earth's atmosphere, pulsar radio signals also flicker as they move through space. Clouds of electrons between the pulsar and Earth create patterns of brighter and dimmer signal strength across different radio frequencies. These patterns do not stay the same. They change as the pulsar, the intervening gas, and Earth all move relative to one another.\n\nThis shifting scintillation directly affects when each pulse arrives. Stronger twinkling corresponds to larger delays. By repeatedly observing a single bright, nearby pulsar, the researchers were able to watch these patterns evolve and translate them into precise timing corrections. Those corrections can then be applied to experiments that demand the highest possible accuracy.\n\nBenefits for Astronomy and the Search for Technosignatures\n\n\"Pulsars are wonderful tools that can teach us much about the universe and our own stellar neighborhood,\" said project leader Grayce Brown, a SETI Institute intern. \"Results like these help not just pulsar science, but other fields of astronomy as well, including SETI.\"\n\nAll radio signals that pass through interstellar space experience scintillation. For SETI researchers, understanding this effect is especially useful. Strong scintillation can help distinguish natural cosmic signals from radio interference created by human technology.\n\nLong-Term Observations Reveal Changing Patterns\n\nThe ATA study relied on a broad range of radio frequencies and many short observing sessions). Nearly every day for about 300 days, the team measured the scintillation bandwidth (the size of the bright spots in the twinkling pattern). They found that the strength of scintillation varied noticeably over periods lasting from days to several months. The data also pointed to an overall cycle lasting roughly 200 days.\n\nIn addition, the researchers introduced a new, more reliable way to estimate how scintillation changes with radio frequency. This approach took full advantage of the ATA's ability to observe across a wide bandwidth.\n\nWhy the Allen Telescope Array Matters\n\n\"The Allen Telescope Array is perfectly designed for studying pulsar scintillation due to its wide bandwidths and ability to commit to projects that need to run for long stretches of time,\" said Dr. Sofia Sheikh, co-author and Technosignature Research Scientist at the SETI Institute.\n\nBy following a pulsar's signal as it travels through space, these observations offer insight into the pulsar itself, Earth's motion, and the material in between. That knowledge helps scientists better separate ordinary radio interference from signals that could have an artificial origin.",
