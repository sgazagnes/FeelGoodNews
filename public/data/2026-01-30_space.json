The capsule’s successful return marks the first time a capsule protected entirely by Varda-made C-PICA has come back to Earth. Varda Space Industries/William Godward\n\nUsing cutting-edge material licensed from NASA, a protective heat shield manufactured in-house by Varda Space Industries for the first time enabled one of its capsules to blaze through Earth’s atmosphere on Thursday, marking a significant milestone for the agency and America’s space industry. The material, known as C-PICA (Conformal Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator), provides a stronger, less expensive, and more efficient thermal protection coating to capsules, allowing them – and their valuable contents – to return to Earth safely.\n\nVarda’s W-5 capsule launched to low Earth orbit on Nov. 28, 2025, making it the latest spacecraft from the company to carry science and technology experiments from industry and government agencies into orbit.\n\nHeat shields allow us to bring the benefits of work done in space, including medical research, technology development, and scientific discovery, down to Earth to improve our everyday lives. Greg Stover Associate Administrator (Acting), Space Technology Mission Directorate\n\n“Heat shields allow us to bring the benefits of work done in space, including medical research, technology development, and scientific discovery, down to Earth to improve our everyday lives,” said Greg Stover, associate administrator of NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate at Headquarters in Washington. “By licensing heat shield material to a commercial aerospace company, NASA is fostering their ability to manufacture it independently, helping make entry system materials more readily available across the space sector.”\n\nDeveloped at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley, C-PICA sets the standard for heat shields, reflecting the decades of expertise that NASA brings to designing, developing, and testing innovative thermal protection materials.\n\nThe transfer of NASA’s C-PICA to Varda’s has far-reaching benefits, as the company uses its W-series capsules as a platform to process pharmaceuticals and conduct other microgravity research.\n\nThis flight shows what’s possible when NASA and our commercial partners collaborate closely to invest in learning together. Danielle McCulloch NASA's Flight Opportunities Program Executive\n\n“This flight shows what’s possible when NASA and our commercial partners collaborate closely to invest in learning together,” said Danielle McCulloch, program executive of NASA’s Flight Opportunities program at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. “Not only does it advance the U.S. space industry, but it also takes other industries — like pharmaceuticals — to the next level, with benefits that ripple out across society.”\n\nThe successful return of Varda’s W-5 capsule is the latest step in a productive ongoing collaboration. NASA not only licensed the technology to Varda but also selected Varda to receive a 2023 Tipping Point award to begin C-PICA production and flight testing through the agency’s Flight Opportunities program. NASA also provided technical support as the company set up its own manufacturing processes and assisted with gathering flight data. This work belongs to the growing sector of in-space manufacturing that depends in part on effective heat shields to safely return products and experiments to Earth.\n\nA NASA Technology Transfer Success\n\nVarda was the first company to license NASA’s C-PICA heat shield material, which has since been licensed to several other companies. The patented technology is still available, and NASA is working with other commercial space companies interested in the material. By licensing the technology as well as transferring the manufacturing expertise, NASA is helping increase the availability of C-PICA across the space sector, opening the door to greater growth of in-space manufacturing.\n\nLearn more about this flight test: https://go.nasa.gov/446Lqg4\n\nBy Tara Kennon\n\nNASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center, Edwards, Ca.",

The colors indicate different types of land cover. NASA/JPL-Caltech This same Nov. 29, 2025, image from NISAR’s L-band SAR instrument features labels noting cities and geographic features of the Mississippi River Delta region. Colors indicate types of land cover, such as healthy forests (bright green), thinned tree populations (yellow-and-magenta hues), and tall crops (bright magenta). NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nA new image from the NISAR mission shows off the satellite’s ability to reveal details of Earth’s surfaces. The science team also released new sample data.\n\nA U.S.-Indian Earth satellite’s ability to see through clouds, revealing insights and characteristics of our planet’s surface, is on display in a colorful, newly released image showing the Mississippi River Delta region in southeastern Louisiana.\n\nCreated with data collected by the NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite in late fall, the image shows the cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, the Mississippi River, Lake Pontchartrain, and a diversity of wetlands, farmland, forests, and communities. It also highlights the key difference between radar, which scans surfaces with microwaves, and technologies that sense visible light: Optical imagery from other instruments taken the same day showed the region largely obscured by clouds.\n\nThis image comes as the NISAR project prepares to make thousands of mission data files available for download in late February. The mission also recently released a smaller set of sample files to help data users prepare to utilize the broader dataset.\n\nWhile the Earth-observing satellite went through checks to verify the health of all its systems after launching in July, the mission’s NASA science team — researchers and data scientists from a range of disciplines spread around the U.S. — pulled preliminary measurements from its L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument to generate maps such as this one that demonstrate the instrument’s capabilities.\n\nBuilt by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, the L-band radar employs microwaves that, due to their 9-inch (24-centimeter) wavelength, can pass uninterrupted through clouds and image the surface below clearly.\n\nWhat’s revealed\n\nCaptured Nov. 29, the image demonstrates how the L-band SAR can discern what type of land cover — low-lying vegetation, trees, and human structures — is present in each area. This capability is vital both for monitoring the gain and loss of forest and wetland ecosystems, as well as for tracking the progress of crops through growing seasons around the world.\n\nThe colors seen here represent varying types of cover, which tend to reflect microwaves back to the satellite differently. Portions of New Orleans appear green, a sign that the radar’s signals may be scattering from buildings that are oriented at different angles relative to the satellite’s orbit. Parts of the city appear magenta where streets that run parallel to the satellite’s flight track cause the signals to bounce strongly and brightly off buildings and back to the instrument.\n\nThe resolution of the image is fine enough to make clear, right of center, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway — twin bridges that, at nearly 24 miles (39 kilometers) in length, make up the world’s longest continuous bridge over water.\n\nThe bright green areas to the west of the Mississippi River, which snakes from Baton Rouge in the upper left to New Orleans in the lower right, are healthy forests. There, tree canopies and other vegetation caused NISAR’s microwaves to bounce in many directions before returning to the satellite. Meanwhile, the yellow-and-magenta-speckled hues of Maurepas Swamp, directly west of Lake Pontchartrain and the smaller Lake Maurepas, indicate that the tree populations in that wetland forest ecosystem have thinned.\n\nOn either bank of the Mississippi, the image shows parcels of varying shapes, sizes, and cover. Darker areas suggest fallow farm plots, while bright magenta indicates that tall plants, such as crops, may be present.\n\nThe data products created with NISAR’s L-band measurements will be downloadable at the website of the Alaska Satellite Facility Distributed Active Archive Center. The Fairbanks-based facility stores and distributes NASA’s SAR data.\n\nInsights from NISAR can protect communities by providing unique, actionable information to decision-makers in a diverse range of areas, including disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and agricultural management.\n\nMore about NISAR\n\nA joint mission developed by NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), NISAR launched on July 30 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India’s southeastern coast. Managed by Caltech, JPL leads the U.S. component of the project and provided the satellite’s L-band SAR and antenna reflector. ISRO provided NISAR’s spacecraft bus and its S-band SAR, which operates at a wavelength of 4 inches (10 centimeters.)\n\nThe NISAR satellite is the first to carry two SAR instruments at different wavelengths and will monitor Earth’s land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days, collecting data using the spacecraft’s giant drum-shaped reflector, which measures 39 feet (12 meters) wide — the largest radar antenna reflector NASA has ever sent into space.\n\nTo learn more about NISAR, visit:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/nisar/\n\nNews Media Contacts\n\nAndrew Wang / Andrew Good\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n\n626-379-6874 / 818-393-2433\n\nandrew.wang@jpl.nasa.gov / andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\n\n2026-007",

      "title": "OBSERVER: Security, competitiveness, and access to space discussed at the 18th European Space Conference",
      "summary": "OBSERVER: Security, competitiveness, and access to space discussed at the 18th European Space Conference\nsonia\nThu, 29/01/2026 - 16:31\n\nAs Europe approaches a decisive moment for its space ambitions, the 18th European Space Conference convened policymakers, industry leaders, and institutional stakeholders to reflect on the choices shaping the continent’s space ecosystem over the coming decade. Held in the wake of the CM25 ESA Ministerial Council in Bremen and ongoing negotiations on the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework, the conference highlighted how space has become integral to Europe’s security, competitiveness, and strategic autonomy. Across two days of discussion in Brussels, attention shifted from vision-setting towards delivery, with a focus on operational capabilities, industrial resilience, and governance frameworks needed to sustain Europe’s space systems in a rapidly evolving global context. In this Observer, we look at some highlights from the conference.\n\n\nThe European Space Conference is a platform to address the most pressing topics and challenges faced in the European space ecosystem. Credit: Business Bridge Europe.\n\n \nA turning point for Europe’s space policy\nThe European Space Conference took place on 27-28 January in Brussels, at a moment when several major decision-making processes are converging for Europe’s space sector. Negotiations on the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework, including the proposed European Competitiveness Fund, are unfolding alongside reflections on the future direction of the EU Space Programme and the implementation of commitments taken at the most recent ESA Ministerial Council. Together, these processes are defining not only funding levels, but also priorities, governance models, and the way in which Europe intends to position itself in space over the coming decade.\nDiscussions during the two-day conference reflected a shared understanding that space assets and services have become strategic infrastructure. Satellite navigation, Earth Observation, secure communications, and Space Situational Awareness increasingly support European policy objectives ranging from climate monitoring and disaster response to security, defence, and economic resilience. As a result, decisions taken in the coming years will have long-term implications for Europe’s autonomy both in space and from space. The challenge ahead is not in expanding Europe’s space capabilities, but ensuring that they remain reliable, interoperable, and resilient in an environment characterised by geopolitical uncertainty, technological competition, and growing demand for space-based services\n“We shall spend a lot of our attention strengthening European cooperation; not to allow our space sector to be fragmented, overlapping, and not as effective as we would like to build. That is where we shall need to cooperate very well and effectively with Member States which are also developing their own capabilities.”\n- European Commissioner for Defence and Space, Andrius Kubilius\n \nFrom ambition to operational delivery\nA recurring theme at the conference was the transition from strategic ambition to concrete delivery. This shift is already visible across the EU Space Programme and its components, where recent milestones have reinforced continuity and long-term operational delivery.\nIn a session dedicated to satellite navigation, discussions focused on the completion of the first generation of Galileo satellites, reflecting the system’s growing role in sustaining economic activity and public services worldwide. Attention was also given to preparations for the next phase of development, including the transition toward launches of Galileo Second Generation (G2G) satellites. Today, more than 4.5 billion GNSS-enabled devices are in use globally, illustrating the scale at which satellite navigation has become embedded in everyday life. The successful launch of new satellites and the rollout of Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) have strengthened the system’s performance and security. OSNMA adds a layer of spoofing detection to open navigation signals and, as part of the Galileo Open Service, makes this capability freely available to all users. In doing so, Galileo is currently the only global navigation satellite system providing this capability through a free and open service. In parallel, testing of the Public Regulated Service (PRS) by EU Member States is advancing towards operational status. Together with EGNOS, Galileo continues to provide best-in-class navigation services to billions of devices worldwide, supporting both civilian and institutional users. Galileo’s tenth year of service provision underlined the importance of continuity and long-term reliability.\n\n\nPanel session on the evolving needs and capabilities for EO. Credit: Business Bridge Europe.\n\n \nEarth Observation (EO) featured prominently as another area where delivery and continuity are crucial. Over the past 18 months, six Copernicus Sentinel satellites have been successfully launched, ensuring the sustained provision of high-quality EO data. These launches, combined with ongoing upgrades, reinforce Europe’s position as a leading global provider of Earth Observation data. At the same time, the operational maturity of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and WEkEO illustrates how data access and processing infrastructures have become as important as satellites themselves. Beyond civil applications, discussions also addressed the evolving geopolitical context. The proposed development of a European Earth Observation Governmental Service (EOGS) reflects the need for timely, secure information to support security and defence decision-making. This need has informed ongoing preparatory work, including early development activities led by ESA under the European Resilience from Space initiative, which focus on maturing technologies and architectures that could contribute to a future EOGS capability. These efforts are complemented by broader coordination with defence stakeholders to help clarify requirements for secure, dual-use Earth Observation services for institutional users.\n \nSpace, security, and Europe’s strategic autonomy\nSecurity-related discussions formed a strong thread across the first day, cutting across sessions on connectivity, infrastructure protection, and space situational awareness. Sessions were focused on continuity of services, risk management, and resilience in an increasingly congested and contested environment.\nSecure connectivity was one area where this approach was evident. Discussions on governmental satellite communications reflected progress towards operational readiness. With the recent launch of GOVSATCOM operations, all Member States have access to secure satellite communications for governmental and military use, delivered through infrastructure built and operated in Europe and remaining fully under EU control. This step was presented as enabling the transition from preparatory phases towards service delivery, complementing broader efforts to strengthen secure connectivity through initiatives such as IRIS², which is now focused on implementation following the signature of the concession contract with the SpaceRISE consortium.\nSpace situational awareness also featured prominently, particularly in the context of space traffic management. The expansion of the EU Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) partnership, growing coverage of satellites, and increasing uptake of services by non-EU users illustrate how European capabilities are evolving in response to congestion and risk in orbit. As EU SST approaches a decade of service provision, its role in safeguarding space assets is increasingly seen as foundational.\n \nCompetitiveness, access to space, and scaling Europe’s industry\nDiscussions on the second day placed renewed focus on access to space as an enabling condition for Europe’s space ecosystem. Competitiveness was addressed as a structural challenge spanning the entire space value chain in discussions that highlighted its relevance for Europe’s strategic autonomy and the reduction of critical dependencies. Ensuring access to space was highlighted as a key enabler of Europe’s space ambitions. Ensuring autonomous, reliable, and cost-effective launch capabilities for institutional and commercial users remains a central concern, particularly in the context of reducing external dependencies amid global market pressures.\nPolicy instruments aimed at strengthening Europe’s launch ecosystem were discussed as part of a broader strategy. Aggregation of institutional demand, market transparency, and support for innovation were recurring themes. These discussions were complemented by a dedicated award ceremony held during the conference, where the winners of the Game-changing Innovations for European Launch Solutions initiative were recognised. Five selected projects received €950,000 each, showing how targeted incentives are being used to support disruptive innovation and Europe’s future access to space. The next edition of the award is expected to feature a significantly expanded prize purse totalling €20 million.\n\n\nArianeGroup’s high strength oxygen-compatible alloy, V-Loy, as one of the five projects awarded. Credit: Business Bridge Europe.\n\n \nDiscussions on competitiveness also extended beyond launch. The European Competitiveness Fund and the Vision for the European Space Economy provided a backdrop for these exchanges. Panellists discussed how industrial resilience, production capacity, and scale-up pathways are becoming as relevant as technological innovation itself. Initiatives supporting start-ups and SMEs, including CASSINI, were referenced as tools to help bridge the gap between innovation and market maturity, particularly in a challenging economic environment.\n“Time is of the essence. We need to be able to pull together the national skills and constellations, European industry- big and small, the primes, and the newcomers in the best possible way.”\n-Director General for Defence Industry and Space, Timo Pesonen\n \nTechnology sovereignty, research, and acting in space\nThe final sessions of the conference looked towards the capabilities and frameworks needed to sustain Europe’s space ambitions over the long term. Panels underscored the importance of investing upstream to secure Europe’s future capabilities. Technology sovereignty emerged as a cross-cutting priority, closely tied to supply chain resilience and industrial autonomy.\nStrong participation in space-related calls under Horizon Europe demonstrates continued interest across the research community, while In-Orbit Demonstration and Validation activities provide concrete pathways to test new technologies in space. Recent selections of innovative experiments, ranging from advanced sensors to propulsion and onboard computing systems, illustrate how in-orbit validation supports both technological excellence and industrial competitiveness.\nEmerging domains such as In-Space Operations and Services and space-based quantum technologies were discussed in the context of developing Europe’s capability to act in space. Strategic forums, joint declarations, and pilot missions signal a gradual but deliberate move towards operationalising these new areas, with a view to protecting assets and enabling future in-space economic activity.\n \nSustaining Europe’s space ecosystem\nWhile much of the conference focused on systems, services, and technologies, discussions repeatedly returned to the human and institutional foundations of Europe’s space ecosystem. Skills, education, and workforce development are essential to sustaining competitiveness and innovation over the long term.\nInitiatives such as the Space Career Launchpad, aimed at engaging young people, supporting career transitions, and broadening participation in the space sector illustrate a growing awareness that space opportunities extend well beyond traditional engineering roles. At the same time, efforts to strengthen governance frameworks are shaping how space activities are conducted across the Single Market.\n\n\nAgora session on skills for space. Credit: Business Bridge Europe.\n\n \nThe proposed EU Space Act featured as a key element of the governance discussion.

      "content": "OBSERVER: Security, competitiveness, and access to space discussed at the 18th European Space Conference\n\nThu, 29/01/2026 - 12:00\n\nAs Europe approaches a decisive moment for its space ambitions, the 18th European Space Conference convened policymakers, industry leaders, and institutional stakeholders to reflect on the choices shaping the continent’s space ecosystem over the coming decade. Held in the wake of the CM25 ESA Ministerial Council in Bremen and ongoing negotiations on the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework, the conference highlighted how space has become integral to Europe’s security, competitiveness, and strategic autonomy. Across two days of discussion in Brussels, attention shifted from vision-setting towards delivery, with a focus on operational capabilities, industrial resilience, and governance frameworks needed to sustain Europe’s space systems in a rapidly evolving global context. In this Observer, we look at some highlights from the conference.\n\nThe European Space Conference is a platform to address the most pressing topics and challenges faced in the European space ecosystem. Credit: Business Bridge Europe.\n\nA turning point for Europe’s space policy\n\nThe European Space Conference took place on 27-28 January in Brussels, at a moment when several major decision-making processes are converging for Europe’s space sector. Negotiations on the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework, including the proposed European Competitiveness Fund, are unfolding alongside reflections on the future direction of the EU Space Programme and the implementation of commitments taken at the most recent ESA Ministerial Council. Together, these processes are defining not only funding levels, but also priorities, governance models, and the way in which Europe intends to position itself in space over the coming decade.\n\nDiscussions during the two-day conference reflected a shared understanding that space assets and services have become strategic infrastructure. Satellite navigation, Earth Observation, secure communications, and Space Situational Awareness increasingly support European policy objectives ranging from climate monitoring and disaster response to security, defence, and economic resilience. As a result, decisions taken in the coming years will have long-term implications for Europe’s autonomy both in space and from space. The challenge ahead is not in expanding Europe’s space capabilities, but ensuring that they remain reliable, interoperable, and resilient in an environment characterised by geopolitical uncertainty, technological competition, and growing demand for space-based services\n\n“We shall spend a lot of our attention strengthening European cooperation; not to allow our space sector to be fragmented, overlapping, and not as effective as we would like to build. That is where we shall need to cooperate very well and effectively with Member States which are also developing their own capabilities.”\n\n- European Commissioner for Defence and Space, Andrius Kubilius\n\nFrom ambition to operational delivery\n\nA recurring theme at the conference was the transition from strategic ambition to concrete delivery. This shift is already visible across the EU Space Programme and its components, where recent milestones have reinforced continuity and long-term operational delivery.\n\nIn a session dedicated to satellite navigation, discussions focused on the completion of the first generation of Galileo satellites, reflecting the system’s growing role in sustaining economic activity and public services worldwide. Attention was also given to preparations for the next phase of development, including the transition toward launches of Galileo Second Generation (G2G) satellites. Today, more than 4.5 billion GNSS-enabled devices are in use globally, illustrating the scale at which satellite navigation has become embedded in everyday life. The successful launch of new satellites and the rollout of Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) have strengthened the system’s performance and security. OSNMA adds a layer of spoofing detection to open navigation signals and, as part of the Galileo Open Service, makes this capability freely available to all users. In doing so, Galileo is currently the only global navigation satellite system providing this capability through a free and open service. In parallel, testing of the Public Regulated Service (PRS) by EU Member States is advancing towards operational status. Together with EGNOS, Galileo continues to provide best-in-class navigation services to billions of devices worldwide, supporting both civilian and institutional users. Galileo’s tenth year of service provision underlined the importance of continuity and long-term reliability.\n\nPanel session on the evolving needs and capabilities for EO. Credit: Business Bridge Europe.\n\nEarth Observation (EO) featured prominently as another area where delivery and continuity are crucial. Over the past 18 months, six Copernicus Sentinel satellites have been successfully launched, ensuring the sustained provision of high-quality EO data. These launches, combined with ongoing upgrades, reinforce Europe’s position as a leading global provider of Earth Observation data. At the same time, the operational maturity of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and WEkEO illustrates how data access and processing infrastructures have become as important as satellites themselves. Beyond civil applications, discussions also addressed the evolving geopolitical context. The proposed development of a European Earth Observation Governmental Service (EOGS) reflects the need for timely, secure information to support security and defence decision-making. This need has informed ongoing preparatory work, including early development activities led by ESA under the European Resilience from Space initiative, which focus on maturing technologies and architectures that could contribute to a future EOGS capability. These efforts are complemented by broader coordination with defence stakeholders to help clarify requirements for secure, dual-use Earth Observation services for institutional users.\n\nSpace, security, and Europe’s strategic autonomy\n\nSecurity-related discussions formed a strong thread across the first day, cutting across sessions on connectivity, infrastructure protection, and space situational awareness. Sessions were focused on continuity of services, risk management, and resilience in an increasingly congested and contested environment.\n\nSecure connectivity was one area where this approach was evident. Discussions on governmental satellite communications reflected progress towards operational readiness. With the recent launch of GOVSATCOM operations, all Member States have access to secure satellite communications for governmental and military use, delivered through infrastructure built and operated in Europe and remaining fully under EU control. This step was presented as enabling the transition from preparatory phases towards service delivery, complementing broader efforts to strengthen secure connectivity through initiatives such as IRIS², which is now focused on implementation following the signature of the concession contract with the SpaceRISE consortium.\n\nSpace situational awareness also featured prominently, particularly in the context of space traffic management. The expansion of the EU Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) partnership, growing coverage of satellites, and increasing uptake of services by non-EU users illustrate how European capabilities are evolving in response to congestion and risk in orbit. As EU SST approaches a decade of service provision, its role in safeguarding space assets is increasingly seen as foundational.\n\nCompetitiveness, access to space, and scaling Europe’s industry\n\nDiscussions on the second day placed renewed focus on access to space as an enabling condition for Europe’s space ecosystem. Competitiveness was addressed as a structural challenge spanning the entire space value chain in discussions that highlighted its relevance for Europe’s strategic autonomy and the reduction of critical dependencies. Ensuring access to space was highlighted as a key enabler of Europe’s space ambitions. Ensuring autonomous, reliable, and cost-effective launch capabilities for institutional and commercial users remains a central concern, particularly in the context of reducing external dependencies amid global market pressures.\n\nPolicy instruments aimed at strengthening Europe’s launch ecosystem were discussed as part of a broader strategy. Aggregation of institutional demand, market transparency, and support for innovation were recurring themes. These discussions were complemented by a dedicated award ceremony held during the conference, where the winners of the Game-changing Innovations for European Launch Solutions initiative were recognised. Five selected projects received €950,000 each, showing how targeted incentives are being used to support disruptive innovation and Europe’s future access to space. The next edition of the award is expected to feature a significantly expanded prize purse totalling €20 million.\n\nArianeGroup’s high strength oxygen-compatible alloy, V-Loy, as one of the five projects awarded.

The European Competitiveness Fund and the Vision for the European Space Economy provided a backdrop for these exchanges. Panellists discussed how industrial resilience, production capacity, and scale-up pathways are becoming as relevant as technological innovation itself. Initiatives supporting start-ups and SMEs, including CASSINI, were referenced as tools to help bridge the gap between innovation and market maturity, particularly in a challenging economic environment.\n\n“Time is of the essence. We need to be able to pull together the national skills and constellations, European industry- big and small, the primes, and the newcomers in the best possible way.”\n\n-Director General for Defence Industry and Space, Timo Pesonen\n\nTechnology sovereignty, research, and acting in space\n\nThe final sessions of the conference looked towards the capabilities and frameworks needed to sustain Europe’s space ambitions over the long term. Panels underscored the importance of investing upstream to secure Europe’s future capabilities. Technology sovereignty emerged as a cross-cutting priority, closely tied to supply chain resilience and industrial autonomy.\n\nStrong participation in space-related calls under Horizon Europe demonstrates continued interest across the research community, while In-Orbit Demonstration and Validation activities provide concrete pathways to test new technologies in space. Recent selections of innovative experiments, ranging from advanced sensors to propulsion and onboard computing systems, illustrate how in-orbit validation supports both technological excellence and industrial competitiveness.\n\nEmerging domains such as In-Space Operations and Services and space-based quantum technologies were discussed in the context of developing Europe’s capability to act in space. Strategic forums, joint declarations, and pilot missions signal a gradual but deliberate move towards operationalising these new areas, with a view to protecting assets and enabling future in-space economic activity.\n\nSustaining Europe’s space ecosystem\n\nWhile much of the conference focused on systems, services, and technologies, discussions repeatedly returned to the human and institutional foundations of Europe’s space ecosystem. Skills, education, and workforce development are essential to sustaining competitiveness and innovation over the long term.\n\nInitiatives such as the Space Career Launchpad, aimed at engaging young people, supporting career transitions, and broadening participation in the space sector illustrate a growing awareness that space opportunities extend well beyond traditional engineering roles. At the same time, efforts to strengthen governance frameworks are shaping how space activities are conducted across the Single Market.\n\nAgora session on skills for space.

He had planned on working in computer technologies or on cars in his future. Then the opportunity appeared to work with higher-powered engines.\n\nNASA’s Doug Parkinson is the Launch Integration and Mission Operations lead for the SLS (Space Launch System) Program. NASA/Brandon Hancock\n\n“I came across an opportunity to work at the Propulsion Research Center at the university. I studied new propulsion technologies. That intrigued me because, as an undergrad, it was a chance to put into practical use what I was learning in the books and in theory,” said Parkinson. “It ended up being a lot of fun and very educational. It was in cutting edge technologies that really inspired me.”\n\nJoining NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1999, he began helping develop advanced liquid rocket engines, including the Fastrac and J-2X engines. The J-2X was an advanced development of the upper stage engine used on the Saturn V.\n\n“In 2012, I moved to SLS. One of the things I learned in the propulsion area with all the engine testing was test operations. That translated well into my new role as operations lead for the stages element,” said Parkinson.\n\nNow, he also serves as one of the SLS Engineering Support Center managers, helping oversee and train the SLS Engineering Support Team responsible for monitoring the rocket’s systems. The team operates at NASA Marshall and is critical to verifying the rocket is performing well.\n\nParkinson is the first person to hold the Launch Integration and Mission Operations leadership position in the SLS Program.\n\n“I love all aspects of the operations. I like getting my hands dirty. I like seeing the erector set go together,” said Parkinson.\n\nWhen the Artemis II astronauts fly by the Moon, soaring within just a few thousand miles of the lunar surface, they will do so having been launched on a rocket Parkinson helped develop.\n\nI have goosebumps just thinking about it,” he said. “I’ll be on console for part of that time, listening to what they have to say.
