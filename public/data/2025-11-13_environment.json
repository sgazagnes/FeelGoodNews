      "content": "Ulrich Eichelmann has seen many rivers over his lifetime as the head of RiverWatch, an organization dedicated to protecting the world’s waterways. He’s spent time on the Tigris floating through Turkey and Iraq, on the Tagliamento in Italy, and traveled along the Danube as it winds across Europe. Yet none, he said, have measured up to the Vjosa River. From the Greek Pindus Mountains, its rushing headwaters flow 169 miles to Albania’s Mediterranean coast, calming as it finally nears the sea.\n\n“The river is a bit like an intact living being,” Eichelmann said. “It starts young and fast in the mountains of Greece, and it ends as an old river near the Adriatic Sea.”\n\nThe Vjosa is dam-free, a rare feat in a world where the majority of rivers are confined by barriers. While hydropower dams may provide so-called “clean” energy, they also destroy ecosystems and emit methane. Fish can get trapped, unable to reach their spawning grounds, while nearby communities can be displaced. The Vjosa, however, remains one of Europe’s last free-flowing systems of water. The entire watershed is still untouched and is now likely to remain that way, thanks to a public-private coalition that created Europe’s first wild river national park in Albania — fighting dozens of planned dams along the way.\n\nOutdoor apparel company Patagonia’s support was integral to the effort, providing both resources and advocacy that helped turn local activists’ bold vision into reality. In 2013, activists launched the Save the Blue Heart of Europe campaign to raise awareness about the environmental impacts of a Balkan hydropower boom. But the coalition needed international attention, and in 2018, Patagonia joined in, bringing much-needed funding and creativity that helped turn the campaign into a global cause.\n\nOnce slated for the Kalivaç Dam, this stretch of Albania’s Vjosa River was spared when an administrative court in Tirana decided against the project in 2021.\n\nAndrew Burr\n\nIts quiet support is typical of Patagonia’s long history of environmental activism. But until now, the company has never attempted to measure its full impact — both successes and shortcomings. That’s about to change: Patagonia has just released its comprehensive “Work in Progress Report,” outlining the company’s improvements and challenges, and sharing a roadmap for others in the private sector. “Businesses created a lot of the environmental problems that we as humans are now navigating,” said Patagonia’s CEO, Ryan Gellert. “We’ve got an outsized responsibility to do something about it.”\n\nGellert recognizes the paradox of a company fighting for a healthier planet while also selling consumers products they may not need. “I can sit here and make an argument that we should grow as fast as we can so we have more money to give away,” he said. Conversely, as a producer of apparel that requires fossil fuels, he sees the argument that “the best we could do for the planet is shut down.” The truth, he said, lies somewhere in between. Spelling out these nuances — and how to prove business can be a positive force for change — is what the company hopes to tease out in its 134-page report.\n\nPatagonia’s environmental activism began close to home in Ventura, California, where it awarded its first grant in 1973 to Friends of Ventura River, even offering the group office space at its nearby headquarters. “We’ve got a really long history on river protection,” Gellert noted. When plans to divert the nearby Ventura River threatened both its health and the surf break at its mouth, Patagonia employees began showing up at council meetings. The experience taught them that they could shape local conservation decisions — and that rivers knit together the entire ecosystem of a community. That led to the company’s 1985 “Earth Tax,” which set aside one percent of all sales for grassroots environmental groups — a model that later helped inspire the “1% for the Planet” movement.\n\nPatagonia’s work has grown to include causes around the globe — from defending the Tarkine rainforest in Tasmania in 2018 to helping add five new marine protected areas to Korea in 2023. The company also encourages its own employees to volunteer and attend non-violent direct action training, as well as covering their bail. Though this approach alienates some customers, it has become a central part of the company’s ethos.\n\nThe company has expanded its grants program with the Holdfast Collective, a collection of nonprofit trusts that now own 98 percent of Patagonia. It uses every dollar received to protect nature and advocate for causes and candidates that put the planet first. Its goal is to distribute company profits to causes like saving the Vjosa, which it has contributed nearly $5 million dollars to since 2023.\n\nAfter its European team raised alarm over the Vjosa’s future, the company helped produce two films, as well as financially supported the Save the Blue Heart campaign. They launched a petition that drew international attention, including from celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio. Simultaneously, the company decided to also give money to the Albanian government, allowing them to back grassroots advocacy while also helping shape policy decisions. The result of this symbiosis was the government’s 2023 announcement of the Vjosa Wild River National Park.\n\nAlbanian Minister for culture and environment, Mirela Kumbaro, and Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert sign a Memorandum of Understanding for the creation of the Vjosa National Park, on June 13, 2022 in Tirana, Albania.\n\nNick St. Oegger\n\nThis victory, Gellert said, shows the power of Patagonia’s lead-from-behind ethos. He remembers the team’s first visit to the river almost 10 years ago. They spent their first night camping along the riverbank, before taking the next few days to raft the rapids and participate in a local protest. At the time, Gellert wasn’t confident they could save the river: Finding a way to engage with political leaders took patience and years of dialogue, particularly as Albania faced contested elections. Gellert met with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama in person several times to discuss the Vjosa’s future, serving as a mediator between local advocates and the government.\n\nEngaging with communities along the Vjosa was also key to keeping dams away, explained Olsi Nika, executive director of EcoAlbania, a coalition member organization. The river is home to some 100,00 people, who rely on it for fishing, agriculture and cultural traditions, as well as over a thousand species. With Patagonia’s help, EcoAlbania brought together residents, artists, scientists, and lawyers to build a successful front against dam construction, resulting in Albania’s first-ever environmental lawsuit.\n\nThe courts ultimately ruled in its favor, blocking a dam and setting an important legal precedent. Nika — who, along with his collaborator Besjana Guri, won a Goldman Prize award for their advocacy for the river this year — said that victory opens the door for future lawsuits. “We are following dozens of open cases in the court to oppose the construction of hydropower.”\n\nPatagonia’s role, which has since been formalized through a memorandum with the government, remains crucial. Two years after the Vjosa was designated a national park. pressures on the local water supply are mounting as developers race to build resorts and accommodations just outside its borders, said Besjana Guri, who recently left EcoAlbania to found a nonprofit focusing on empowering women and youth. “Now, we might have small threats,” Guri said, “but if they are not managed well and if the people are not totally aware, they can become big threats.”\n\nBesjana Guri along a stretch of the Vjosa River in Albania.\n\nNick St. Oegger\n\nThe country has approved a 10-year plan to manage the park’s more than 31,000 acres, said Daniel Pirushi, who handles environmental policy and development for the Albanian Ministry of Tourism and Environment. Visitors will be strictly zoned to specific areas. Sensitive river sections will have limits on how many out-of-towners can arrive. The government is also working to improve wastewater systems for rural communities along the Vjosa Basin to address pollution.\n\nIn December, the government established a formal office to help with the park’s enforcement and environmental oversight. A visitor center is planned to feature local exhibitions and activities that would improve public awareness of how special the ecosystem is. “The establishment of a national park, especially one of this scale and complexity, cannot be achieved overnight,” Pirushi wrote in an email. “The protection of the Vjosa is not a symbolic act but a concrete, evolving process grounded in science, policy, and partnership.”\n\nWorking together, Patagonia has learned, is what makes these kinds of lasting environmental protections possible. After achieving a turning point for the Vjosa campaign, the company is looking to inspire other businesses, especially outdoor companies, whose work is closely tied to the Earth’s health. As Alison Huyett, a senior strategist at Patagonia who led the report, said, the goal is to show business audiences “activism doesn’t have to be scary.”\n\nWe’re in business to save our home planet. Founded by Yvon Chouinard in 1973, Patagonia is an outdoor apparel company based in Ventura, California. As a certified B Corporation and a founding member of 1% for the Planet, the company is recognized internationally for its product quality and environmental activism, as well as its contributions of more than $230 million to environmental organizations. Its unique ownership structure reflects that Earth is its only shareholder: Profits not reinvested back into the business are paid as dividends to protect the planet.",

      "content": "UK's first small nuclear power station to be built in north Wales\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Gareth Lewis, Wales political editor and Steffan Messenger, Wales environment correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC Work will begin next year, with the aim of generating power by the mid 2030s\n\nA first-of-its-kind nuclear power station is to be built on Anglesey, bringing up to 3,000 jobs and billions of pounds of investment. The plant at Wylfa, on the Welsh island's northern coast, will have the UK's first three small modular reactors (SMR), although the site could potentially hold up to eight. Work is due to start next year with the aim of generating power by the mid 2030s. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Britain was once a world leader in nuclear power, but years of neglect and inertia has meant places like Anglesey have been let down and left behind. Today, that changes.\"\n\nThe news was also welcomed by First Minister Eluned Morgan, who said she had been \"pressing the case at every opportunity for Wylfa's incredible benefits\". Using the Welsh name for Anglesey, she described it as \"the moment Ynys Môn and the whole of Wales has been waiting for\". The project, which could power about three million homes, will be built by publicly owned Great British Energy-Nuclear and is backed by a £2.5bn investment from the UK government. Simon Bowen, chair of Great British Energy-Nuclear, said: \"This is a historic moment for the UK, and is another momentous step in realising Britain's potential in leading the way on nuclear energy. \"These first SMRs at Wylfa will lay the groundwork for a fleet-based approach to nuclear development, strengthening the UK's energy independence and bringing long-term investment to the local economy.\"\n\nThe company has also been tasked with identifying potential sites for another large-scale nuclear power plant, similar to those being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset and Sizewell in Suffolk, which have the potential to power the equivalent of six million homes. It will report back by autumn 2026, and has been requested by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband to consider sites across the UK, including in Scotland, officials said. It is not clear whether the SMR plans, which are smaller and more straightforward to build, rule Wylfa out from being considered after it was designated the preferred location in 2024 by the previous UK Conservative government. The decision to opt for small modular reactors at Wylfa was criticised by the US ambassador Warren Stephens, who said he was \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision. He had been urging ministers to commit to a large-scale plant, with US firm Westinghouse having reportedly presented plans to build a new gigawatt station at the site. \"If you want to get shovels in the ground as soon as possible and take a big step in addressing energy prices and availability, there is a different path, and we look forward to decisions soon on large-scale nuclear projects,\" Mr Stephens said.\n\n'Nuclear equivalent of an Ikea chair'\n\nOne industry expert described the announcement as \"incredible\". Prof Simon Middleburgh, director of the Nuclear Futures Institute at Bangor University, said: \"They're smaller than the average reactor, built in a modular manner in factories and shipped to the site to be put together a bit like an Ikea chair.\" The planned SMRs \"fit nicely\" with the existing grid capacity at the Wylfa site, offering a similar electricity output as the old power plant currently being decommissioned, he added. There were \"a few more hurdles to go through\", he cautioned - from securing regulatory approval, building the factories required to construct the SMRs and training the workforce that will run them. Opponents of the project point to the fact that a long-term storage facility for the UK's nuclear waste is yet to be agreed upon and say investment in renewable energy schemes - wind, wave and tidal - is what Anglesey needs. Dylan Morgan of campaign group People Against Wylfa-B told BBC Wales the proposed SMRs were far from \"small\" and were in fact \"an unnecessarily big development of an unproven technology\". \"Modular reactor technologies have been touted by many companies internationally but are still only plans on paper,\" he said.\n\nWylfa beat off competition from another site at Oldbury in Gloucestershire, with the reactors designed by British engineering firm Rolls-Royce, subject to final contracts, which are expected later this year. The UK government said the plant would help provide energy independence. The old nuclear power plant at Wylfa was switched off in 2015 and previous plans for a large-scale replacement fell through in 2021. The company behind the scheme – the Japanese industrial giant Hitachi - cited spiralling costs and a failure to reach agreement with the UK government over funding. Sasha Wynn Davies - now chairwoman of the Wales Nuclear Forum - worked as a senior manager on those plans. \"I will never forget going to the secondary school in Amlwch and speaking to some of the young students and pupils there to unfortunately say that we were not progressing as a project,\" she said. \"I will never forget their faces as they were so sad on behalf of their hopes for the future but also for their parents and what it meant for the area economically and socially. \"So now let's hope our time has come again and there's hope for our young people in particular.\"",

      "content": "Looking for a way to raise money for your favorite nonprofit or charity — without asking donors for money?\n\nIf you live in one of the 10 U.S. states with bottle bills or one of the roughly 60 states, provinces, or countries worldwide that collect container deposits on beverage cans and bottles, consider collecting and redeeming clean empties and donating the proceeds to worthy causes.\n\nYou’ll not just help the recipients, you’ll also increase these containers’ chances of being responsibly recycled, rather than going into landfills or fouling ground and water ecosystems. Plus, you’ll be part of a growing movement that’s modernizing how we recycle.\n\nThe Power of Deposit Return Systems\n\nContainer deposit programs, also known as Deposit Return Systems (DRS), are remarkably effective at capturing beverage containers for recycling. Research shows that deposit return systems help our planet and your wallet, with states that have bottle bills achieving recycling rates between 60-90% compared to just 24-26% in states without such programs.\n\nRecent modernization efforts are paying off. Connecticut’s redemption rate jumped from 44% in 2023 to 65% in 2024 after increasing the state increased deposits from 5¢ to 10¢ and expanded the types of containers covered. California collected 1.5 billion more containers in 2024 after adding wine and spirits bottles to its deposit program. These successes demonstrate that updated programs with higher deposits and broader coverage dramatically improve recycling outcomes.\n\nTurning Container Deposit Refunds Into Donations\n\nGlobally, can and bottle deposit refunds provide millions of dollars to charities and nonprofits annually. Many deposit refund centers make it easy for you to donate your refunds to charities through various methods:\n\nCLYNK System (Northeastern U.S.): CLYNK operates collection centers in Iowa, Maine, New York, and Oregon in the U.S., as well as in New Brunswick, Canada. Their innovative bag-drop system has helped recycle over 2.6 billion containers and facilitated more than $4.7 million in donations through their “CLYNK to Give” program. Users can easily direct their refunds to thousands of participating nonprofits.\n\nBottleDrop Give (Oregon): Oregon’s BottleDrop Give program has become one of the nation’s most successful container deposit fundraising systems. Since 2015, thousands of Oregon nonprofits have raised funds through the Blue Bag program, where supporters fill bags with containers and drop them at any BottleDrop location. The program has:\n\nSupported fundraising for thousands of nonprofits statewide\n\nCreated the BottleDrop Emergency Fund, which raised $200,000 for the Oregon Food Bank during COVID-19\n\nLaunched matching donation campaigns, with donations up to $35,000 matched\n\nEnabled direct online transfers from BottleDrop accounts to nonprofit fundraising accounts\n\nOrganizations such as Oregon Energy Fund, the Association of Oregon Recyclers, and Oregon Environmental Council use BottleDrop Give for fundraising.\n\nTOMRA Reverse Vending Machines revolutionized container returns with advanced technology. In 2024, TOMRA launched the TOMRA R2 reverse vending machine with expanded charity donation capabilities.\n\nTOMRA machines used by Australia’s Return and Earn program have helped raise over $2.5 million for charities, schools, and community groups. Victoria’s Container Deposit Scheme, which launched in November 2023, allows consumers to make donations through reverse vending machines and mobile apps.\n\nTraditional Collection Methods: Many redemption centers now offer donation envelopes at their locations, making it easy to designate your refund to charity. These lower-tech options remain popular at smaller, independent redemption centers that don’t use automated systems.\n\nPlus, Traditional Grassroots Efforts: Watch for one-time and ongoing efforts by individuals, schools, religious groups, scout troops, and other organizations that collect containers through drives and community campaigns.\n\nStates with Deposit Programs in 2025\n\nCurrently, 10 U.S. states have active container deposit systems:\n\nC alifornia (10¢; expanded to include wine/spirits and juice containers in 2024)\n\nConnecticut (10¢)\n\nHawaii (5¢)\n\nIowa (5¢)\n\nMaine (5¢-15¢ depending on container size)\n\nMassachusetts (5¢)\n\nMichigan (10¢)\n\nNew York (5¢; 10¢ increase proposed)\n\nOregon (10¢)\n\nVermont (5¢-15¢ depending on container size)\n\nNote: Several states, including Minnesota, are actively considering bottle bill legislation for implementation in 2026.\n\nFinding Bottle Donation & Redemption Centers\n\nAny place that collects can or bottle deposits will also have one or more redemption venues:\n\nRetail Stores, particularly beverage stores, often have reverse vending machines where you can insert your returns for cash, store credit, or account credit. You may already shop at a store that has one of these. Some of these machines only accept containers for brands sold at the store, while newer models like TOMRA’s R2 can process 100+ containers at once in a multi-feed system.\n\nRedemption Centers, whether private or government-run centers, usually accept a wider variety of container brands than retail stores. They typically have a per-day/per-person limit, restricting the number of items or the total amount you can redeem that day. Modern centers like BottleDrop Redemption Centers offer self-serve machines, hand counting, and bag drop services.\n\nBulk Redemption Programs are helpful if you have large quantities of cans or bottles. However, your redemption is typically calculated by weight, with the payment translating to as little as one cent per can, versus the container redemption of five cents or more. Oregon’s BottleDrop offers high-volume plant drop-offs for nonprofits running large collection drives.\n\nPreparing to Donate\n\nStep 1: Choose Your Worthy Causes\n\nIf your favorite charity or nonprofit already has container deposit-redemption relationships or you can drop off your empties for them to redeem, follow their instructions.\n\nIf they don’t, look for redemption options that let you direct the money to them, pick another organization, or pick from the worthy causes that local collection and redemption centers support. Alternatively, you can redeem your containers in the most convenient location and send your refund to your favorite worthy cause.\n\nNew for 2025: Check if your charity is registered with programs like:\n\nBottleDrop Give in Oregon\n\nCLYNK to Give in Maine, New York, Iowa, or Oregon\n\nTOMRA donation partners in states using TOMRA machines\n\nVictorian Container Deposit Scheme in Australia (for international reference)\n\nStep 2: Identify Where You’ll Redeem Your Cans and Bottles\n\nFind local collection/redemption centers, “reverse vending machines,” other collection sites (such as nonprofits or schools), and/or local will-pick-up organizations.\n\nYour local supermarket or beverage store is likely to redeem cans and bottles. If they don’t, ask them where you can drop off your containers for your deposit refund. You can also find information about potential redemption locations via:\n\nBottleBill.org’s state-by-state guide\n\nWeb search (including city, state, country sites)\n\nBottleDrop locations (Oregon)\n\nCLYNK locations (Northeast states)\n\nTown/area bulletin boards and mailing lists\n\nCity Hall, your local library, schools, and civic or religious groups\n\nStep 3: Understand What They Accept and How Their Program Works\n\nDo you need to take bottles to one location and cans to another? Are there brand or size limits? What are their rules (maximum quantity per drop, day, etc.)? Do you need to set up an account or install a mobile app? Do they offer tags or bags?\n\nDigital Tools (2025): Many programs now offer mobile apps and digital features:\n\nBottleDrop app (Oregon): Account management and direct nonprofit donations\n\nReturn and Earn app (Australia): TOMRA’s system for tracking and donations\n\nTOMRA’s digital voucher system : QR codes for paperless refunds (no app needed)\n\nCLYNK’s online account system : Web-based account management and nonprofit selection\n\nStep 4: Get Set Up for Collecting Your Containers\n\nSet up a place to collect and sort containers, for example, a box next to the kitchen trash or bags in the kitchen closet.\n\nConfirm preparation preferences (for each redemption target), including:\n\nDo you need to sort containers by material type (aluminum versus plastic versus glass)?\n\nDo you need to empty and rinse containers that aren’t just water or seltzer?\n\nIs including plastic bottle caps OK or even preferred?\n\nShould containers be crushed or uncrushed?\n\nIf your household includes other people — or if you have occasional guests and other visitors — consider making signage listing container types to keep and these preparation steps.\n\nStep 5: Start Saving, Redeeming, and Donating!\n\nSave your empties and keep an eye out for additional sources of cans and bottles that may be currently be discarded, such as schools, events, offices, and community gatherings. Periodically drop off your empties or, where appropriate, schedule a pickup.\n\nMaximize Impact: Consider organizing a community collection drive by partnering with local businesses or hosting events where people can drop off containers.\n\nAdditional Tips for Success\n\nBased on my own efforts and feedback from successful fundraisers, here are key recommendations:\n\nVisit Locations In Person\n\nBefore settling on a drop-off location, I strongly urge you to make an in-person visit to understand how they will handle your containers. Many are informal and old-school, with little or no online information, and may not return phone messages. However, newer facilities with TOMRA machines and BottleDrop centers typically offer more reliable digital details and customer service.\n\nLev erage Technology\n\nTake advantage of digital tools offered by modern systems:\n\nBottleDrop (Oregon): Set up online accounts for automatic tracking and real-time donation monitoring\n\nCLYNK : Use bag tags with QR codes for easy account crediting\n\nTOMRA machines : Scan QR codes for digital vouchers or select on-screen charity partners\n\nMob ile apps : Download system-specific apps where available for convenient account management\n\nMatching campaigns : Watch for special matching donation opportunities (like BottleDrop’s $35K match program)\n\nOrganize Effectively\n\nHere’s some additional deposit bottle collection fundraiser advice from Fundraiser Insight:\n\nCreate clear signage for collection points\n\nEstablish regular pickup schedules\n\nPartner with local businesses for collection sites\n\nPromote your efforts on social media\n\nThank donors and share impact stories\n\nHow You Can Advocate\n\nIf you don’t live in one of the 10 states where deposit programs are currently in force:\n\nContact your state legislators and ask them to introduce and support bottle bill legislation. BottleBill.org offers a helpful guide to launching a bottle bill campaign in your state. Start your local campaign by visiting several grocers and asking to speak with the managers. Tell them you’re considering where you’ll do your grocery shopping. Share your desire to see a bottle bill and urge their company to join the call for modern DRS programs in your state. Ask retailers to provide bottle and can drop-off bins as a first step, even before legislation passes. Share success stories from states like Connecticut, which saw redemption rates jump 21 percentage points after modernization.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nDepending upon your local container deposit redemption options, you may be able to turn your empty containers — and those from friends, businesses, and organizations — into funding for worthy causes. While you’ll likely need a bit of patience and commitment, and should be prepared for some frustration both in locating venues and in processing the returns/redemptions, the results are worth it.\n\nWith 2025 bringing expanded programs, improved technology, and growing awareness of the benefits of deposit return systems, now is an excellent time to start collecting containers for charity. Whether you’re using traditional bag-and-drop methods or reverse vending machines with digital donation capabilities, you’re contributing to environmental sustainability and community resilience.\n\nEditor’s Note: Originally published on November 11, 2020, this article was substantially updated in November 2025.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** –\nMany places in the U.S. and around the world have container deposit programs, also called Deposit Return Systems (DRS). These programs let people return empty bottles and cans to get a small refund, usually a few cents per container. Some states in the U.S. have these programs, which help increase recycling and reduce waste.\n\n**What happened** –\nPeople can now donate their container deposit refunds to charities and nonprofits instead of keeping the money. Programs like CLYNK, BottleDrop Give in Oregon, and TOMRA machines in Australia make it easy to give the refund directly to good causes. These systems have helped raise millions of dollars for organizations by collecting and recycling containers.\n\n**Impact** –\nThese programs improve recycling rates dramatically, sometimes from around 25% to as high as 90%. At the same time, they provide a steady source of funds for charities, schools, and community groups. For example, Oregon’s BottleDrop program raised $200,000 for the Oregon Food Bank during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using modern machines and apps also makes donating easier and more reliable.\n\n**What's next step** –\nMore states are considering starting container deposit programs, and new technology will continue to make donating refunds simpler. People can organize collection drives and use digital tools to track donations. Those who don’t live in states with these programs are encouraged to ask their local leaders to support such laws.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** –\nReturning empty bottles and cans through deposit programs not only helps the environment but also raises money for charities in many communities.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** –\nDans plusieurs régions des États-Unis et dans le monde, il existe des programmes de consigne sur les contenants. Ces systèmes permettent de rapporter les bouteilles et canettes vides pour obtenir un petit remboursement. Certains États américains ont ces programmes qui favorisent le recyclage et réduisent les déchets.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** –\nIl est désormais possible de donner le remboursement de la consigne à des associations et organismes caritatifs au lieu de garder l’argent. Des programmes comme CLYNK, BottleDrop Give en Oregon, et les machines TOMRA en Australie facilitent ce don direct. Ces systèmes ont permis de collecter des millions de dollars pour des organisations grâce au recyclage.\n\n**Impact** –\nCes programmes augmentent fortement les taux de recyclage, passant parfois de 25 % à 90 %. En même temps, ils fournissent un soutien financier régulier aux associations, écoles et groupes communautaires. Par exemple, BottleDrop en Oregon a récolté 200 000 $ pour la banque alimentaire locale pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Les machines modernes et applications rendent aussi les dons plus simples et fiables.\n\n**Prochaine étape** –\nD’autres États envisagent d’adopter ces programmes, et la technologie continuera de faciliter les dons.

States parties to CITES can add more species by submitting proposals which are considered at meetings held every three years.\n\n“The proposals to be discussed highlight how scientists continue to address conservation and sustainable use across species that are not only biologically unique, but also culturally, economically and ecologically significant,” said Thea Carroll, CITES Secretariat Science Unit Chief, speaking in Geneva.\n\nThe final proposals slated for discussion in the Uzbek city of Samarkand include a range of perennially endangered wildlife such as elephants and rhinos, along with what must surely be the latest CITES pin-up candidate, the Golden-bellied mangabey monkey.\n\nAdditional protection requests alongside these natural born charmers include arguably less obvious candidates, including the giant Galli wasp – all 32 centimetres of it – moths, frogs, sea cucumber, abalone and other commercially exploited aquatic species.\n\nIt’s been 50 years since the CITES convention entered into force, although it was originally conceived a decade earlier at a meeting of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nThe Convention is just one of several international accords aimed at protecting the planet’s biodiversity. It specifically addresses regulation of the international wildlife trade that’s estimated to be worth billions of dollars and to include hundreds of millions of plant and animal specimens.\n\n© Unsplash/2H Media A young Nile crocodile rests on the riverbank by the Kazinga channel in Uganda.\n\nSuccess stories\n\nThe Convention has been behind conservation success stories including the South American vicuña - a small camel - and the Nile crocodile.\n\nTheir survival was assured when CITES supported national efforts to turn their wool and skins respectively into valuable and sustainably managed commodities that benefit local communities.\n\nOverexploitation for international trade presents a major threat to wildlife but other risk factors include disease, pollution, a loss of habitat or the fragmentation of habitats.\n\nWho protects the protectors\n\nThe fundamental biodiversity protection role played by CITES has not shielded it from a dire funding crisis for multilateral work everywhere, warned the organization’s Secretary-General, Ivonne Higuero.\n\n“We're all struggling,” she told journalists in Geneva. “All the entities of the UN are struggling right now with budgetary issues. There's a falling of contributions from the Member States, from our Parties, and this is becoming very difficult for us to be able to operate.”\n\nMs. Higuero added: “We have not been receiving the expected contributions from the parties that have that is assessed according to the UN scale and of course we have arrears and payments. So this is one of the things that we will also be discussing.”",
