      "content": "Key Points:\n\nStanford engineers have discovered a standout material, strontium titanate (STO), that performs even better in extreme cold. Instead of weakening, its optical and mechanical properties improve at cryogenic temperatures.\n\nSTO outperforms every comparable material tested in low-temperature environments, revealing exceptional strength, stability, and tunability.\n\nIts unique capabilities could accelerate advances in quantum computing, laser systems, and space exploration, where high performance under freezing conditions is essential.\n\nSuperconductivity and quantum computing have moved from theoretical physics into real-world innovation. The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics recognized breakthroughs in superconducting quantum circuits that could lead to ultra-powerful computers. Yet many of these technologies only function at cryogenic temperatures (near absolute zero), where most materials lose their defining properties. Finding materials that perform under such extreme cold has long been one of science's biggest hurdles.\n\nA Crystal That Defies the Cold\n\nIn a new Science publication, engineers at Stanford University report a breakthrough with strontium titanate (STO), a material that not only maintains but enhances its optical and mechanical performance in freezing conditions. Instead of deteriorating, it becomes significantly more capable, outperforming other known materials by a wide margin. The researchers believe this discovery could open the door to a new class of light-based and mechanical cryogenic devices that propel quantum computing, space exploration, and other advanced technologies.\n\n\"Strontium titanate has electro-optic effects 40 times stronger than the most-used electro-optic material today. But it also works at cryogenic temperatures, which is beneficial for building quantum transducers and switches that are current bottlenecks in quantum technologies,\" explained the study's senior author Jelena Vuckovic, professor of electrical engineering at Stanford.\n\nPushing the Limits of Performance\n\nSTO's optical behavior is \"non-linear,\" meaning that when an electric field is applied, its optical and mechanical properties shift dramatically. This electro-optic effect allows scientists to adjust the frequency, intensity, phase, and direction of light in ways that other materials cannot. Such versatility could enable entirely new types of low-temperature devices.\n\nSTO is also piezoelectric, meaning it physically expands and contracts in response to electric fields. This makes it ideal for developing new electromechanical components that function efficiently in extreme cold. According to the researchers, these capabilities could be especially valuable for use in the vacuum of space or in the cryogenic fuel systems of rockets.\n\n\"At low temperature, not only is strontium titanate the most electrically tunable optical material we know of, but it's also the most piezoelectrically tunable material,\" said Christopher Anderson, co-first author and now a faculty member at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.\n\nAn Overlooked Material Finds New Purpose\n\nStrontium titanate is not a newly discovered substance. It has been studied for decades and is inexpensive and abundant. \"STO is not particularly special. It's not rare. It's not expensive,\" said co-first author Giovanni Scuri, a postdoctoral scholar in Vuckovic's lab. \"In fact, it has often been used as a diamond substitute in jewelry or as a substrate for growing other, more valuable materials. Despite being a 'textbook' material, it performs exceptionally well in a cryogenic context.\"\n\nThe decision to test STO was guided by an understanding of what characteristics make materials highly tunable. \"We knew what ingredients we needed to make a highly tunable material. We found those ingredients already existed in nature, and we simply used them in a new recipe. STO was the obvious choice,\" Anderson said. \"When we tried it, surprisingly, it matched our expectations perfectly.\"\n\nScuri added that the framework they developed could help identify or enhance other nonlinear materials for a variety of operating conditions.\n\nRecord-Breaking Performance at Near Absolute Zero\n\nWhen tested at 5 Kelvin (-450°F), STO's performance stunned researchers. Its nonlinear optical response was 20 times greater than that of lithium niobate, the leading nonlinear optical material, and nearly triple that of barium titanate, the previous cryogenic benchmark.\n\nTo push its properties even further, the team replaced certain oxygen atoms in the crystal with heavier isotopes. This adjustment moved STO closer to a state called quantum criticality, producing even greater tunability.\n\n\"By adding just two neutrons to exactly 33 percent of the oxygen atoms in the material, the resulting tunability increased by a factor of four,\" Anderson said. \"We precisely tuned our recipe to get the best possible performance.\"\n\nBuilding the Future of Cryogenic Devices\n\nAccording to the team, STO also offers practical advantages that could make it appealing to engineers. It can be synthesized, structurally modified, and fabricated at wafer scale using existing semiconductor equipment. These features make it well-suited for next-generation quantum devices, such as laser-based switches used to control and transmit quantum information.\n\nThe research was partially funded by Samsung Electronics and Google's quantum computing division, both of which are searching for materials to advance their quantum hardware. The team's next goal is to design fully functional cryogenic devices based on STO's unique properties.\n\n\"We found this material on the shelf. We used it and it was amazing. We understood why it was good. Then the cherry on the top -- we knew how to do better, added that special sauce, and we made the world's best material for these applications,\" Anderson said. \"It's a great story.\"\n\nAlongside Samsung and Google, the study received support from a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship through the U.S. Department of Defense and the Department of Energy's Q-NEXT program.\n\nContributors include Aaron Chan and Lu Li from the University of Michigan; Sungjun Eun, Alexander D. White, Geun Ho Ahn, Amir Safavi-Naeini, and Kasper Van Gasse from Stanford's E. L. Ginzton Laboratory; and Christine Jilly from the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities.",

Their work at the National Magnetic Field Laboratory suggests that the effect originates in the material’s bulk rather than its surface. The finding points toward a “new duality” in materials science—where compounds may behave as both metals and insulators—offering a fascinating puzzle for future research.",
      "content": "Lu Li, a physicist who studies advanced materials, knows that people often want to hear how his research could lead to new technologies or practical breakthroughs. But sometimes, what he uncovers is so unusual that its value lies purely in revealing how strange the universe can be.\n\nWorking with an international team of scientists, Li has made one of those discoveries, recently described in Physical Review Letters.\n\n\"I would love to claim that there's a great application, but my work keeps pushing that dream further away,\" said Li, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan. \"But what we've found is still really bizarre and exciting.\"\n\nQuantum Oscillations: When Electrons Act Like Springs\n\nSupported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, the research focuses on a puzzling effect called quantum oscillations. In metals, these oscillations occur when electrons behave like tiny springs, vibrating in response to magnetic fields. By changing the magnetic field's strength, scientists can alter how quickly these \"electron springs\" move.\n\nIn recent years, however, researchers have discovered the same quantum oscillations in insulators -- materials that should not conduct electricity or heat. That revelation has left scientists debating whether the effect originates only on the surface of these materials or deep within their interior (known as the bulk).\n\nSearching for Answers Inside the Material\n\nIf the oscillations came from the surface, that would be particularly exciting for potential technologies. Materials called topological insulators, which conduct electricity on their surfaces while remaining insulating inside, are already being studied for new kinds of electronic, optical, and quantum devices.\n\nTo explore the mystery, Li and his collaborators turned to the National Magnetic Field Laboratory, home to the most powerful magnets in the world. Their experiments revealed that the oscillations were not just a surface effect. Instead, they came from the bulk of the material itself.\n\n\"I wish I knew what to do with that, but at this stage we have no idea,\" Li admitted. \"What we have right now is experimental evidence of a remarkable phenomenon, we've recorded it and, hopefully, at some point, we'll realize how to use it.\"\n\nA Global Collaboration and a Clear Result\n\nThe study involved more than a dozen scientists from six institutions in the United States and Japan, including research fellow Kuan-Wen Chen and graduate students Yuan Zhu, Guoxin Zheng, Dechen Zhang, Aaron Chan, and Kaila Jenkins from the University of Michigan.\n\n\"For years, scientists have pursued the answer to a fundamental question about the carrier origin in this exotic insulator: Is it from the bulk or the surface, intrinsic or extrinsic?\" said Chen. \"We are excited to provide clear evidence that it is bulk and intrinsic.\"\n\nA \"New Duality\" in Physics\n\nLi describes the finding as part of what he calls a \"new duality.\" The original, or \"old,\" duality in physics emerged more than a century ago when scientists realized that light and matter can act as both waves and particles. That discovery transformed physics and led to technologies such as solar cells and electron microscopes.\n\nThe new duality, Li says, involves materials that can behave as both conductors and insulators. His team explored this idea using a compound called ytterbium boride (YbB12) inside a magnetic field so powerful that it reached 35 Tesla -- about 35 times stronger than the field inside a hospital MRI machine.\n\n\"Effectively, we're showing that this naive picture where we envisioned a surface with good conduction that's feasible to use in electronics is completely wrong,\" Li explained. \"It's the whole compound that behaves like a metal even though it's an insulator.\"\n\nUnlocking the Mystery of a \"Crazy Metal\"\n\nAlthough this \"metal-like\" behavior only appears under extreme magnetic conditions, the finding raises new questions about how materials behave at the quantum level.\n\n\"Confirming that the oscillations are bulk and intrinsic is exciting,\" said Zhu. \"We don't yet know what kind of neutral particles are responsible for the observation. We hope our findings motivate further experiments and theoretical work.\"\n\nThe project received additional support from the Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency.",
