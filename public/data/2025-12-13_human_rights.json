      "title": "UN mission’s exit marks milestone in Iraq’s post-conflict transition",
      "summary": "After more than two decades working alongside Iraq through war, political upheaval and the fight against ISIL terrorists, the UN Assistance Mission there (UNAMI) ends its mandate on 31 December – a closure its top official describes as “honourable, dignified, and earned”.",
      "content": "In an interview with UN News, Mr. Mohamed Al Hassan, Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) and UNAMI chief, said the Mission’s end reflects how far Iraq has come since it was set up in 2003, when the country was emerging from decades of dictatorship, regional wars and the terror wrought by ISIL – known more widely in the Middle East as Da’esh.\n\n“When UNAMI started, Iraq used to be a very different place than today”, he told UN News. Just days into the mission in August 2003 the UN came under attack at its Baghdad headquarters, leaving 22 staffers dead and over 100 wounded.\n\nUN Photo/Timothy Sopp A truck bomb destroyed the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August 2003.\n\nToday, a new era has dawned: “With the sacrifices of the Iraqis first and foremost, and with international support, in particular the United Nations, Iraq believes it is ready to move to another phase, solidifying its sovereignty and territorial integrity. I wholeheartedly believe that Iraq is ready for that.”\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres will travel to Baghdad to join Iraqis and the diplomatic community in marking the Mission’s closure - an event he called a clear signal that this is “mission accomplished”.\n\nDemocratic progress\n\nMr. Al Hassan said Iraq’s recent political developments underscore how dramatically the country has stabilised.\n\nThe parliamentary elections held in November, which UNAMI supported, were widely viewed as among the most credible to date. With a 56 per cent voter turnout, they were also a demonstration of renewed public engagement.\n\n“It was the most fair, free and peaceful elections,” he said. “When you see an election that fair and democratic, you know that that’s a belief in a new Iraq.”\n\nUNAMI A voter at a polling station in Erbil, Kurdistan Region, Iraq, on Election Day. (file)\n\nOver the years, UNAMI has provided critical support across a wide range of areas: advising the Government on political stabilisation, promoting inclusive national dialogue, and supporting community-level reconciliation in areas affected by conflict.\n\nIt has also played a central role in electoral assistance, helping Iraq conduct multiple rounds of local and national elections.\n\nSecurity turnaround\n\nAmong UNAMI’s most significant legacies, Mr. Al Hassan said, is the dramatic improvement in security. He noted that Iraq “would have had no way to defeat Da’esh without the help of the United Nations and the international community” but emphasised that it was ultimately the courage and resilience of Iraqis that reversed the extremist group’s advances.\n\nThe country still feels the long-term impact of conflict. Roughly one million Iraqis remain internally displaced, including more than 100,000 Yazidis still living in camps after unimaginable suffering at the hands of Da’esh.\n\nUNAMI/Sarmad Al-Safy At Jeddah Rehabilitation Centre, Iraq, the UN Secretary-General met returnees from the Al-Hol camp in northeast Syria, where many Iraqi, Syrians, and third-country nationals – mainly women and children – remain stranded. (2023)\n\nMany remain unable to return home, particularly to the Yazidi heartland of Sinjar, due to destroyed infrastructure and unresolved security issues.\n\n“I hope they will have the time, the resources and the support to go back to the homes they were lifted from,” he said. “It’s about time.”\n\nA gender lens\n\nAdvancing the rights of women has been integral to UNAMI’s mandate, and Mr. Al Hassan said Iraq must continue that work long after the Mission departs.\n\n“Yes, Iraq today is much better than before on women’s rights,” he said. “But violence against women has unfortunately increased.”\n\nHe stressed that sustainable progress must come from within. “We want the Iraqis to be the sponsors and be advocates of women’s rights — through Iraqi law, Iraqi protection and Iraqi legislation,” he said. “At the end of the day is the protection of their own people”, Mr. Al Hassan added.\n\nA major pillar of UNAMI’s mandate has been the promotion of human rights, including support for judicial and legal reforms, protection of vulnerable communities, and advancing the rights of women and minorities.\n\nThese responsibilities have shaped the Mission’s work up to its planned closure in December 2025.\n\nAs Iraq prepares to take its seat on the UN Human Rights Council, he said the country “must act as such”, ensuring full protection for women, youth and minorities and safeguarding freedom of expression.\n\nUN presence remains in Iraq\n\nWhile the political mission will close, Mr. Al Hassan emphasised that the UN’s broader footprint will remain unchanged.\n\n“People confuse UNAMI with the United Nations,” he said. “All the specialised agencies – UNICEF, WHO, IOM, UNDP, and many others – will remain in Iraq. Even the World Bank and IMF are opening new offices.”\n\nWith significant oil reserves and a large GDP, Iraq is not seeking aid, he noted. “Iraq does not need charity; it needs the support and friendship of the international community.”\n\nOCHA/Themba Linden Humanitarian partners distribute emergency assistance in Ibrahim Khalil village in Iraq.\n\n‘Success story’ in a turbulent region\n\nCalling Iraq “a success story” and “a unique country”, Mr. Al Hassan urged the international community to give Iraq the space and support it needs to succeed.\n\n“My message to the international community and neighbouring countries is give Iraq a chance to prove themselves they are worthy of the freedom that Iraqis paid a very heavy price for.”\n\nUNAMI’s departure does not mark an end to the Iraq–UN partnership.\n\n“I have no doubt that the Iraqis have flipped the page to another beautiful one that will take their country into a better position than before”, Mr. Al Hassan said.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Since 2003, Iraq has faced major challenges including war, dictatorship, and attacks by the terrorist group ISIL. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) was set up to help the country recover and build peace.\n\n**What happened** – On December 31, 2025, UNAMI will officially end its work in Iraq after more than 20 years. The mission supported Iraq through political crises, security struggles, and multiple elections. UN Secretary-General António Guterres will visit Baghdad to mark this important moment.\n\n**Impact** – Ending the mission shows how much Iraq has improved. The country held its most fair and peaceful elections in November 2023, with over half of the people voting. Security has also gotten better, helping Iraq defeat ISIL. Despite challenges, such as many displaced people and ongoing risks, Iraq is now ready to take full control of its future. UNAMI also helped promote women’s rights, community healing, and legal reforms.\n\n**What's next step** – Although UNAMI’s political work ends, many UN agencies like UNICEF and WHO will stay in Iraq to continue supporting health, education, and development. Iraq is preparing to join the UN Human Rights Council, which will require the country to protect the rights of women, minorities, and young people. The international community is encouraged to keep supporting Iraq as it builds a peaceful and stable future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – After more than two decades of support, the UN’s mission in Iraq concludes as the country moves forward with stronger democracy, improved security, and ongoing efforts to protect human rights.",

      "summary": "In 2023, journalist Cong Corrales filed a landmark case against Meta to obtain the identities behind the accounts that had led a vicious smear operation against him.",
      "content": "This article is part of a series produced by IFEX, the global network defending and promoting freedom of expression, on the impact of the silence and inaction of Big Tech about the misuse of their platforms in amplifying attacks targeting journalists.\n\nThe Higaonon are an Indigenous group based in the mountainous regions of northern and central Mindanao, in the Philippines. They face serious challenges, notably the encroachment of mining and logging operations in their ancestral territories. In 2019, after Leonardo Vicente “Cong” Corrales wrote about the plight of Higaonon evacuees fleeing from military clashes in their communities, he found himself included in a poster of individuals tagged as alleged members of the Communist Party of the Philippines in Cagayan de Oro, which is designated by the Philippine government as a terrorist group. The producers of the poster, which circulated widely online, remained anonymous.\n\nThis is “red-tagging” — the practice of linking individuals and groups to the Communist Party and its armed wing. During Duterte’s presidency, red-tagging was used to target critics, journalists, scholars, the opposition, and human rights defenders. Professional journalists are mainly red-tagged by unknown perpetrators on social media platforms.\n\nDespite authorities’ insistence that there’s no such thing as red-tagging, an important Supreme Court ruling in 2024 described it as a threat to life and liberty. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) recently produced a study that showed that 60 percent of red-tagging incidents between 2016 and 2024 were perpetrated by state forces, particularly members of the police and military.\n\nSometimes the threats against Corrales were even more direct. In 2020, after expressing support for ABS-CBN, the country’s largest media broadcaster, which was forced to shut down after its franchise was not renewed (by a Congress dominated by allies of former President Rodrigo Duterte), he returned to the station to find a wreath had been placed there, with his name and the names of other journalists on it.\n\nIn 2021, after writing an article about a community pantry, Corrales was once again red-tagged by anonymous Facebook accounts spreading a photo of him carrying a gun and implying that he is an armed communist rebel. The gun was actually a toy used in a safety training seminar for journalists.\n\nIn 2023, a doxxing operation added fuel to the fire. An anonymous Facebook account uploaded information sheets of Corrales and another journalist extracted from a city government’s housing agency. The intent was to condemn critical journalists like Corrales for availing themselves of government services like socialized housing, implying that citizens should lose this right when they criticize authorities.\n\nIn 2023, he sent a letter to Meta, Facebook’s parent company, demanding the removal of posts that had been red-tagging him since 2019 and asking for information about the accounts behind these posts. In response, Meta said it had already taken down the posts, but insisted “it needed legal processes to comply with the request for information.”\n\nCorrales countered by filing a case before the National Privacy Commission (NPC) against Meta because of the latter’s refusal to provide information about the red-tagging accounts. He was backed by NUJP and volunteer lawyers from the Movement Against Disinformation, which vowed to pursue a “watershed litigation” against the red-taggers.\n\nJUST IN. Cagayan de Oro based journalist Cong Corrales @congcorrales files a complaint with the National Privacy Commission to compel Meta to disclose info about Cong's red-taggers. pic.twitter.com/n46pX22ubN — Bulatlat (@bulatlat) May 5, 2023\n\nIn July 2025, an arbitration facilitated by the NPC allowed Corrales and his legal team to access the identities of at least 10 of around 30 social media pages behind the red-tagging accounts. At least one of the accounts was traced to a government establishment. Corrales and his lawyers welcomed the decision as an important step forward in pursuing accountability and justice.\n\nIn an interview with IFEX, Corrales emphasized the moral and ethical responsibility of Meta and other social media platforms to protect their users.\n\nThey are no longer just neutral bulletin boards; they are now the primary battlegrounds for public discourse. By failing to act decisively, these platforms become unwitting accomplices to human rights abuses. The algorithms that are designed to maximize engagement can amplify dangerous narratives like red-tagging, which puts lives at risk.\n\nHe underscored the need for “legal pushback” to compel Meta to respond to his petition. “Without legal action, these platforms can easily ignore our pleas,” he said.\n\n“The legal route is not just about a single case; it’s about forcing a systemic change in how these platforms handle human rights issues,” he added.\n\nAs a way forward to combat red-tagging, Corrales urged the government to make a “clear, unequivocal condemnation of red-tagging by high-ranking officials” and ensure “the swift investigation and prosecution of individuals who spread disinformation and incite violence against journalists and rights advocates.”\n\nRegarding social media platforms like Meta, Corrales emphasized that creating a safer online environment is crucial to safeguarding democracy and the free press.\n\nThey should have stricter and more transparent content moderation policies specifically designed to address state-sponsored or coordinated disinformation campaigns. They need to be more responsive to user reports of threats, hate speech, harassment, and disinformation, especially when these come from state-affiliated sources. They must invest in local teams with a deep understanding of the sociopolitical context in the Philippines.\n\nFrom being the most red-tagged journalist in his region, Corrales fought back by invoking the responsibilities of tech platforms and government bodies to protect the safety of all internet users.",

This puts those targeted, especially journalists, at serious risk. Social media platforms like Facebook have often been used to spread these false accusations.\n\n**What happened** – In 2023, journalist Cong Corrales took legal action against Meta, the company that owns Facebook, to find out who was behind anonymous social media accounts that spread harmful lies about him. After years of attacks, including fake photos and personal information shared online, Corrales filed a case with the National Privacy Commission. In 2025, an arbitration decision allowed him to learn the identities of some of these accounts, with at least one linked to a government office.\n\n**Impact** – This case is important because it challenges how social media platforms handle harmful content and protects journalists from online harassment. It shows that legal action can hold big tech companies accountable and push them to be more responsible. Corrales’ success also highlights the role of social media in spreading dangerous false information and the need for better rules to protect people’s safety and freedom.\n\n**What's next step** – Corrales and his team plan to use the information they received to seek justice against those who spread lies and threats. He also calls on the government to strongly condemn red-tagging and investigate those responsible.

En 2025, une décision d'arbitrage lui a permis d'obtenir l'identité de certains de ces comptes, dont au moins un lié à un bureau gouvernemental.\n\n**Impact** – Cette affaire est importante car elle remet en cause la manière dont les plateformes sociales gèrent les contenus nuisibles et protège les journalistes du harcèlement en ligne. Elle montre que des actions juridiques peuvent rendre les grandes entreprises technologiques responsables et les pousser à avoir plus de responsabilités. Le succès de Corrales souligne aussi le rôle des réseaux sociaux dans la diffusion de fausses informations dangereuses et la nécessité de meilleures règles pour protéger la sécurité et la liberté des personnes.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Corrales et son équipe comptent utiliser les informations obtenues pour demander justice contre ceux qui répandent mensonges et menaces.

I mean, like we’ve been saying, all the busyness of the holidays is definitely catching up to me. And so, I encourage everyone, and myself, to make sure to slow down, make sure to show some gratitude, show some love to yourself, and to others as we wrap up another year.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, I’m pretty excited that my family will be arriving in just two days.

I hope the house is clean enough for my mom (laughs). But I guess we’ll just jump straight into our episode because we probably both have a lot to do. Well, I’m an Optimist, But… sometimes I find that there’s just not enough time to talk about all of the solutions we want to talk about. And I say this because I’m actually really excited about your solution, Karissa. So, I might put mine on the backburner and we’ll see if we have enough time to dive into it. But yeah, yours is just really, really interesting and timely.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah. And like you said, Arielle, it is a bummer we don’t get to talk about all the solutions here. But of course, you can go read more about them on our website. They’re always there for you. But without further ado, if you don’t mind, I would love to share my solution.\n\nArielle\n\nGo for it, go for it.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, like you said, this one is super timely. The solution is called Australia’s bold move to ban kids under 16 from social media sparks important global debates.\n\nThis week on December 10th, Australia became the first country to ban all children under 16 from having social media accounts. And I think it opens up such a fascinating conversation on whether a ban can be effective in a situation like this and what can be done in tandem or instead to protect kids on the internet.\n\nArielle\n\nA sweeping ban on social media for kids by an entire government is quite an ambitious move. Personally, I appreciate where this is coming from. We’ve published many articles on the negative effects of social media activity and what that does to mental health, not only for kids but adults too. And honestly, I think a blanket ban for people under 16 may not be the final solution for such a complex and nuanced issue, but it’s definitely a start, and it’s certainly caught the attention of other countries that are already working on improved regulations for online spaces.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, exactly. It’s such a wild west and there’s a lot to be discussed with this. But protecting kids, I think, is definitely one of the main concerns with these digital spaces. And this new policy is meant to be a sweeping law that covers these global digital spaces like TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Threads, and other popular platforms. But whether the move will meaningfully protect young people or just simply push them towards digital workarounds is still unclear. Sometimes on the Optimist Daily, we share solutions that haven’t been fully fleshed out, and this is certainly one of them that’s so open-ended. But I think it’s safe to say that the rest of the world is definitely watching closely and there will be a lot to learn in this experiment.\n\nArielle\n\nYes, digital and online spaces are really new to humanity when you think about it, but they also evolve so rapidly that it feels like there will always be a steep learning curve. I think any government that is concerned with the well-being of their citizens would be interested in… in taming social media in some way, especially for youth whose brains aren’t fully developed. But what’s led to Australia being the first one to take such a huge leap?\n\nKarissa\n\nWell, the ban follows a government-commissioned study released earlier this year that painted a pretty troubling picture of kids’ online lives. 96% of children aged 10 to 15 were using social media, which is crazy. That’s just about all of them. And 70% had been exposed to harmful content, including misogyny, violence, and material promoting suicide and eating disorders, which are not great. One in seven had been targeted by grooming behavior, and more than half reported being cyberbullied.\n\nArielle\n\nOh my gosh, when I hear these stats, I’m already terrified. And I can only imagine how parents of young children feel, not just in Australia either, because I’m sure these numbers aren’t far off from other places in the world. Parents and guardians have to balance all the risk that comes with an online existence while, I imagine, also respecting their growing children’s privacy and freedom of expression. So how do they juggle keeping kids safe while allowing them to communicate with their friends? There’s so many factors that parents and guardians have to grapple with in this digital age. It’s just super clear that something has to be done to also take some of that burden off of citizens’ shoulders.\n\nKarissa\n\nExactly, which is why the Australian government wants to do something about it and is why, you know, they cited these findings when introducing the ban because they accuse social media platforms of promoting design features that encourage young people to spend more time on screens while pushing content that can harm their health and well-being. And that’s not really a secret. That’s been a huge discussion for years since this has come about, but it’s time to finally do something.\n\nArielle\n\nSo, Karissa, can you explain how they’re going to attempt to make this ban work?\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, so children under 16 can no longer create or maintain social media accounts across 10 platforms, which include TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, and Twitch. Existing accounts must be deactivated, but kids can still watch most content passively, as the ban only blocks interactive accounts.\n\nArielle\n\nAnd who’s responsible for making sure kids under 16 don’t have their own social media accounts? Would a child or a parent face punishment for breaking this law?\n\nKarissa\n\nNo, the law doesn’t punish children or parents. Instead, the burden falls entirely on social media companies who must take reasonable steps to keep under 16s off their platform or face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars, which is about 32 million US dollars. So, pretty hefty fine, but maybe not enough (laughs). And to comply, companies must implement age assurance technology that goes beyond simple self-declared birthdays, because that’s kind of what’s already in place right now, you know. And that may include government ID checks, facial or voice recognition, or advanced algorithms that infer a user’s age based on online behavior.\n\nArielle\n\nWell, these kids have grown up with tech. Most of them are more adept at navigating these hurdles than many adults I know. And I bet that some of these Australian kids are already working on workarounds. Plus, a lot of kids, even over the age of 16, don’t have government IDs, right? I didn’t get my first government ID until I got my driver’s license. And then there are issues with how reliable these verification systems are, et cetera.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, critics are worrying that the rollout may backfire because also facial recognition is notoriously unreliable for teens. And many fear the law will even block adults by mistake while letting determined underage users slip through. And then, like you said, of course, Arielle too. I mean, a lot of people don’t even have like a government ID at that age. I barely did at 16 too. So, there’s a lot of things that could go wrong with this.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah. Or I guess I had my passport, but then again, like, not everyone has a passport.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle\n\nAnd then not to mention all the privacy concerns.\n\nKarissa\n\nYes.\n\nArielle\n\nThere’s been so many data breaches that any kind of data collection would be concerning for underage kids, but especially biometric and other sensitive data. So, my guess is that not all families would be okay with this.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah. I mean, critics actually flagged this point, especially in a country where data breaches have exposed sensitive personal information in recent years. And I mean, in a world, honestly, because I know in the United States that happens all the time.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah.\n\nKarissa\n\nThe government insists the legislation includes strong data protections. Information collected can only be used for age verification and must be deleted immediately after. But of course, you know, data breaches are going to happen and they’re all too common.\n\nArielle\n\nKarissa, I want to back up a bit to the fines that these social media companies would have to pay if or when they violate this ban. These are multi-billion, even trillion-dollar companies. How much of a deterrent would these fines even be to them?\n\nKarissa\n\nThat’s a great point too, because actually Stephen Scheeler, who is a former Facebook executive, questioned the effectiveness of the fines as well. And he said that it takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million USD in revenue. And we just mentioned that like the max fine would be $32 million. So,they can pay that easily, like in an hour, in two hours.\n\nAnd besides this only being a drop in the bucket, the ban has some other major loopholes which allow other companies to get through the cracks as well. Because dating apps, gaming platforms, and AI chatbots, some of which have been flagged for predatory or sexually suggestive behavior, are not covered by the ban. And popular gaming platforms for kids like Roblox or Discord are also excluded, although they have been working on introducing more age restrictions. And you know, those are huge digital gathering places for kids as well.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, I mean, as you said, it’s like the wild, wild west or the final frontier. It’s all new. And there are so many weak points and workarounds that would allow children to basically do what they please on other platforms in the digital world, regardless of this particular ban. And probably with even less oversight and regulation.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, exactly. I mean, even teens themselves seem pretty skeptical of all this because some admitted that they’re setting up fake accounts, switching to shared family profiles, or planning to use VPNs to mask their age and location.\n\nI came about on the internet when things were still developing, like social media was relatively new. Everyone having a smartphone was relatively new as well. But I had easy access to my mom’s phone. So, I’m sure like even for me, I can imagine that I just would have been able to like even just go on her phone if that’s what it came to.\n\nAnd these tactics already were used in the UK because similar laws were enacted under the Online Safety Act of 2023, which didn’t like come with a full ban, but it definitely had some more restrictions on kids being on these social platforms. But you know, we’re already seeing that they’re able to work around it.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, I also wonder how much dialogue the Australian government has had with the very people that this ban will affect. And when I say that, I don’t necessarily mean the companies, but the actual children and parents who will be navigating these changes on the ground. I know that unregulated social media can affect any brain negatively, no matter the age, but there are also positive aspects to finding community online.\n\nLike, let’s say, youth with marginalized identities who may feel isolated in their small hometowns, for instance. Also, there’s educational content or even the chance to develop media literacy skills. I know that there are also a lot of content creators who are under the age of 16 who are already running businesses and making money for, I don’t know, university or whatever via their social media accounts.\n\nSo regardless of personal opinions on whether children should already have online businesses, the fact is that some of them have put in a lot of work into building something lucrative, and then to kick them off these platforms could feel pretty unfair to them.\n\nKarissa\n\nI’m kind of thinking back to when Slime was a major thing and a lot of, kid like content creators and kind of business owners who are probably in this like younger age of the teenage spectrum were the ones behind these businesses like making Slime or something like that.\n\nAnd it could be a good thing too, you know, they’re raising money for themselves for their futures and their audience is also going to be like younger people. So, you know, you’re losing an entire audience, an entire community. So, it just makes me wonder is, like you were saying, is taking away access to social media for most of their teen years too limiting of their expression and freedom?\n\nFor better or for worse, I joined social media when I was around 12 years old. And like I said, this is when like social media was kind of like coming about more presently. These huge like companies were really starting to get their footing on the ground, like Facebook and Instagram and stuff, which are still like the leading giants. So that was when these negative consequences were pretty like widely unknown. But we can’t just say social media and the online world is entirely bad for any age, honestly.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, no, I wouldn’t say it is. But thinking about how screens are so baked into children’s lives does make me sad. And it makes me wonder how much of the “real world” they’re missing out on. I remember watching that Netflix documentary a few years back called… what was it called? The Social Dilemma. Have you seen it?\n\nKarissa\n\nNo, but I remember everybody was talking about it.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, there were interviews with former designers and execs from companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest, et cetera, talking about how these platforms are engineered to be addictive. And several of these big shots in these companies mentioned that they don’t let their own kids anywhere near social media or let them have smartphones or unrestricted screens, which I think is super telling. But then again, this digital screen-saturated reality is what the world has become, and perhaps… the conversation should really be more about learning how to wield social media safely and fairly, both from the company side and from the users at any age.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, exactly. I think it kind of also opens up the broader conversation of who is responsible for making sure the digital landscape is safe. Because is it the government? Is it these companies? Which I think, you know, is it the families? Is it the kids themselves? I think it should be a mix of all of these factors. And, is a full band the complete answer? I don’t know.\n\nArielle, I just wanted to go back and touch on how you’re talking about these social spaces can be a place for development as well. I don’t think I would have been exposed to so many opinions and like the realities of life if I wasn’t on social media at a young age. I entered the digital sphere as a preteen. And from a young age, it connected me to, causes that I am now like pretty passionate about. I would say it formed my political views and values from being a teen on Twitter and Tumblr. When Donald Trump first became a presidential candidate in 2016, there was a lot of discussion that I wouldn’t have even been exposed to. I don’t think like if I didn’t have that space. You know, also just in terms of expression too, like developing your identity and a lot of that these days can be online.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, I hear you. The online world can be a playground for kids to explore their passions and for them to get comfortable early on with tools they will certainly have to use in their adult lives. Yeah. But actually what you said about political views and everything… the shaping of ideology via the internet could also be very easily weaponized if not regulated carefully.\n\nKarissa\n\nYes.\n\nArielle\n\nAnd if that power is placed in the hands of those who only have their best interests and agendas in mind, I don’t know… that freaks me out. Social media and data companies today know us so intimately through tracking our behavior, and… I don’t know… at that point, the relationship we have with it, I feel, can be and probably is quite exploitative, like using our own identities, our deepest fears and desires to extract money from us without our permission is just… it gives me the creeps.\n\nKarissa\n\nI know. Yeah, it gives me the creeps too. And I mean, like you’re saying, like there can be good and bad, like, use that can be shaped. A huge discussion right now too is the male loneliness epidemic that has been formed from these spaces online that are pretty, I would say negative, I’m sorry, but like really bad for society and taking so many steps backwards. And this can go for, you know, not just like the male loneliness epidemic, but so many other things too, just like hateful… it could be a place of connection. It could be like connection for good causes or for hateful causes as well.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah. Well, back to Australia’s social media ban specifically. While we discussed many of its weak points, and let’s call them areas of improvement, I do think that they’ve made a seriously brave move in being the first country to do something about this and open up the conversation at a global level.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, exactly. I mean, the rollout is going to be imperfect. And as Communications Minister Annika Wells even admitted, you know, this rollout will not be flawless. She says it’s going to look a bit untidy on the way through. Big reforms always do, which is so true. But the government maintains that doing something is better than doing nothing, which I agree with.\n\nArielle\n\nYes, we have to start somewhere, and we just have to accept that it’s going to be a lot of trial and error. We’ve opened up Pandora’s box with the internet and social media without knowing what’s on the other side. And we cannot go back in time… yet. That much is clear. So, the solution or solutions to this multifaceted global problem won’t be simple, and it’s going to take a lot of collaboration across the board.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, Australia is taking a great step here, and it’s out of a place for concern for their citizens, of course. And the rest of the world is also, you know, taking similar steps as well. It’s really encouraging to hear that Denmark has announced a similar under 15 ban. Again, will a ban work? Who knows? And I mean, France is debating a curfew for teens on social media, so that could be something effective as well. Spain and Norway are exploring new restrictions. And like we mentioned earlier, the UK took action with their 2023 Online Safety Act. And also in the UK, companies now face major fines or even jail time for executives if they fail to prevent kids from accessing harmful content. So that’s a pretty bold step as well.\n\nSo, there is action around the world, but there’s definitely not a straightforward path quite yet in protecting kids online. And something that we kind of touched on earlier too is that this space is here to stay, the Pandora’s box is open, and it’s going to be ever-changing too. This is just something that’s going to have to keep evolving.\n\nArielle\n\nI am so curious to find out which solutions will be the most effective and fair, and whether corporations can set aside their concerns with monetary gain in favor of what’s actually good for humanity, especially concerning the well-being of younger generations.\n\nKarissa\n\nRight, exactly. So maybe a ban is the answer, or maybe it isn’t. And that’s why open-ended solutions like this one are fascinating to examine and also a reason for optimism, even if they haven’t solved an entire issue quite yet. It opens up the door for more discussion and more improvement on a very complex and nuanced issue that will continue to evolve.\n\nArielle\n\nWell, I’m sure other governments will be inspired to make some serious moves or will at least be watching to see what happens with Australia before making any big decisions. I know we at the Optimist Daily will be following this space closely.\n\nKarissa\n\nAnd we are interested in what our listeners think of this ban. First, I mean, who is responsible for online safety for kids? Is it the government, the companies, or families? Is age 16 too harsh of a ban? Is it too much, too little? Are there other things that you think governments, families, or schools could do to help protect children online? E-mail us your thoughts at Social@OptimistDaily.com or send us a message on socials even and let us know.\n\nArielle\n\nYes, we are so curious what all you forward-thinking solutions-focused people have in mind when it comes to this issue. So don’t be shy, share your hot takes with us, and on that note, I think we did talk quite a lot about this one. Maybe we’ll save my solution for another time. What do you think, Karissa?\n\nKarissa\n\nI think so. And I mean, like we said, all these solutions are available on OptimistDaily.com. And yeah, some of the ones that we included this week are.\n\nArielle\n\nGift shopping for a loved one with cancer this holiday season? Here’s what actually helps.

      "summary": "Record-high level of support for the integration of the region into the EU.",
      "content": "BRUSSELS – Citizens of the Western Balkans, 64 percent of them, support EU membership, which is the highest percentage since 2015 and an increase of 10 percent compared to last year, according to the Balkan Barometer 2025 presented today. In the Barometer prepared by the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC), rising prices and inflation remain the main concern for 66 percent of citizens, while 64 percent of citizens are convinced that regional cooperation can improve the economic situation.\n\nIt is also stated that 68 percent of young people are thinking about working or living abroad, 71 percent believe that EU membership would be good for their economy, which is the highest level of confidence among young people in the last five years. Also, according to the RCC statement, businesses have also reported concrete benefits from deeper regional integration, including reduced operating costs resulting from the roaming-free regime and expected gains from travel within the region with an ID card. RCC Secretary General Amer Kapetanović said at the presentation of the Barometer in Brussels that this year the citizens of the Western Balkans sent a clear message – that when real progress happens, trust follows.\n\n“Support for EU integration is at a record high, and confidence in regional cooperation remains steadily strong. People recognize the value of practical results, from fewer obstacles and lower costs to better connectivity and new opportunities for young people and businesses. It is our responsibility to preserve this momentum and turn it into concrete reforms and tangible benefits for everyone in the region,” said Kapetanović.\n\nHe recalled that next week EU and Western Balkan leaders will gather in Brussels, and that the findings of the Balkan Barometer could serve as a compass for that summit. “For the Western Balkans, this summit is an opportunity to show that the European path is not theoretical or seasonal, but credible. And credibility, as the Balkan Barometer shows, changes perspectives. When we look at the whole picture, citizens, businesses, institutions, young people, a simple truth emerges. People in the Western Balkans are not asking for miracles. They are asking for results. They reward progress with trust. They believe in Europe when Europe believes in them,” said Kapetanović. The Balkan Barometer is the most comprehensive regional review of public and business opinion across the Western Balkans. (11 December)",

C’est le niveau de soutien le plus élevé depuis 2015 et 10 % de plus que l’année dernière. Le sondage révèle aussi que 68 % des jeunes envisagent de vivre ou de travailler à l’étranger, et 71 % d’entre eux pensent que l’adhésion à l’UE serait bénéfique pour l’économie.\n\n**Impact** – Ce soutien élevé est important car il montre que beaucoup de personnes dans la région croient que rejoindre l’UE apportera de vrais avantages, comme de meilleurs emplois, des voyages facilités et des coûts réduits pour les entreprises. Par exemple, les entreprises ont déjà économisé grâce à la suppression des frais d’itinérance téléphonique dans la région. Cette confiance croissante signifie que les gens sont prêts pour une coopération plus forte et des réformes qui peuvent améliorer la vie quotidienne.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – La semaine prochaine, les dirigeants de l’UE et des Balkans occidentaux se réuniront à Bruxelles pour discuter de l’avenir de la région. Les résultats de ce sondage aideront à orienter leurs discussions. Cette rencontre est une occasion de transformer le soutien public en actions concrètes, comme de nouveaux accords et politiques facilitant l’adhésion à l’UE.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – Un record de 64 % des citoyens des Balkans occidentaux soutient l’adhésion à l’UE, montrant une confiance grandissante et un espoir d’amélioration des opportunités économiques et sociales grâce à la coopération régionale.",
