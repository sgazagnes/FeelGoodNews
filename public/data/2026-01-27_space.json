      "title": "The early universe supercharged black hole growth",
      "summary": "Astronomers may have finally cracked one of the universe’s biggest mysteries: how black holes grew so enormous so fast after the Big Bang. New simulations show that early, chaotic galaxies created perfect conditions for small “baby” black holes to go on extreme growth spurts, devouring gas at astonishing rates. These feeding frenzies allowed modest black holes—once thought too puny to matter—to balloon into monsters tens of thousands of times the Sun’s mass.",
      "content": "One of astronomy's longest standing puzzles has been understanding how black holes grew so large in such a short span of cosmic time. Scientists have long known that supermassive black holes existed surprisingly early in the universe, but how they reached those enormous sizes remained unclear. Now, researchers at Ireland's Maynooth University (MU) report a breakthrough explanation in a new study published in Nature Astronomy.\n\nAccording to the team, the answer lies in the extreme and chaotic conditions of the early universe.\n\n\"We found that the chaotic conditions that existed in the early Universe triggered early, smaller black holes to grow into the super-massive black holes we see later following a feeding frenzy which devoured material all around them,\" says Daxal Mehta, a PhD candidate in Maynooth University's Department of Physics and lead author of the study.\n\nRapid Growth After the Big Bang\n\nUsing advanced computer simulations, the researchers reconstructed how the first black holes behaved shortly after they formed.\n\n\"We revealed, using state-of-the-art computer simulations, that the first generation of black holes - those born just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang -- grew incredibly fast, into tens of thousands of times the size of our Sun.\"\n\nThese results help explain puzzling observations made by the James Webb Space Telescope, which has detected massive black holes existing far earlier than many theories predicted.\n\n\"This breakthrough unlocks one of astronomy's big puzzles,\" says Dr. Lewis Prole, a postdoctoral fellow at MU and member of the research team. \"That being how black holes born in the early Universe, as observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, managed to reach such super-massive sizes so quickly.\"\n\nA Black Hole Feeding Frenzy\n\nThe simulations point to dense, gas-rich early galaxies as the key driver of this rapid growth. In these environments, black holes experienced brief but intense growth spurts through a process known as 'super Eddington accretion'. This happens when a black hole pulls in matter faster than conventional physics suggests it should be able to.\n\nUnder normal conditions, radiation from the infalling material would push gas away. In the early universe, however, black holes somehow continued feeding despite this limit, allowing them to gain mass at extraordinary rates.\n\nThis process appears to provide a long missing connection between the universe's first stars and the supermassive black holes seen later at the centers of galaxies.\n\nRethinking Black Hole Origins\n\n\"These tiny black holes were previously thought to be too small to grow into the behemoth black holes observed at the centre of early galaxies,\" says Daxal Mehta. \"What we have shown here is that these early black holes, while small, are capable of growing spectacularly fast, given the right conditions.\"\n\nAstronomers classify early black holes into two general categories known as 'heavy seed and 'light seed' types. Light seed black holes begin with relatively modest masses, ranging from about ten to a few hundred times the mass of our Sun. To become supermassive, they must grow dramatically over time, eventually reaching millions of solar masses.\n\nHeavy seed black holes, by contrast, are thought to form already large, potentially weighing up to one hundred thousand times the mass of the Sun at birth.\n\nChallenging Longstanding Assumptions\n\nUntil now, many scientists believed that only heavy seed black holes could explain the presence of supermassive black holes in the early universe.\n\n\"Now we're not so sure,\" says Dr. John Regan of MU's Physics Department and leader of the research group. \"Heavy seeds are somewhat more exotic and may need rare conditions to form. Our simulations show that your 'garden variety' stellar mass black holes can grow at extreme rates in the early Universe.\"\n\nThe findings suggest that the early cosmos was far more turbulent and productive when it came to forming massive black holes than previously assumed.\n\n\"The early Universe is much more chaotic and turbulent than we expected, with a much larger population of massive black holes than we anticipated too,\" says Dr. Regan.\n\nImplications for Future Space Missions\n\nBeyond reshaping theories of black hole formation, the research also has implications for upcoming space observatories. In particular, it could influence what scientists expect to see from the joint European Space Agency-NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, scheduled for launch in 2035.\n\n\"Future gravitational wave observations from that mission may be able to detect the mergers of these tiny, early, rapidly growing baby black holes,\" says Dr. Regan.\n\nSuch detections would offer a powerful new way to study the universe's earliest black holes and confirm whether these rapid growth scenarios played out as the simulations suggest.",

      "content": "Containing nearly 800,000 galaxies, this image from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is overlaid with a map of dark matter, represented in blue. Researchers used Webb data to find the invisible substance via its gravitational influence on regular matter. NASA/STScI/J. DePasquale/A. Pagan\n\nWith the Webb telescope’s unprecedented sensitivity, scientists are learning more about dark matter’s influence on stars, galaxies, and even planets like Earth.\n\nScientists using data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have made one of the most detailed, high-resolution maps of dark matter ever produced. It shows how the invisible, ghostly material overlaps and intertwines with “regular” matter, the stuff that makes up stars, galaxies, and everything we can see.\n\nPublished Monday, Jan. 26, in Nature Astronomy, the map builds on previous research to provide additional confirmation and new details about how dark matter has shaped the universe on the largest scales — galaxy clusters millions of light-years across — that ultimately give rise to galaxies, stars, and planets like Earth.\n\n“This is the largest dark matter map we’ve made with Webb, and it’s twice as sharp as any dark matter map made by other observatories,” said Diana Scognamiglio, lead author of the paper and an astrophysicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “Previously, we were looking at a blurry picture of dark matter. Now we’re seeing the invisible scaffolding of the universe in stunning detail, thanks to Webb’s incredible resolution.”\n\nCreated using data from NASA’s Webb telescope in 2026 (right) and from the Hubble Space Telescope in 2007 (left), these images show the presence of dark matter in the same region of sky. Webb’s higher resolution is providing new insights into how this invisible component influences the distribution of ordinary matter in the universe. NASA/STScI/A. Pagan Dense regions of dark matter are connected by lower-density filaments, forming a weblike structure known as the cosmic web. This pattern appears more clearly in the Webb data than in the earlier Hubble image. Ordinary matter, including galaxies, tends to trace this same underlying structure shaped by dark matter. NASA/STScI/A. Pagan Some dark matter structures appear smaller in the Webb data because they are coming into sharper focus. Webb’s higher resolution also makes it possible to better confine the size and location of the dark matter clusters in the lower left of the image. NASA/STScI/A. Pagan\n\nDark matter doesn’t emit, reflect, absorb, or even block light, and it passes through regular matter like a ghost. But it does interact with the universe through gravity, something the map shows with a new level of clarity. Evidence for this interaction lies in the degree of overlap between dark matter and regular matter. According to the paper’s authors, Webb’s observations confirm that this close alignment can’t be a coincidence but, rather, is due to dark matter’s gravity pulling regular matter toward it throughout cosmic history.\n\n“Wherever we see a big cluster of thousands of galaxies, we also see an equally massive amount of dark matter in the same place. And when we see a thin string of regular matter connecting two of those clusters, we see a string of dark matter as well,” said Richard Massey, an astrophysicist at Durham University in the United Kingdom and a coauthor of the new study. “It’s not just that they have the same shapes. This map shows us that dark matter and regular matter have always been in the same place. They grew up together.”\n\nCloser look\n\nFound in the constellation Sextans, the area covered by the new map is a section of sky about 2.5 times larger than the full Moon. A global community of scientists have observed this region with at least 15 ground- and space-based telescopes for the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). Their goal: to precisely measure the location of regular matter here and then compare it to the location of dark matter. The first dark matter map of the area was made in 2007 using data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, a project led by Massey and JPL astrophysicist Jason Rhodes, a coauthor of the paper.\n\nWebb peered at this region for a total of about 255 hours and identified nearly 800,000 galaxies, some of which were detected for the first time. Scognamiglio and her colleagues then looked for dark matter by observing how its mass curves space itself, which in turn bends the light traveling to Earth from distant galaxies. When observed by researchers, it’s as if the light of those galaxies has passed through a warped windowpane.\n\nThe Webb map contains about 10 times more galaxies than maps of the area made by ground-based observatories and twice as many as Hubble’s. It reveals new clumps of dark matter and captures a higher-resolution view of the areas previously seen by Hubble.\n\nTo refine measurements of the distance to many galaxies for the map, the team used Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), designed and managed through launch by JPL, along with other space- and ground-based telescopes. The wavelengths that MIRI detects also make it adept at detecting galaxies obscured by cosmic dust clouds.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nWhen the universe began, regular matter and dark matter were probably sparsely distributed. Scientists think dark matter began to clump together first and that those dark matter clumps then pulled together regular matter, creating regions with enough material for stars and galaxies to begin to form.\n\nIn this way, dark matter determined the large-scale distribution of galaxies in the universe. And by prompting galaxy and star formation to begin earlier than they would have otherwise, dark matter’s influence also played a role in creating the conditions for planets to eventually form. That’s because the first generations of stars were responsible for turning hydrogen and helium — which made up the vast majority of atoms in the early universe — into the rich array of elements that now compose planets like Earth. In other words, dark matter provided more time for complex planets to form.\n\n“This map provides stronger evidence that without dark matter, we might not have the elements in our galaxy that allowed life to appear,” said Rhodes. “Dark matter is not something we encounter in our everyday life on Earth, or even in our solar system, but it has definitely influenced us.”\n\nScognamiglio and some of her coauthors will also map dark matter with NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope over an area 4,400 times bigger than the COSMOS region. Roman’s primary science goals include learning more about dark matter’s fundamental properties and how they may or may not have changed over cosmic history. But Roman’s maps won’t beat Webb’s spatial resolution. More detailed looks at dark matter will be possible only with a next-generation telescope like the Habitable Worlds Observatory, NASA’s next astrophysics flagship concept.\n\nMore about Webb\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it.

      "content": "Despite its small size, Mars seems to have a huge impact on the orbital cycles that govern Earth’s climate, especially those that cause ice ages\n\nMars has a surprisingly large influence on Earth’s climate NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems\n\nCompared with Earth, Mars is tiny, yet it seems to have an outsized effect on our planet’s climate cycles. Similar small planets could affect the climates of worlds beyond our solar system, which we must begin to take into account when evaluating their potential habitability.\n\nStephen Kane at the University of California, Riverside, and his colleagues found this effect by running simulations of the influence Mars would have on Earth’s orbit if it were a different mass, from 100 times its actual mass to if it were gone entirely. “I came to this from a perspective of scepticism, actually, because I had trouble believing that Mars, which is only a tenth the mass of Earth, could have such a profound effect on Earth’s cycles, so that’s what motivated this study to turn that knob of Mars’s mass and see what happens,” says Kane.\n\nEarth’s climate has many long-scale cycles based on the eccentricity of its orbit – how stretched out its path around the sun is – and the tilt of its axis. These orbits, governed by the gravity of the sun and the other planets in the solar system, govern such crucial events as the timing of ice ages and the intensity of seasonal changes.\n\nOne of the most influential is known as the grand cycle: over the course of 2.4 million years, the ellipse of Earth’s orbit around the sun elongates and shortens again. This affects how much sunlight Earth’s surface gets at any given time, regulating the timing of long-term changes in climate.\n\nThe researchers found that when Mars was removed entirely, the grand cycle disappeared, along with another cycle in Earth’s eccentricity that lasts about 100,000 years. “It’s not to say that if we removed Mars then Earth wouldn’t have ice ages, but it would change that whole landscape of the frequency at which ice ages and related climate effects are occurring,” says Kane.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nWhen Mars’s simulated mass was increased, these cycles became shorter and more intense. But a third eccentricity cycle lasting about 405,000 years, which is governed mainly by the gravitational pulls of Venus and Jupiter, remained regardless of Mars’s mass, so the Red Planet isn’t all-powerful, but it is more influential than anyone expected.\n\nA more subtle effect is Mars’s influence on Earth’s tilt, which normally wobbles back and forth over a period of about 41,000 years. Kane and his colleagues found that Mars seems to have a stabilising effect on this cycle, with it occurring less frequently if Mars had extra mass and more frequently if Mars got smaller.\n\nWe can’t say exactly what Earth would be like if Mars weren’t there or if it were much larger in size, but there would certainly be some changes. As the search continues for Earth-like worlds with a climate suitable for life as we know it, it seems the influence of smaller planets is larger than scientists realised. “We really need to know the orbital architectures of exoplanet systems really well to be able to reasonably have a grasp on the possible climate fluctuations on those planets,” says Sean Raymond at the University of Bordeaux in France.\n\nUnderstanding that architecture will be tough, though. “This is more of a warning than anything else: we can’t ignore the smaller objects, even though they are quite difficult to find, because those smaller planets like Mars are really having a bigger impact than we thought,” says Kane.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Earth’s climate changes over thousands of years, with ice ages coming and going. These changes are partly caused by how Earth moves around the sun, including the shape of its orbit and the tilt of its axis. Scientists know that the gravity of other planets affects these movements.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of California, Riverside, studied how Mars’s gravity influences Earth’s orbit and climate cycles. They used computer simulations to see what would happen if Mars were much heavier, much lighter, or completely missing. They found that Mars’s presence helps create important cycles in Earth’s orbit that control when ice ages happen.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows that even a small planet like Mars has a big effect on Earth’s long-term climate. Without Mars, some key cycles, including the “grand cycle” of 2.4 million years, would disappear. This means Mars helps shape the timing and intensity of ice ages. The finding also matters for studying planets outside our solar system, as small nearby planets might similarly affect their climates.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will use this new understanding to better study the orbits of planets in other solar systems. Knowing how smaller planets affect climate cycles will help decide which distant planets might have stable climates suitable for life. More detailed observations of these systems will be needed to learn about their orbital arrangements.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Mars’s gravity plays a surprising but important role in controlling Earth’s ice age cycles and offers new insights for studying climates on other planets.",

Ces changements sont en partie causés par la façon dont la Terre se déplace autour du soleil, notamment la forme de son orbite et l’inclinaison de son axe. On sait que la gravité des autres planètes influence ces mouvements.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs de l’Université de Californie à Riverside ont étudié comment la gravité de Mars influence l’orbite de la Terre et ses cycles climatiques. Ils ont utilisé des simulations informatiques pour voir ce qui arriverait si Mars était beaucoup plus lourde, beaucoup plus légère, ou complètement absente. Ils ont découvert que la présence de Mars aide à créer des cycles importants dans l’orbite de la Terre qui contrôlent le moment des âges glaciaires.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte montre qu’une petite planète comme Mars a un grand effet sur le climat à long terme de la Terre. Sans Mars, certains cycles clés, dont le « grand cycle » de 2,4 millions d’années, disparaîtraient. Cela signifie que Mars aide à définir le rythme et l’intensité des âges glaciaires. Cette découverte est aussi importante pour étudier les planètes en dehors de notre système solaire, car des petites planètes proches pourraient influencer leur climat de la même façon.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques utiliseront cette nouvelle compréhension pour mieux étudier les orbites des planètes dans d’autres systèmes solaires. Savoir comment les petites planètes affectent les cycles climatiques aidera à décider quelles planètes lointaines pourraient avoir un climat stable adapté à la vie.
