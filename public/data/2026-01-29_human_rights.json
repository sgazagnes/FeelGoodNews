      "title": "How to turn Africa’s young demographic potential into a collective power",
      "summary": "The African youth, an exploding population, needs support and programs to turn their potential into economic power.",
      "content": "In public spaces, transport, and the media, we see the challenges facing an increasingly elderly population: increased healthcare needs, failure to adapt infrastructure, public transport, and housing to help maintain their independence. A few weeks ago, I travelled to Japan, where I saw firsthand how the aging population isn’t just an abstract statistic.\n\nIn 2023, the Japanese population had a life expectancy of over 80 for both men and women, with those over 65 accounting for 29 percent of the population, and those under 15 accounting for 11 percent. Comparatively, for the same time period in Senegal, those over 65 accounted for 3.8 percent of the population, and those under 15 accounted for 39 percent.\n\nIn Japan, in addition to this observation, I witnessed the effective social and spatial adaptation of infrastructure and services to support this age group: infrastructure designed for limited mobility, health devices, jobs dedicated to elder care, and even the use of technology to aid them in their daily tasks.\n\nHowever, in Africa, we tend to hear more about the population boom. After all, this continent now has the world’s youngest population. According to a UNICEF report published in 2023, by 2050, Africa will account for around 41 percent of all global births — about 40 percent of all children under five, and 35 percent of all adolescents. This young population has the potential to be a massive force for change.\n\nPromising initiatives to combat major challenges\n\nWhen young people are supported, they demonstrate their independence and innovation. Such is the case in Kenya, where the Nairobi technology hubs power the “Silicon Savannah,” and in Tunisia, where the startup ecosystem is integrated into public employment policies. In Rwanda, the investment policy in digital technology and services has reduced young graduate unemployment by almost 10 percent over the past decade\n\nHowever, as education remains a privilege, this potential is largely underutilized. According to UNESCO, more than 98 million school-aged children and young people are out of school in Sub-Saharan Africa. For 15- to 17-year-olds, the school dropout rate exceeds 50 percent, including in technical courses, and is even higher for girls. As such, millions of young people leave the system without the necessary skills to become agents of development.\n\nOnly strong political will can reverse that trend, as shown in Ghana, where the Free Senior High School program, combining free access, scholarship policies, and facility improvements, increased secondary school enrolment by 69 percent between 2017 and 2022.\n\nIncompatibility between training and employment\n\nSustainable development cannot be limited to access to education; it is still necessary to utilize the acquired skills. Many African education systems remain out of touch with the labor market needs. Technical, vocational, and digital education remains inadequate and often undervalued.\n\nThe consequences are clear. Every year, 10 to 12 million young people enter the African labor market, but only 3.7 million formal jobs are created. Many turn to informal employment, with precarious incomes and no social protection. This lack of productivity hampers growth, weakens social cohesion, and often fuels migration.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, more than 92 percent of workers in Nigeria are now part of the informal work industry. This percentage is even greater among young people. In a study by the International Labor Organization (ILO), 98 percent of employed young men and 99 percent of employed young women report being in informal employment.\n\nIn South Africa, informal employment accounts for a significant segment of the economy. According to trade unions, this sector accounts for around 27 percent of the workforce.\n\nHowever, alternatives exist. In Somalia, social entrepreneur and Aspen Institute member Mohamed Ali Dini founded the IFTIN Foundation. This program trains and employs young people, offering them mental health support to overcome the trauma of war and reintegrate into society. This type of integrated approach — employment, health, and resilience — exemplifies how Africa can transform its young people into agents of reconstruction.\n\nAmong these young people, girls are the ones who experience multiple forms of discrimination: limited access to education, child marriages, teenage pregnancies, and sexual abuse. According to UNICEF, more than one in eight girls in Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a form of sexual abuse during childhood.\n\nAnd yet, young women are powerful agents of change. In Senegal, initiatives like Senegaleses in Tech or Jokalante train hundreds of young women in digital and coding professions. These often civil-society-led programs show that investing in women’s education and economic independence has a positive effect on society as a whole: higher incomes, reduced inequalities, improved health, and family stability. Empowering young women is, therefore, a key sustainable development strategy.\n\nThe African Development Bank’s (AfDB) projections indicate that Africa’s working population will increase from about 56 percent to 63 percent by 2050. If this transition is well managed, it could become a source of prosperity. But without massive investment in education, health, training, and formal employment, this advantage could become a disadvantage: a large but marginalized youth population.\n\nSome countries have shown the way. In Ethiopia, the Youth Revolving Fund has funded over 200,000 youth entrepreneurial projects since 2019. When built on a coherent national vision, these programs can sustainably reduce youth unemployment and rebuild social trust.\n\nWell-defined development priorities\n\nVarious strategies are required to put this potential into force. The first step involves fundamentally reforming education systems to meet the current needs of local economies. The programs must include digital skills, green occupations, sustainable agriculture, craftsmanship, and small business management. Ensuring universal access to secondary education, especially for girls, requires targeted scholarships, appropriate infrastructure, and local education policies.\n\nSecondly, it is vital to create decent jobs that offer young people tangible prospects. This means supporting entrepreneurship with accessible funding mechanisms, mentorship, and greater integration in local and regional markets. Governments and partners must also foster investments in growing sectors, such as technology, light industry, and renewable energy.\n\nHealth and social protection are another indispensable asset. Youth policies must include reproductive health, mental health, and social security. Particular attention should also be paid to the protection of young women from violence and discrimination, which hinders their economic and social participation.\n\nLastly, youth participation and leadership must be central to public action. Young people, and young women in particular, must be included in decision-making spaces on all levels: local, national, and regional. Fostering inclusive leadership, rooted in community realities, is a prerequisite for building resilient and equitable societies.\n\nI often think back on what I saw in Japan, an aging society that, paradoxically, values young people as a rare commodity. There, they want more young people, they look for them, train them, and listen to them. In Africa, we have the opposite, an abundance of young people who are rarely valued. We have the world’s greatest demographic treasure, and yet we don’t make it a priority.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Africa has the youngest population in the world, with a large number of children and teenagers. This contrasts with countries like Japan, where many people are elderly. While Africa’s young people have great potential, many face challenges like limited access to education and jobs.\n\n**What happened** – Several African countries have started programs to help young people succeed. For example, Kenya’s technology hubs support young innovators, Tunisia integrates startups into job policies, and Rwanda’s focus on digital skills has lowered youth unemployment. In Ghana, free secondary education has helped more students stay in school. Meanwhile, organizations like Somalia’s IFTIN Foundation train youth and provide mental health support.\n\n**Impact** – These efforts show that when young people get education, skills, and support, they can drive economic growth and social progress. Young women, often facing extra challenges, are becoming leaders through programs that teach digital skills. Without these efforts, many young Africans end up in informal jobs with little security, which limits growth and increases poverty.\n\n**What's next step** – To fully benefit from its youth, Africa needs to improve education systems to match job market needs, create more formal jobs, and provide health and social protections. Governments should include young people in decision-making and invest in sectors like technology and renewable energy. Expanding support for girls and young women is also key.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Africa’s large young population can become a powerful force for development if given education, jobs, and support tailored to their needs.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’Afrique possède la population la plus jeune au monde, avec beaucoup d’enfants et d’adolescents. Cela contraste avec des pays comme le Japon, où la majorité est âgée. Bien que les jeunes africains aient un grand potentiel, beaucoup rencontrent des difficultés comme l’accès limité à l’éducation et à l’emploi.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Plusieurs pays africains ont lancé des programmes pour aider les jeunes à réussir. Par exemple, les hubs technologiques au Kenya soutiennent les jeunes innovateurs, la Tunisie intègre les startups dans les politiques d’emploi, et le Rwanda a réduit le chômage des jeunes grâce aux compétences numériques. Au Ghana, l’éducation secondaire gratuite a augmenté le nombre d’élèves. En Somalie, la fondation IFTIN forme des jeunes et offre un soutien psychologique.\n\n**Impact** – Ces initiatives montrent que lorsque les jeunes ont accès à l’éducation, aux compétences et au soutien, ils peuvent stimuler la croissance économique et le progrès social. Les jeunes filles, souvent plus défavorisées, deviennent des leaders grâce à des programmes de formation numérique. Sans ces efforts, beaucoup de jeunes travaillent dans l’informel, ce qui limite le développement et accroît la pauvreté.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Pour tirer pleinement parti de sa jeunesse, l’Afrique doit améliorer ses systèmes éducatifs pour répondre aux besoins du marché du travail, créer plus d’emplois formels et offrir des protections sociales et sanitaires. Les gouvernements doivent inclure les jeunes dans la prise de décisions et investir dans des secteurs comme la technologie et les énergies renouvelables. Soutenir davantage les filles et les jeunes femmes est aussi essentiel.\n\n**Phrase clé** – La grande population jeune d’Afrique peut devenir une force puissante de développement si elle reçoit une éducation, des emplois et un soutien adaptés à ses besoins.\n",

Esto contrasta con países como Japón, donde la mayoría son personas mayores. Aunque los jóvenes africanos tienen un gran potencial, enfrentan desafíos como el acceso limitado a la educación y al empleo.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Varios países africanos han iniciado programas para ayudar a los jóvenes a tener éxito. Por ejemplo, los centros tecnológicos en Kenia apoyan a jóvenes innovadores, Túnez integra startups en políticas de empleo y Ruanda ha reducido el desempleo juvenil con habilidades digitales. En Ghana, la educación secundaria gratuita aumentó la matrícula escolar. En Somalia, la fundación IFTIN capacita a jóvenes y ofrece apoyo mental.\n\n**Impacto** – Estos esfuerzos muestran que cuando los jóvenes reciben educación, habilidades y apoyo, pueden impulsar el crecimiento económico y el progreso social. Las jóvenes, que enfrentan más desafíos, se están convirtiendo en líderes gracias a programas de formación digital. Sin estos apoyos, muchos jóvenes trabajan en empleos informales, lo que limita el desarrollo y aumenta la pobreza.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Para aprovechar plenamente a su juventud, África debe mejorar los sistemas educativos para que coincidan con las necesidades laborales, crear más empleos formales y proporcionar protección social y de salud. Los gobiernos deben incluir a los jóvenes en la toma de decisiones e invertir en sectores como tecnología y energías renovables. También es clave ampliar el apoyo a niñas y jóvenes mujeres.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – La gran población joven de África puede ser una fuerza poderosa para el desarrollo si recibe educación, empleo y apoyo adaptados a sus necesidades.\n",

      "summary": "Access to high quality data to train generative AI in the EU should go hand in hand with fair remuneration for the creative sector.Committee on Legal Affairs Source : © European Union, 2026 - EP",
      "content": "On Wednesday, Legal Affairs Committee MEPs adopted a series of proposals to ensure full transparency and fair remuneration of rightsholders for the use of copyrighted work by generative artificial intelligence (genAI), by 17 votes in favour, 3 against, and with 2 abstentions.\n\nRemuneration for use of protected work\n\nMEPs want EU copyright law to apply to all generative AI systems available on the EU market, regardless where the training takes place. Since genAI relies on and reproduces protected content, MEPs want full transparency about its use, including a list of each copyrighted work used and detailed records of crawling activities by AI providers and deployers. Failure to comply with transparency requirements could be tantamount to infringement of copyright, for which AI providers could bear legal consequences.\n\nMEPs also demand fair remuneration for the use of copyrighted content by AI to ensure that the EU’s creative and cultural sector can thrive in the AI age. They call on the Commission to examine whether such remuneration could also apply to past use, while rejecting the idea of a global licence allowing providers to train their genAI systems in exchange for a flat-rate payment.\n\nProtecting the news media sector and individual rights\n\nIn the report, MEPs call on the Commission and member states to protect media pluralism, which is threatened by AI systems aggregating the news in a selective manner, diverting their traffic and revenues. They believe that the news media sector must have full control over the use of its content for training AI systems, including the possibility to refuse such use. MEPs also urge the Commission to ensure adequate remuneration for this use.\n\nMEPs believe that content fully generated by AI should not be protected by copyright. They call for measures to protect individuals against the dissemination of manipulated and AI-generated content and for an obligation on digital service providers to act against such illegal use.\n\nPossibility for rightsholders to prevent their work from being used by AI\n\nMEPs call for new rules to address the licensing of copyrighted material for use by genAI and call on the Commission to facilitate the establishment of voluntary collective licensing agreements per sector accessible to all, including individual creators and small and medium-sized enterprises. They also ask the Commission to explore tools allowing rightsholders to prevent their work from being used by general-purpose AI systems.\n\nQuote\n\nFollowing the vote, rapporteur Axel Voss (EPP, DE) said: “Generative AI must not operate outside the rule of law. If copyrighted works are used to train AI systems, creators are entitled to transparency, legal certainty, and fair compensation. Innovation cannot come at the expense of copyright, both can and must coexist. Clear and enforceable rules are key to ensuring Europe’s technological sovereignty. Our aim is to foster innovation while safeguarding the core principles of intellectual property.”\n\nNext steps\n\nThis own initiative report will be put to a Parliament vote in plenary in March.\n\nBackground\n\nThe report seeks to answer key legal questions about the interplay between genAI and copyright, including how to ensure transparency, consent and fair remuneration of creators and rightsholders when their protected works are used in the generation, dissemination and distribution of AI outputs.",

A total of 71 percent of ethnic Macedonians support the country’s candidacy for EU membership, which represents an increase of 15 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nAmong ethnic Albanians, strong support for the country’s aspirations for EU membership continues to be expressed. This support is maintained in 2025, with 76 percent of respondents from this group declaring themselves positively. However, this percentage is 8 percent lower compared to the previous year.\n\nAccording to the research, 40 percent of the population believe that the country is ready to become a member state, and slightly more than 60 percent of the population believe that progress has been made in the accession process over the past year. The research shows that 46 percent of the population believe that obstructions from neighboring countries are the biggest obstacle to North Macedonia’s progress towards EU membership.\n\nThe number of respondents who believe that the country will become an EU member in the next 3–5 years has increased and in 2025 stands at 30 percent, while a relatively high share of the population (19 percent) remains pessimistic about North Macedonia’s prospects for EU membership.\n\nAnamarija Velinovska, researcher at the Center for European Integrations at IDSCS, emphasized that the first part of the research shows how citizens view the process from within and what the necessary steps are.\n\n– What we have been following for three years now is that support for the constitutional amendments remains at 24 percent and here there is an obvious gap between ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. In fact, it shows that 57 percent of ethnic Albanians are in favor of constitutional amendments, while only 11 percent of Macedonian respondents are in favor of constitutional amendments – said Velinovska.\n\nMarko Troshanovski, president of ICDS, emphasized that for the first time this year, after several years of decline, support for the EU has recorded a significant increase and exceeds 70 percent.\n\n– What is also interesting is that the number of those citizens who think that Macedonia should sit on the sidelines and do nothing regarding the enlargement process has decreased. From 2023, when that percentage was 29 percent, it is now 21, that is, eight percentage points fewer citizens think that Macedonia should do nothing and not be active in this challenge, but that our country, state and Government should be much more active in the area of European integration – says Troshanovski.\n\nAccording to him, what is an interesting piece of data is that the EU continues to be considered the most important and most influential ally of the country and, in the context of current geopolitical upheavals, it is obvious that citizens are leaning towards the alternative or option in which they see the greatest security, safety and perspective.

El estudio también encontró que menos personas están indecisas o indiferentes.\n\n**Impacto** – Este aumento en el apoyo es importante porque muestra que más personas creen que unirse a la UE traerá seguridad, protección y mejores perspectivas para el futuro. También significa que menos personas quieren que el país se quede inactivo respecto a la adhesión. La UE sigue siendo vista como el aliado más importante, especialmente en tiempos de incertidumbre política en la región. Sin embargo, hay desafíos, como desacuerdos con países vecinos que retrasan el progreso.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El gobierno y los ciudadanos probablemente seguirán trabajando para unirse a la UE, intentando superar obstáculos y aumentar la preparación. Con más apoyo, puede haber una presión mayor sobre los líderes para avanzar, incluyendo cambios constitucionales que algunos grupos étnicos apoyan más que otros.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Más del 70 % de los macedonios del norte apoyan unirse a la UE, mostrando un aumento claro en la esperanza y compromiso hacia la integración europea pese a los desafíos actuales.",

      "content": "Skopje – The door of the European Union is wide open. There is full support for North Macedonia to join the EU and I believe that at this moment it is necessary for the country to unite – the Government, the opposition, the Parliament, civil society, businesses and young people to be pragmatic in accelerating the reforms, said today the EU ambassador in the country, Mihail Rokas.\n\nAt the promotion of the two research papers, “Analysis of Public Opinion on the Accession of North Macedonia to the European Union (2014 – 2025)” and “New Global Uncertainties, Old European Obligations: Public Opinion on EU Accession in 2025” in the Parliament, he expressed his conviction that although the survey showed that citizens believe that the external factor is an obstacle to joining the Union, if internal unification happens, the other obstacles will be overcome.\n\n– I guarantee you that if this happens, regardless of what citizens think about there being problems, the obstacles to accession will be overcome. Not only must action be taken immediately and it is not just an opportunity that should be used, but the timing is right as well. We cannot compare this year and last year with the situations five or six or four years ago – said Rokas, emphasizing that now the question is how to build partnership, trust and whom to trust.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction that, according to the analysis, the EU is the partner with the greatest trust.\n\n– I hope that with the effort we will jointly invest this year we will have even better results next year, not only in the survey but also from a pragmatic aspect in terms of the country’s movement towards the EU – said Rokas.\n\nComparing the research with that of last year, he emphasized that the results provide a great incentive, that is, the percentage of the population that is “for” joining the Union has increased by 10 percent, from 61 to 71 percent.\n\n– Support from young people is greater. It is very important that young people also support it, that is, young people show that this is the future. It is a boost that the gap between different ethnicities or the participation of political parties is narrowing, there is a smaller divide. Everyone is “for” the EU. We note that citizens also reflect the priorities of the EU growth plan and the reform agenda, specifically the protection of the environment, but also judicial reforms and the fight against corruption – emphasized Rokas.\n\nAccording to him, a great incentive is that the European Union continues to be a trusted partner of the country, an economic partner and the main donor.\n\n– A very big incentive for us is the finding that citizens believe that the country will enter the EU has risen from only 17 to over 30 percent – added Rokas.
