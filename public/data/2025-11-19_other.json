      "content": "Ancient rock art was meant to be heard as well as seen and now acoustic archaeologists are bringing the sounds of prehistoric rituals to life\n\nArtists painted in places where echoes and resonance created otherworldly sonic effects Patrick Aventurier/Getty Images\n\nDeep underground, thousands of years of silence are abruptly broken by a researcher singing. His voice seems to awaken the walls of the cavern as the intimate space comes alive with the sound of our ancestors. Then he follows the cave’s resonant response, until the beam of his headlamp falls upon a panel of ancient paintings.\n\nThis crude experiment, performed decades ago, led to a remarkable discovery: that prehistoric rock art, created from 40,000 to 3,000 years ago, was meant to be heard as well as seen. “The oldest painted sites have this low, strange resonance, where if you sing, suddenly the cave sings back to you,” says Rupert Till at the University of Huddersfield, UK.\n\nGetting solid scientific evidence to support this idea hasn’t been easy. Now, however, a seven-year study into the acoustic properties of rock art sites around the globe has provided it. The Artsoundscapes project leaves little doubt that prehistoric artists deliberately painted in places where echoes, resonance and sound transmission created otherworldly sonic effects. “I was completely amazed,” says archaeologist and project leader Margarita Díaz-Andreu at the University of Barcelona, Spain, recalling her experiments at Valltorta gorge in eastern Spain. “Before the paintings, there was barely any reverberation, but as soon as we reached the paintings, the sound changed immediately.”\n\nAnd that’s just the start. By studying the peculiar soundscapes in which ancient artworks are embedded, Díaz-Andreu, Till and other archaeoacoustic researchers are beginning to reconstruct the ways in which these ancient, multisensory illustrations amplified the potency of prehistoric rituals, storytelling and shamanic musical performance – and, perhaps, even altered listeners’ states of consciousness.\n\nListening for echoes\n\nThat first researcher who used song to bring a new dimension to our understanding of Stone Age people was a French musicologist called Iégor Reznikoff, now a professor emeritus at Paris Nanterre University. He spent years vocalising inside palaeolithic caves in use from 18,000 to 11,000 years ago in his homeland before documenting his findings in the late 1980s. Counting the seconds between echoes, he noted a relationship between the placement of rock art and acoustic phenomena. “Iégor can go into a cave and make noises and guide you to rock art by listening for echoes,” says Till. “I’ve been into these caves with him.”\n\nReznikoff’s methods of talking to the walls lacked rigour, and his conclusions were largely ignored by archaeologists. But his ideas reverberated around the fringes of academia, where the emerging field of archaeoacoustics was struggling for recognition. Among the first to expand upon his findings was Steve Waller at the American Rock Art Research Association, who recorded echoes of up to 31 decibels at some decorated spots in deep caves in France, while unpainted walls in the same caverns were acoustically dead.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Weekly The best of New Scientist, including long-reads, culture, podcasts and news, each week. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“ In deep caves, the echoes blur together like thunder, and it gives you this vision of a stampede of hoofed animals “\n\n“In deep caves, the echoes blur together like thunder, and it gives you this vision of a stampede of hoofed animals,” says Waller. Writing in Nature in 1993, he pointed out that more than 90 per cent of European rock art depicts hoofed mammals like horses and bison, and suggested that echoing caves might have been interpreted as the homes of the thunder gods, who were embodied by these stampeding beasts.\n\nTwo decades later, with archaeoacoustics still largely overlooked as a legitimate field, Till launched the Songs of the Caves project to study the acoustics of painted caverns in northern Spain. Rather than just timing the delay between echoes, he and his colleagues took a measurement called the impulse response, which entails quantifying the movement of sound waves through a space when a short, sharp sound is played to give a so-called sonic fingerprint. “We did 250-odd acoustic samples in the caves, both next to rock art and where there was no rock art,” says Till. “And we showed that there was a statistical relationship between the likelihood of there being a piece of rock art and an ‘unusual’ acoustic phenomenon that was associated with it.”\n\nAround the same time, Díaz-Andreu began investigating the soundscapes at Stone Age sites across Europe, providing more nuanced insights into these acoustic relationships. In Spain’s Sierra de San Serván, for instance, she noted that art was predominantly found in rock shelters with “augmented audibility”. “This means that the places that had been chosen to be painted were those from which you could acoustically control the landscape,” she says. To give a sense of what this might mean, she recounts being able to hear a distant dog-walker’s phone conversation with astonishing clarity while standing at one of the decorated spots.\n\nAlthough these findings helped to advance the field of archaeoacoustics, many scholars continued to regard it as a fringe discipline. So, in 2018, Díaz-Andreu initiated Artsoundscapes, which introduced cutting-edge methods to systematically measure sonic phenomena at painted sites across the world. Among the techniques pioneered by her team was the use of a dodecahedron featuring 12 loudspeakers to create a dynamic, omnidirectional impulse response. The researchers also used computerised models like geographic information systems to map the connections between rock art and acoustic effects.\n\nEquipment used to measure acoustics in Cuevas de la Araña N. Santos da Rosa\n\nSince wrapping up the project earlier this year, the team has published a series of studies from sites across four continents. They reveal that prehistoric cultures around the world used sound in strikingly different ways. In Siberia’s Altai mountains, for example, amplification and unusually high clarity of sound were detected at potential gathering spots, where rituals and offerings involving music may once have taken place. In Mexico’s Santa Teresa canyon, there is rock art at sites where pre-Hispanic cultures are thought to have held ritual dances. And at Spain’s Cuevas de la Araña, the researchers report finding paintings primarily where the caves’ acoustics “could have intensified the sensory effect and emotional impact of ceremonies likely performed with musical accompaniment”.\n\nThe team also visited White River Narrows, a canyon in Nevada where Waller had previously noted an unusual sonic connection between painted rock faces. “Some of the rock art sites can actually communicate with each other, so if you’re at one, you can hear the echoing coming to you from another,” he says. Building on this, the Artsoundscapes researchers discovered that certain painted spaces outside the canyon lack reverberation but possess exceptional sound transmission, reproducing sounds with great clarity and amplification. Therefore, they concluded, these sites would have been more suitable for storytelling than shamanic rituals.\n\nOnly in South Africa’s Maloti-Drakensberg mountains – which are famous for their San rock art – did the team fail to find a connection between paintings and sound. “We were expecting fantastic results – something new and exciting,” says Díaz-Andreu. “We didn’t find them.”\n\nPerceiving a “presence”\n\nAlthough there is no universal pattern, there is a growing consensus that painted sites worldwide were often chosen for their extraordinary acoustic properties and the impact these would have had on people’s consciousness. In Finland’s lake district, for example, prehistoric hunter-gatherers were inspired to leave their mark on cliffs that produced a disorienting sonic reflection. “The [wall] repeats, or doubles, every sound that you make in front of it, so that you experience a kind of doubled reality that is not normal,” says Riitta Rainio at the University of Helsinki in Finland. “It’s not a long echo like in caves, but a single reflection that’s very short, sharp and strong.”\n\nRainio and her colleagues have conducted psychoacoustic experiments to measure the subjective response of modern listeners to this auditory illusion. They found that people tend to perceive a “presence” at these painted sites. In one recent paper, they wrote that the sounds seem to “emanate from invisible sources behind the paintings” and that “a prehistoric visitor, who marvelled at the voices, music, and noises emanating from the rock, would have recognised them as coming from a human-like source, perhaps some kind of apparition or living person inside the rock”.\n\nSpeaking of her own experiences at the lakeside rock faces, Rainio says: “I was often quite scared, because I really thought that there was someone else there. There’s this phenomenon where it seems like someone is approaching you as you approach the cliff.”\n\n“ There’s this phenomenon where it seems like someone is approaching you as you approach the cliff “\n\nSimilarly, the Artsoundscapes team has investigated the psychoacoustic impact of rock art sites in both Siberia and the Mediterranean. Using the impulse response data from decorated caves in the Altai mountains, the team created “auralizations” of natural sounds – including animal calls, weather phenomena and the crackling of a bonfire – as if heard from within these spaces. In laboratory tests, participants reported that these digitised soundscapes evoked feelings of “presence”, “closeness” and “tension”.\n\nTeaming up with neuroscientists at the University of Barcelona’s Brainlab, Díaz-Andreu’s group also used electroencephalography (EEG) to study the ways in which certain sounds influence human brain activity. Their findings suggest that our brainwaves tend to synchronise with music that has a tempo of 99 beats per minute, potentially triggering altered states of consciousness. How this discovery relates to ancient shamanic rituals at rock art sites is a matter of conjecture, however. “We don’t know for sure what the meaning of those sites was, but they are generally regarded as sacred, religious or ritual places,” says Rainio. “And ritual usually means some kind of sound-making, which is often music.” Tellingly, some of the paintings in Finland depict people playing drums.\n\nPrehistoric sounds\n\nAnother clue about the sorts of sounds prehistoric people made at these decorated rock faces comes from the painted Isturitz cave in France, where 35,000-year-old flutes made from vulture bones have been found. By playing replicas of these prehistoric instruments inside the caverns where they were discovered, Till became the first person since the Stone Age to experience their ritual potential. “Previously, I’d only ever heard these bone flutes in classrooms or in concert halls, where they have quite a polite sound, a small sound,” he says. “But then you take them into the cave and they produce this enormous, soaring sound, which transforms the cave into a space that sings.”\n\nListen: Vulture bone replica of the Hohle Fels flute being played by Anna Friedericke Potengowski in the Hohle Fels cave\n\nhttps://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/05124145/2.-anna-fp-hohle-fels-flute-in-hf-cave-seeberger-piece.mp3\n\nSimilar experiments have been conducted by archaeologist Fernando Coimbra at the Portuguese Centre for Geohistory and Prehistory, who played replicas of ancient bone flutes at a palaeolithic rock art site called Escoural cave. “When I played songs outside the cave, the sound vanished, but inside, the cave acts as an amplifier,” he says.\n\nIn addition, archaeoacoustics researchers are moving beyond the sphere of rock art to reveal the many ways in which music may have shaped ancient ritual experiences. At the 5000-year-old Neolithic tomb of Ħal Saflieni in Malta, for instance, experiments by both Till and Coimbra have identified unusual resonant frequencies within a chamber called the oracle room. “If you play a large drum in there, the bass frequencies sustain for about 35 seconds, which is just remarkable”, says Till. “So, you have to think of Ħal Saflieni not as a place where music was played, but as a musical instrument in itself, because the resonances are so strong that if you play anything in there, the building rings.”\n\nListen: Iégor Reznikoff singing in the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni\n\nhttps://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/05122555/1.-iegor-reznikoff-in-the-hypogeum-of-hal-saflieni.mp3\n\nInspired by similar, earlier findings, neuroscientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, used EEG to measure how these acoustic resonances affect human brain activity. Intriguingly, they discovered that frequencies close to 110 hertz – characteristic of a low baritone voice – tend to deactivate the brain’s language centres and may boost emotional processing within the prefrontal cortex. This supports the idea that ritual chanting at places like Ħal Saflieni may have altered the consciousness of people within the space.\n\nNevertheless, not everyone is convinced that these sites were deliberately engineered to produce such acoustic effects. A 3000-year-old temple in Peru, for instance, creates acoustic resonances at the same frequency as those produced by conch shell horns – or pututus – excavated at the site. “I don’t believe, personally, that the Chavín architecture was built simply to work with these conch shells,” says archaeoacoustic researcher Miriam Kolar at Stanford University in California. “But I’m convinced by the evidence that the relationship did not go unnoticed. It’s impossible to perform a pututu blast in any of the spaces of Chavín without getting some sort of strong sensory effect.”\n\nWe don’t know exactly what went on at the site, but Kolar says the “whole body response” triggered by these extraordinary acoustics may have provided a basis for ritual activities by creating a powerful shared experience. Likewise, Till’s archaeoacoustic research at Stonehenge in the UK suggests that the rhythmic sound of percussion would have “made the whole space resonate like a wine glass”, potentially synchronising the emotional experiences of thousands of participants during solstice rituals some 5000 years ago.\n\nA temple in Peru produces acoustic resonances that match the frequency of conch shells found at the site David Ryan/Alamy\n\nBringing the story full circle, Till thinks that these Neolithic monuments may have served to perpetuate the ritual function of Palaeolithic rock art sites. “We used to have caves where the spirits lived, and we knew the spirits lived there because we could hear their reverberation,” he says. “But when we left the caves to occupy the open spaces and the plains, we needed a place where the ancestors could be.” Stonehenge, Ħal Saflieni and other similar monuments may therefore have been built as new homes for the dead, where the voices of the spirits could once again be heard and consulted through sonic rituals.\n\nThis body of work is finally bringing archaeoacoustics into the fold of mainstream academia. More broadly, these findings underscore the importance of incorporating sound into archaeology, both in terms of enhancing our understanding of ancient ritual experiences and the conservation of prehistoric material culture. Waller points out that at famous rock art sites around the world, visitors are encouraged to exercise decorum and hush, yet until we reintroduce sound to these spaces, we won’t know what it is we are trying to protect.\n\n“I’m advocating for the preservation of the sound, because there are examples where they’ve built a visitor centre right in the middle of the canyon or they’ve put the restroom right in front of the rock art panel, and they’re unintentionally ruining the acoustics,” he says.\n\n“I’m trying to spread the word, to preserve the soundscapes.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nFor many years, scientists have studied ancient rock paintings to understand prehistoric life. These paintings, found in caves and rock shelters, date back tens of thousands of years. Until recently, researchers mostly focused on what these images showed, not the sounds that might have been part of these places.\n\n**What happened**\nA new scientific project called Artsoundscapes studied the sounds inside caves and rock shelters with ancient paintings. Researchers measured echoes, resonance, and sound clarity at sites around the world. They discovered that prehistoric people chose places for their art because these spots had special acoustic effects. For example, singing or playing instruments in these caves would cause the walls to echo or amplify sounds. Some sites even allowed sounds to travel clearly between distant painted areas.\n\n**Impact**\nThis discovery shows that ancient people used sound as part of their rituals and storytelling, making these places more than just visual art galleries. The special sounds could have made ceremonies more powerful or even changed how people felt and thought during rituals. For example, playing bone flutes inside caves created loud, soaring sounds that transformed the space. The findings also suggest that ancient monuments like Stonehenge might have been designed to produce musical resonance, helping large groups share emotional experiences.\n\n**What's next step**\nScientists want to protect these sound environments as part of our cultural heritage. Some places have already been damaged by visitor centers or restrooms that spoil the natural acoustics. Researchers also hope to use sound studies to learn more about ancient rituals and how prehistoric people connected with their surroundings. New technology will help explore more sites and deepen our understanding of the role of sound in human history.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nAncient rock art sites were chosen for their unique sound effects, showing that prehistoric people combined music and art to enrich their rituals and stories.\n",

      "content": "Participating in the General Assembly of the Union of Regions of Greece via direct connection from Brussels was Apostolos Tzitzikostas. The European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, after greeting […]\n\nParticipating in the General Assembly of the Union of Regions of Greece via direct connection from Brussels was Apostolos Tzitzikostas. The European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, after greeting the Assembly, had good news to convey to Athens. As he said, specific changes were passed yesterday in the EU that strengthen the role of the Regions and announced the vertical road and rail axis that will connect Thessaloniki with Bucharest, the exact plan of which will be signed on December 4.\n\nMr. Tzitzikostas began by saying: “It is a special honor for me to participate today, even from here, from Brussels, in the General Assembly of ENPE. And it is a special moment, not only because I have served this space for more than ten years, with a lot of work, responsibility, and faith, but also because ENPE has been, is, and will remain a large family of Greek regional self-government, a space for cooperation and connection of forces.”\n\nHe then emphasized: “For the first time, I am not at the General Assembly, but I am not here for a good reason. And that is because at yesterday’s meeting of the College of Commissioners, we made the decision, after months of negotiations, after a lot of pressure from my side, but also from the responsible Commissioner Raffaele Fitto, we managed to pass very specific changes for the new programming period, changes that strengthen the role of the Regions.\n\nAnd so, since I heard some of today’s presentations, I will tell you that Europe understands, realizes the need to further strengthen the Regions in the new budget, and thus, it is back on the table, after yesterday’s decision we made, that the Regions must participate and not just watch as spectators, in a model that will be centralized, which was the concern of all of you during the previous period.\n\nI think these are very pleasant news, as the 13 Regions of the country have proven through successive crises over the years, economic, health, energy, natural crises, price and inflation crises, that not only can they stand tall, but also keep society united. And this is the most solid foundation on which we can today build the new era of the Regions.”\n\nImmediately after, Mr. Tzitzikostas pointed out: “When we started the great effort to strengthen the institution ten years ago, few believed that the Regions could manage European resources and complex European programs adequately and effectively. However, together we proved in practice that not only can we succeed, boosting the absorption rates of resources and project implementation, but also that the Regions are the most essential, reliable, and close governance institution to local communities. That is why today the demand for strong regional governance is not just an institutional request, as it may have been in previous years, but a historical necessity for Greece to become even stronger, for the country to operate even more effectively, to reduce distances and delays for politics to reach society. The reform coming in Local Government, the new Charter, the transition we hope for in regional governance, is a huge opportunity for the place, for our citizens, for development, for competitiveness.”\n\nReferring to the EU, Mr. Tzitzikostas said: “Throughout the European Union, regional governance is a key pillar of Democracy. It is precisely there where Europe can reach where the European plan becomes a reality. And as a Commissioner through the sectors I am responsible for, I see every day the importance of the active participation of the Regions. And we will strengthen this even more in the coming years. Because Europe needs its Regions, and that is why we made the decision yesterday. Because it also needs the Greek Regions, which prove in practice that they can play a leading role in infrastructure projects, in investments, in tourism, in extroversion, in innovation, in solidarity, but also in social cohesion.”\n\nAt this point, the European Commissioner spoke about the railway connection between Thessaloniki and Bucharest:\n\n“Transport and tourism are two major levers of development, from the large urban centers to the most remote islands and mountain villages, because when we invest in modern networks, in smart mobility, in sustainable transport, in modern tourist centers, we are not just building infrastructure, we are building strong local economies, creating opportunities. Thus, from the very first moment I took office as Commissioner, I set a specific project as a top priority on the European agenda. And that is nothing other than the vertical road and rail axis that will connect Thessaloniki with Bucharest. And after meetings with the responsible ministers, I am pleased to announce that on December 4, here in Brussels, we will sign together with the three ministers a precise plan with tight timelines, an action plan that will allow the projects to start immediately, so that Greece can finally connect with Romania by rail and road, with a modern highway.\n\nYou understand the advantages of this project. Strategically, Greece is entering a different track. And of course, the security of Europe is enhanced, because not only Greece is connected with Romania, but at the same time the Aegean is connected with the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. You understand what this means for our security, for transport, for trade, for extroversion, for tourism. Because essentially, Greece is now connected to Central Europe. And so, in the coming period, we will have very important initiatives to announce.”\n\nMr. Tzitzikostas added that the title “Restart” chosen for the General Assembly is of great significance in a time of great challenges that requires bold decisions. He thanked the Minister of Interior Theodoros Livanios for the work he has done, saying that “I consider him one of the best Interior Ministers Greece has ever known” and concluded:\n\n“The Regions will therefore gain a more substantial role, greater responsibility, and trust. A strong Europe is built with strong Regions, it is built with a strong Greece that moves forward, a Greece with strong local communities.” (13/11/25)",

      "summary": "European Commissioner for Trade Maroš Šefčovič thanked the EU member states for approving the proposal for protective measures in the area of ferroalloys.",
      "content": "Brussels – The European Commission’s (EC) decision on Tuesday to protect the ferroalloy sector in the EU by imposing final protective measures on the import of certain ferroalloys will support the resilience of the European industry and help protect the interests of the Slovak steel industry as well. This was stated to TASR by the European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maroš Šefčovič.\n\nThe European Commissioner appreciated that the member states approved the EC’s proposal to introduce protective measures for the ferroalloy sector, which is a material without which strong, reinforced steel cannot be produced, which is important because the EU cannot afford for its strategic industry to collapse under the weight of increasing import pressures. “We know that the steel industry is the backbone of the entire engineering sector and essentially of the industry in Slovakia. So I am very pleased that we managed to approve this,” said Maroš Šefčovič, who thanked the member states, including Slovakia, for endorsing this proposal from the European Commission.\n\nHe reminded that this fits into a broader series of measures that the European Commission has approved, whether they are protective measures to support the steel industry or decisions regarding ferroalloys, which will be important for the steel plant in Košice and for production in Orava, where the Orava ferroalloy plants have a long tradition of production.\n\nThe Commission will also focus on the export of aluminum scrap\n\n“We have also started preparing further measures, this time to protect against the export of aluminum scrap. It is indeed a rare raw material,\n\nwhich is very important for the competitiveness of European steel and engineering,” added the Slovak European Commissioner.\n\nHe explained that when it comes to processing aluminum scrap, the problem for the EU so far has been that aluminum has often been exported abroad, and the raw material from which it is much cheaper to produce new aluminum products has been disappearing in third countries, leaving European aluminum producers without this material, forcing them to produce it at much higher energy and financial costs.\n\n“This is being done in order to strengthen this sector, both in Europe and in Slovakia,” he described the situation. He confirmed that this also fits into the EU’s concept of a circular economy. “But mainly it protects the European market from overproduction capacities that flood Europe, whether from Asia or in this case from some Nordic countries. Simply put, this measure was adopted to maintain our economic security, protect important sectors of the industry, and reduce dependencies on imports from abroad. Without these measures, we would not have been able to protect the ferroalloy industry in Europe,” he stated.\n\nNegotiations in Australia with partners from the Indo-Pacific region\n\nŠefčovič also told TASR that he is traveling on a business trip to Australia, where he is expected to sign a new form of partnership with the countries of the Indo-Pacific region on behalf of the EU this week, representing 30% of the world’s GDP.
