      "title": "NASA scientists say meteorites can’t explain mysterious organic compounds on Mars",
      "summary": "Scientists studying a rock sample collected by NASA’s Curiosity rover have uncovered something tantalizing: the largest organic molecules ever detected on Mars. The compounds — decane, undecane, and dodecane — may be fragments of fatty acids, which on Earth are most often linked to life. While non-living processes like meteorite impacts can also create such molecules, researchers found those sources couldn’t fully explain the amounts detected.",
      "content": "A new scientific analysis suggests that known non biological processes cannot fully explain the amount of organic material discovered in a rock collected on Mars by NASA's Curiosity rover. Organic compounds are carbon containing molecules that form the chemical building blocks of life as we know it. They can be created by living organisms, but some can also form through natural chemical reactions that do not involve life.\n\nCuriosity, which has been exploring Gale Crater since 2012, carries a miniature chemistry lab designed to heat rock samples and analyze the gases they release. Using this onboard laboratory, scientists detected several intriguing compounds in a drilled rock sample.\n\nLargest Organic Molecules Yet Found on Mars\n\nIn March 2025, researchers announced they had identified trace amounts of decane, undecane, and dodecane. These are hydrocarbons, meaning they are made only of carbon and hydrogen atoms. They belong to a group of molecules that can be related to fatty acids. Fatty acids are important components of cell membranes in living organisms on Earth, although similar molecules can also form through purely geological reactions under certain conditions.\n\nThe rock that contained these compounds is an ancient mudstone located in Gale Crater. Mudstone forms from fine grained sediment that once settled in water, suggesting the area may have hosted lakes billions of years ago. Scientists proposed that the molecules detected by Curiosity could be fragments of fatty acids that were preserved in the rock over vast stretches of time.\n\nCould Meteorites Explain the Mars Organics\n\nCuriosity's instruments can identify molecules, but they cannot directly determine how those molecules formed. Because of this limitation, researchers could not tell whether the compounds were produced by biological activity or by non living chemical processes.\n\nTo explore that question, scientists conducted a follow up investigation focused on known non biological sources. One possibility is that meteorites striking Mars delivered organic material to the surface. Meteorites are known to contain carbon based molecules, and impacts have been common throughout Martian history. The team evaluated whether this type of external delivery, along with other abiotic chemical reactions, could account for the levels of organic compounds measured in the sample.\n\nWriting on Feb. 4 in the journal Astrobiology, the researchers reported that the non biological mechanisms they examined could not fully account for the abundance of organic compounds detected by Curiosity. Based on their analysis, they concluded that it is reasonable to consider the possibility that living organisms could have contributed to the formation of these molecules.\n\nThis does not mean life has been confirmed on Mars. Instead, it suggests that non living explanations alone may not be sufficient to explain the data.\n\nReconstructing 80 Million Years of Radiation Exposure\n\nTo better understand how much organic material may have originally been present, the scientists combined laboratory radiation experiments, computer simulations, and Curiosity's measurements. Mars lacks a thick atmosphere and a global magnetic field like Earth's, which means its surface is constantly exposed to cosmic radiation. Over time, this radiation can break apart complex molecules.\n\nThe team attempted to \"rewind the clock\" by about 80 million years, which is how long the rock is estimated to have been exposed at the Martian surface. By modeling how radiation gradually destroys organic molecules, they calculated how much material would have existed before being degraded. Their results indicate that the original quantity of organic compounds was likely far greater than what typical non biological processes are known to produce.\n\nMore Research Needed on Organic Molecules on Mars\n\nThe researchers emphasize that further experiments are necessary to understand how quickly organic molecules break down in Mars like rocks under Mars like environmental conditions. Laboratory studies that better replicate Martian temperatures, radiation levels, and chemistry will help refine these estimates.\n\nUntil more data are available, scientists cannot draw firm conclusions about whether these compounds point to past life or can ultimately be explained through chemistry alone. What the findings do show is that the chemical story preserved in Martian rocks may be more complex and more intriguing than previously thought.",

      "title": "Asteroid Bennu reveals a new pathway to life’s chemistry",
      "summary": "Dust from asteroid Bennu is revealing a surprising origin story for life’s building blocks. New research suggests some amino acids formed in frozen ice exposed to radiation, not warm liquid water as scientists long believed. Isotopic clues show Bennu’s chemistry differs sharply from well-studied meteorites, pointing to multiple pathways for creating life’s ingredients.",
      "content": "When NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission returned material from asteroid Bennu in 2023, scientists confirmed that the 4.6 billion year old rocks contained amino acids, the essential molecules that make life possible. Amino acids are responsible for building proteins and peptides in DNA, and they are central to nearly every biological process. What remained unclear was how these molecules formed in space in the first place.\n\nNew research led by scientists at Penn State suggests that at least some of Bennu's amino acids may have originated in extremely cold, radioactive conditions during the earliest stages of the solar system. The findings were published on Feb. 9 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nAccording to the team, the chemical signatures in Bennu's samples indicate that these amino acids likely formed through processes different from those scientists traditionally assumed, and under much harsher conditions than expected.\n\n\"Our results flip the script on how we have typically thought amino acids formed in asteroids,\" said Allison Baczynski, assistant research professor of geosciences at Penn State and co-lead author on the paper. \"It now looks like there are many conditions where these building blocks of life can form, not just when there's warm liquid water. Our analysis showed that there's much more diversity in the pathways and conditions in which these amino acids can be formed.\"\n\nIsotope Analysis Reveals Glycine's Origins\n\nThe researchers worked with a small amount of Bennu material, about the size of a teaspoon. Using specially adapted instruments, they measured isotopes, which are slight differences in the mass of atoms. These subtle variations can reveal how and where molecules were formed.\n\nThe team concentrated on glycine, the simplest amino acid. Glycine is a small two carbon molecule that plays a foundational role in biology. Amino acids connect in chains to form proteins, which perform nearly all essential functions in living organisms, from constructing cells to driving chemical reactions.\n\nBecause glycine can form under a variety of chemical conditions, scientists often use it as a marker for early prebiotic chemistry. Its presence in asteroids and comets supports the idea that some of the raw materials for life were created in space and later delivered to Earth.\n\nChallenging the Warm Water Theory\n\nFor many years, the leading explanation for how glycine formed was a process known as Strecker synthesis. In this reaction, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and aldehydes or ketones combine in liquid water. That model suggested amino acids formed in relatively mild, water rich environments.\n\nHowever, the isotopic evidence from Bennu points in a different direction. The data indicate that its glycine may have formed not in warm liquid water, but in frozen ice exposed to radiation in the outer regions of the young solar system.\n\n\"Here at Penn State, we have modified instrumentation that allows us to make isotopic measurements on really low abundances of organic compounds like glycine,\" Baczynski said. \"Without advances in technology and investment in specialized instrumentation, we would have never made this discovery.\"\n\nComparing Bennu to the Murchison Meteorite\n\nScientists have long studied amino acids in carbon rich meteorites, including the well known Murchison meteorite that fell in Australia in 1969. To better understand Bennu's chemistry, the Penn State team compared its amino acids with those found in Murchison.\n\nThe comparison revealed important differences. The amino acids in Murchison appear to have formed in environments that included liquid water and moderate temperatures. Such conditions could have existed on the meteorite's parent body and were also present on early Earth.\n\n\"One of the reasons why amino acids are so important is because we think that they played a big role in how life started on Earth,\" said Ophélie McIntosh, postdoctoral researcher in Penn State's Department of Geosciences and co-lead author on the paper. \"What's a real surprise is that the amino acids in Bennu show a much different isotopic pattern than those in Murchison, and these results suggest that Bennu and Murchison's parent bodies likely originated in chemically distinct regions of the solar system.\"\n\nNew Questions About Mirror Image Molecules\n\nThe study also uncovered a puzzling result. Amino acids exist in two mirror image forms, similar to left and right hands. Scientists previously expected these paired forms to share the same isotopic signature.\n\nIn Bennu's samples, however, the two mirror image versions of glutamic acid contain dramatically different nitrogen values. Why chemically identical mirror forms would display such different nitrogen signatures is still unknown, and researchers plan to investigate further.\n\n\"We have more questions now than answers,\" Baczynski said. \"We hope that we can continue to analyze a range of different meteorites to look at their amino acids. We want to know if they continue to look like Murchison and Bennu, or maybe there is even more diversity in the conditions and pathways that can create the building blocks of life.\"\n\nOther Penn State co-authors are Mila Matney, doctoral candidate in geosciences; Christopher House, professor of geosciences; and Katherine Freeman, Evan Pugh University Professor of Geosciences at Penn State.\n\nOther authors on the paper are Danielle Simkus and Hannah McLain of the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science and Technology (CRESST) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; Jason P.

By reexamining radar data from NASA’s Magellan spacecraft, researchers identified what appears to be a huge empty conduit near the volcanic region Nyx Mons. The structure could be nearly a kilometer wide and extend for dozens of kilometers below the surface.",
      "content": "Volcanoes are not just an Earthly phenomenon. Scientists have already identified volcanic features, including lava tubes, on both Mars and the Moon. Now researchers from the University of Trento report strong evidence that Venus also contains an empty lava tube beneath its surface. The finding adds to growing evidence that volcanic forces have played a dominant role in shaping Venus's landscape and internal structure.\n\nThe underground cavity was detected through detailed radar data analysis as part of a project supported by the Italian Space Agency. The research was published in Nature Communications.\n\nA Rare Glimpse Beneath Venus's Surface\n\n\"Our knowledge of Venus is still limited, and until now we have never had the opportunity to directly observe processes occurring beneath the surface of Earth's twin planet. The identification of a volcanic cavity is therefore of particular importance, as it allows us to validate theories that for many years have only hypothesized their existence,\" explains Lorenzo Bruzzone, the coordinator of the research, full professor of Telecommunications and head of the Remote Sensing Laboratory at the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Trento.\n\n\"This discovery contributes to a deeper understanding of the processes that have shaped Venus's evolution and opens new perspectives for the study of the planet,\" he adds.\n\nWhy Lava Tubes Are Difficult to Detect\n\nLava tubes form below ground, which makes them hard to spot on any planet. Typically, they remain concealed unless part of the ceiling collapses. When that happens, a pit becomes visible at the surface. These openings can signal the presence of an underground passage and may even mark a potential entry point.\n\nVenus presents an added challenge. Thick clouds permanently cover the planet, blocking direct surface views from traditional cameras. To study its terrain, scientists must rely on radar imaging capable of penetrating the cloud layer.\n\nMagellan Radar Reveals a Subsurface Conduit\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992, NASA's Magellan spacecraft mapped Venus using a Synthetic Aperture Radar system. The team focused on radar images showing localized surface collapses and applied a specialized imaging technique they developed to detect and analyze underground conduits near skylights. Their investigation identified a large subsurface structure in the Nyx Mons region, named after the Greek goddess of the night.\n\n\"We analyzed Magellan's radar images where there are signs of localized surface collapses using an imaging technique that we have developed to detect and characterize underground conduits near skylights. Our analyses revealed the existence of a large subsurface conduit in the region of Nyx Mons, the area named after the Greek goddess of the night. We interpret the structure as a possible lava tube (pyroduct), with an estimated diameter of approximately one kilometer, a roof thickness of at least 150 meters and an empty void deep of no less than 375 meters,\" says Bruzzone.\n\nWhy Venus Could Produce Giant Lava Tubes\n\nVenus's environmental conditions may actually support the development of large lava tubes. The planet has lower gravity than Earth and a much denser atmosphere. These factors could help molten lava quickly form a thick insulating crust once it flows away from its source, preserving broad underground channels.\n\nThe newly identified structure appears larger than lava tubes observed on Earth or projected for Mars. Its dimensions place it at the upper limit of what scientists have proposed, and in one instance observed, on the Moon. This scale aligns with other volcanic features on Venus, where lava channels exceed the size and length of those found on other rocky worlds.\n\nImplications for Future Venus Missions\n\n\"The available data allow us to confirm and measure only the portion of the cavity close to the skylight. However, analysis of the morphology and elevation of the surrounding terrain, together with the presence of other pits similar with the one studied, supports the hypothesis that the subsurface conduits may extend for at least 45 kilometers. To test this hypothesis and identify additional lava tubes, new higher-resolution images and data acquired by radar systems capable of penetrating the surface will be required. The results of this study are therefore very important for future missions to Venus, such as the European Space Agency's Envision and NASA's Veritas. Both spacecraft will carry advanced radar systems capable of capturing higher-resolution images, allowing scientists to study small surface pits in greater detail. In addition, Envision will carry an orbital ground penetrating radar (Subsurface Radar Sounder) capable of probing Venus's subsurface to depths of several hundred meters and potentially detecting conduits even in the absence of surface openings. Our discovery therefore represents only the beginning of a long and fascinating research activity,\" he concludes.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Venus está cubierto por nubes densas que ocultan su superficie, dificultando que los científicos estudien lo que hay debajo. Usando datos de radar de la nave Magellan de la NASA en los años 1990, los investigadores han explorado las características volcánicas de Venus, pero hasta ahora no se habían encontrado tubos de lava subterráneos claros.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigadores de la Universidad de Trento examinaron imágenes antiguas de radar de la región volcánica Nyx Mons en Venus y encontraron evidencia de un enorme tubo de lava vacío bajo la superficie. Este tubo podría tener cerca de un kilómetro de ancho y extenderse por decenas de kilómetros bajo tierra. El descubrimiento se hizo al identificar un colapso en la superficie, o “tragaluz”, que mostró la cavidad subterránea.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta es la primera prueba fuerte de un gran tubo de lava subterráneo en Venus, mostrando que la actividad volcánica ha moldeado el planeta de manera similar a la Tierra, Marte y la Luna. El tamaño de este tubo es mucho mayor que los encontrados en la Tierra y Marte, lo que coincide con el ambiente único de Venus, con menor gravedad y atmósfera densa. Entender estos tubos ayuda a los científicos a aprender más sobre cómo se formó y cambió el paisaje de Venus.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Misiones futuras como Envision de la Agencia Espacial Europea y Veritas de la NASA usarán sistemas de radar más avanzados para obtener imágenes más claras y detalladas de Venus. Estas misiones buscan explorar la superficie y el subsuelo con más detalle, encontrar más tubos de lava y estudiar la geología y la historia volcánica del planeta.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Científicos han encontrado un enorme tubo de lava subterráneo en Venus, abriendo nuevas vías para estudiar su pasado volcánico y preparar futuras misiones espaciales.",

      "title": "Astronomers discover an Earth-like planet that may be colder than Mars",
      "summary": "A newly identified planet candidate, HD 137010 b, looks strikingly Earth-like in size and orbit — but it may be colder than Mars due to its dimmer star. If it has a thick enough atmosphere, though, this icy world could still surprise us.",
      "content": "Astronomers have identified a possible Earth-like planet called HD 137010 b that may share many similarities with our world. However, there is one striking difference. It could be even colder than the permanently frozen surface of Mars.\n\nThe discovery comes from continued analysis of data collected by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, which ended its mission in 2018. Researchers reviewing that archive have uncovered evidence of a rocky planet slightly larger than Earth orbiting a Sun-like star about 146 light-years away.\n\nEarth-Like Orbit Near the Habitable Zone\n\nHD 137010 b is currently classified as a \"candidate,\" meaning it still needs additional observations to confirm its existence. Early calculations suggest it completes one orbit roughly every year, placing it at a distance from its star similar to Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\nThe planet also appears to lie near the outer boundary of its star's \"habitable zone,\" the region where temperatures could allow liquid water to exist on a planet's surface if the atmosphere is suitable. Planets beyond our solar system are known as \"exoplanets.\" If confirmed, this world could become the first Earth-size exoplanet in a yearlong orbit that passes in front of a nearby, bright Sun-like star, making it an especially valuable target for follow-up research.\n\nA World That May Be Colder Than Mars\n\nDespite its promising orbit, the planet may receive far less warmth than Earth does. Scientists estimate it gets under one third of the heat and light our planet receives from the Sun. Although its host star belongs to a similar stellar class as our Sun, HD 137010 is cooler and less luminous.\n\nAs a result, surface temperatures on HD 137010 b could reach no higher than minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 68 degrees Celsius). For comparison, Mars averages about minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 65 degrees Celsius). That means this potential Earth twin could be even colder than the Red Planet.\n\nWhy Confirmation Will Be Difficult\n\nTo move from \"candidate\" to \"confirmed,\" astronomers must detect repeated transits. A transit occurs when a planet crosses in front of its star from our point of view, briefly dimming the starlight in a small eclipse.\n\nIn this case, scientists observed only a single \"transit\" during Kepler's extended K2 mission. During that event, the planet's shadow took about 10 hours to cross the star's face, compared with roughly 13 hours for Earth crossing the Sun as seen from a distant vantage point. Using the duration of that crossing and computer models of the system, researchers estimated the planet's likely orbital period.\n\nEven though this single detection was unusually precise, confirmation requires seeing the same event happen again at regular intervals. That will not be easy. Because the planet appears to orbit at a distance similar to Earth's, transits would occur only about once per year. Planets in tighter, shorter orbits pass in front of their stars more frequently, which makes them easier to detect (it's a big reason why exoplanets with Earth-like orbits are so hard to detect in the first place).\n\nFuture confirmation may come from NASA's TESS (the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) or from the European Space Agency's CHEOPS (CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite). If not, astronomers may need to wait for more advanced space telescopes to gather additional evidence.\n\nCould a Thick Atmosphere Make It Warmer?\n\nAlthough the planet may be extremely cold, researchers say it is still possible that HD 137010 b could support milder conditions. Climate modeling suggests that with a denser atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, the planet might trap enough heat to allow liquid water to exist.\n\nBased on atmospheric simulations, the team estimates a 40% chance that the planet lies within the \"conservative\" habitable zone and a 51% chance that it falls within the broader \"optimistic\" habitable zone. At the same time, there is roughly a 50-50 chance that it actually orbits beyond the habitable zone altogether.\n\nThe findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on Jan. 27, 2026, in a paper titled \"A Cool Earth-sized Planet Candidate Transiting a Tenth Magnitude K-dwarf From K2.\" The international research team was led by astrophysics Ph.D. student Alexander Venner of the University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists search for planets outside our solar system, called exoplanets, that might be similar to Earth. Finding such planets helps us learn about where life could exist beyond our planet.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers discovered a new planet candidate named HD 137010 b. It is about the size of Earth and orbits a star like our Sun, located 146 light-years away. The planet takes nearly a year to circle its star, similar to Earth's orbit. This discovery came from studying old data collected by NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope.\n\n**Impact** – This planet candidate is special because it is the first Earth-size planet found with a year-long orbit around a bright, nearby star. However, it may be much colder than Mars because its star is dimmer and cooler than the Sun. Scientists estimate surface temperatures could drop to minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the cold, if HD 137010 b has a thick atmosphere, it might trap heat enough to allow liquid water, which is important for life.\n\n**What's next step** – To confirm this planet really exists, astronomers need to observe it passing in front of its star again, which will likely take about a year. Future space telescopes like NASA’s TESS or ESA’s CHEOPS might help detect more transits. If confirmed, this planet will be a key target to study atmospheres and search for signs of habitability.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new Earth-size planet candidate with a year-long orbit around a nearby star offers a rare chance to study a world that might be cold but potentially habitable if it has a thick atmosphere.",
