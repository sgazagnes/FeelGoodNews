Faster regrowth also means more carbon captured from the atmosphere. The study points to smarter reforestation strategies that work with nature rather than relying on fertilizers.",
      "content": "Newly published research finds that tropical forests can rebound up to twice as fast after deforestation when their soils contain enough nitrogen. The study shows that what happens below ground plays a major role in how quickly forests return after land has been cleared.\n\nScientists led by the University of Leeds launched the largest and longest experiment ever designed to examine how nutrients shape forest regrowth. The work focused on tropical areas previously cleared for activities such as logging and agriculture.\n\nTracking Forest Regrowth Over Decades\n\nThe researchers selected 76 forest plots across Central America and monitored them for as long as 20 years. Each site differed in age and size, allowing the team to follow how trees grew and died as forests recovered over time.\n\nTo test the role of nutrients, the plots received different treatments. Some were given nitrogen fertilizer, others phosphorus fertilizer, some received both nutrients, and some were left untreated. This approach allowed the scientists to directly compare how forests responded under different soil conditions.\n\nNitrogen Emerges as a Key Driver\n\nThe results showed that soil nutrients strongly influence how quickly tropical forests regrow. During the first 10 years of recovery, forests with adequate nitrogen rebounded at about twice the rate of those lacking it. Phosphorus alone did not produce the same effect.\n\nThe study included researchers from the University of Glasgow, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Yale University, Princeton University, Cornell University, the National University of Singapore, and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. The findings were published on January 13 in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nImplications for Climate and Reforestation\n\nLead author Wenguang Tang, who carried out the research while completing his PHD at the University of Leeds, said: \"Our study is exciting because it suggests there are ways we can boost the capture and storage of greenhouse gases through reforestation by managing the nutrients available to trees.\"\n\nAlthough nitrogen fertilizer was used in the experiment, the researchers do not recommend fertilizing forests. Widespread fertilizer use could lead to harmful side effects, including emissions of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas.\n\nInstead, the team suggests practical alternatives. Forest managers could plant trees from the legume (bean) family, which naturally add nitrogen to the soil. Another option is restoring forests in areas that already have sufficient nitrogen due to the effects of air pollution.\n\nWhy Faster Regrowth Matters for the Climate\n\nTropical forests are among the world's most important carbon sinks. They help slow climate change by removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in trees, a process known as carbon sequestration.\n\nThe researchers estimate that if nitrogen shortages affect young tropical forests worldwide, about 0.69 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide may be failing to be stored each year. That amount is roughly equal to two years of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in the U.K.\n\nPolicy Relevance After COP 30\n\nThe study is released just weeks after the close of COP 30 in Brazil, where the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) fund was announced. The initiative aims to help tropical forest countries protect existing forests and restore those that have been damaged.\n\nPrincipal investigator Dr. Sarah Batterman, an Associate Professor in Leeds' School of Geography, said: \"Our experimental findings have implications for how we understand and manage tropical forests for natural climate solutions.\n\n\"Avoiding deforestation of mature tropical forests should always be prioritized, but our findings about nutrient impacts on carbon sequestration is important as policymakers evaluate where and how to restore forests to maximize carbon sequestration.\"",

      "summary": "Scientists believe the map could shed light on how Antarctica's vast ice sheet will respond to climate change.",
      "content": "The landscape beneath Antarctica's icy surface revealed in unprecedented detail\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Mark Poynting , Climate researcher and Erwan Rivault , Senior data designer Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nA new map has unmasked the landscape beneath Antarctica's ice in unprecedented detail, something scientists say could greatly enhance our understanding of the frozen white continent. Researchers used satellite data and the physics of how Antarctica's glaciers move to work out what the continent might look like beneath the ice. They found evidence of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, and say their maps of some of Antarctica's hidden mountain ranges are clearer than ever before. While the maps are subject to uncertainties, the researchers believe the new details could shed light on how Antarctica will respond to climate change - and what that means for sea-level rise.\n\n\"It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on,\" lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News. Thanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery. In fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's \"underbelly\" – the topography beneath the ice sheet. But researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made. \"I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once,\" said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. \"I think that's amazing.\"\n\nTraditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to \"see\" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks. But these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps. “If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham. So the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks. “It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden. “And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.” While we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice.\n\n\"I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there,\" said Ockenden. \"It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'.\" One intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin. The channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies.\n\nThe researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties. And much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice. But other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward. \"This is a really useful product,\" said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping. \"It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys,\" he added. A more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say. That is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in a warming climate. And that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science. “[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell. The study is published in the academic journal, Science.",

      "title": "NASA Data Helps Maine Oyster Farmers Choose Where to Grow",
      "summary": "NASA satellites are helping Maine oyster farmers pick better sites and plan when oysters will be ready to harvest.",
      "content": "When oyster farmer Luke Saindon went looking for a place to grow shellfish in Maine, he knew that picking the wrong patch of water could sink the farm before it began. So Saindon did something oyster farmers couldn’t have done a generation ago: He used NASA satellite data to view the coastline from space.\n\n“Starting a farm is a big venture,” said Saindon, the director for The World Is Your Oyster farm in Wiscasset, Maine. “If you choose the wrong spot, you can blow through a lot of money without ever bringing oysters to market.”\n\nNASA satellites had been passing over these waters for years, recording temperatures and other conditions. Using a site-selection tool created by University of Maine researchers, Saindon examined satellite maps showing where water temperatures and food levels might be best for growing oysters. The maps pointed him toward a wide, shallow bay near his home. Four years later, the farm is still there — and the oysters are thriving.\n\nLuke Saindon, director of The World Is Your Oyster farm in Wiscasset, Maine, checks oyster cages on the farm’s floating platform. © Jacqueline Clarke/The World Is Your Oyster, used with permission\n\nSaindon believes that using the satellite data to select his oyster farm site resulted in faster-than-average growth rates.\n\n“This is an example of how NASA’s Earth science program supports our nation,” said Chris Neigh, the Landsat 8 and 9 project scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “We collect global data, but its value grows when it’s used locally to help communities work smarter and make their livelihoods more sustainable.”\n\nFrom orbit to oyster\n\nThat same satellite-based approach is now the foundation of a study published Jan. 15 in the journal Aquaculture. Led by University of Maine scientists Thomas Kiffney and Damian Brady, the research demonstrates how temperature data from Landsat — the joint NASA and U.S. Geological Survey mission — combined with European Sentinel-2 satellite estimates of oyster food availability, namely plankton, can predict how quickly eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) reach market size.\n\nThe team built a satellite data–driven model of how oysters divide their energy among growth, survival, and reproduction. Feed the model sea surface temperature and satellite estimates of chlorophyll and particulate organic matter — signals of how much plankton and other edible particles are in the water — and it predicts how fast oysters will grow, a big step beyond just spotting good or bad sites for farms.\n\n“By showing where oysters grow faster, the model can help farmers plan ahead,” Kiffney said. “That could mean better decisions about when to seed, when to harvest, and how much product to expect, all of which reduces financial risk.”\n\nThat kind of insight is increasingly valuable in Maine, where oyster farming has grown rapidly over the last decade. From 2011 to 2021, the industry’s value increased 78%, rising from about $2.5 million to more than $10 million. As the sector scales up, understanding the finer details of Maine’s coastal waters has become essential — and that’s where NASA satellites come in.\n\nThe stakes are considerable. “It takes two to three years of scoping in order to get your permit to grow, and then it can take two years for those oysters to reach market,” Brady said. “So if you’ve chosen the wrong site, you're four years in the hole right off the bat.”\n\nSharper eyes on coast\n\nMaine’s coastline measures about 3,400 miles (5,500 kilometers) if you follow the tide line. It is a coast of drowned valleys and glacier-scoured granite. Water depth, temperature, and circulation can shift dramatically within a few miles. This complexity makes oyster site selection notoriously difficult, and some satellites that see the coast in broad strokes miss the small, patchy places where oysters live.\n\n“What makes Landsat so powerful for aquaculture is its ability to see finer-scale patterns along the coast,” where farmers put oyster cages in the water, Neigh said.\n\nThis false-color image from Landsat 9’s Thermal Infrared Sensor, acquired Oct. 11, 2025, shows the thermal signature of waters off the coast of Maine — revealing finer-scale temperature differences between neighboring coves. Cooler waters appear purple and blue, while warmer water shows up in orange and yellow. NASA/Ross Walter and Allison Nussbaum\n\nLandsat 8 and 9’s pixels — 98 to 328 feet (30 to 100 meters) across — are able to distinguish more subtle temperature differences between neighboring coves. For a cold-blooded oyster, those distinctions can translate into months of growth. Warm water accelerates feeding and shell development. Cold water slows both.\n\nA challenge for satellites is clouds. Maine’s sky is frequently overcast, and together Landsat 8 and 9 pass over any given point only every eight days. To work around this, the research team analyzed 10 years of Landsat data (2013–2023) and built seasonal “climatologies,” or average temperature patterns for every 98-foot (30-meter) pixel along the coast. Sentinel-2 imagery added estimates of chlorophyll and particulate organic matter, the drifting microscopic food that oysters pull from the water column with rhythmic contractions of their gills.\n\nField tests at multiple sites showed the technique’s accuracy. “We validated the model against seven years of field data,” Brady said. “It’s a strong indication that these remotely sensed products can inform not just where to grow, but how long it will take to harvest.”\n\nTurning satellite science into tools for growers\n\nThe University of Maine team is now developing an online tool to put this model into practice. A grower will be able to click on a coastal location and receive an estimate for time-to-market.\n\nThe researchers also assist with workshops through Maine’s Aquaculture in Shared Waters program, teaching farmers how to interpret temperature and water clarity data and apply them to their own sites.\n\nMonique Boutin, an aquaculture technician with The World Is Your Oyster farm, sorts oysters during harvest work on the water in Maine. © Nina Boutin/The World Is Your Oyster, used with permission\n\nFor farmers like Saindon, that translates into something simpler: confidence and efficiency. “Having these kinds of tools lowers the barrier for new people to get into aquaculture,” he said. “It gives you peace of mind that you’re not just guessing.”\n\nThe Maine project is helping pave the way for other NASA missions. The PACE satellite (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) launched in 2024 and is now delivering hyperspectral observations of coastal waters. Where earlier sensors could estimate how much plankton was present, PACE can begin to identify the different plankton species themselves. For oysters, mussels, and other filter feeders, that specificity matters. Not all plankton are equal food: Different kinds offer different nutrition, and some plankton are harmful to oysters.\n\nA next step will be turning that richer picture of coastal life into forecasts people working on the water can use, helping farmers trade some of the coast’s mystery for evidence they can apply to their harvest.\n\nBy Emily DeMarco\n\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.",

Las condiciones del agua, como la temperatura y la cantidad de alimento, cambian mucho a lo largo de la costa, y escoger un mal lugar puede costar a los agricultores años y mucho dinero.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Luke Saindon, un agricultor de ostras en Maine, usó mapas especiales hechos con datos de satélites de la NASA para encontrar el mejor lugar para su granja. Estos satélites miden la temperatura del agua y la cantidad de pequeños organismos llamados plancton que comen las ostras. Científicos de la Universidad de Maine combinaron estos datos para crear un modelo que predice qué tan rápido crecerán las ostras en diferentes lugares.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta nueva forma de usar los datos de satélites ayuda a los agricultores a saber no solo dónde cultivar, sino también cuándo sembrar y cosechar las ostras. Reduce los riesgos financieros al dar una idea clara del tiempo que tardan las ostras en crecer. El modelo fue probado con siete años de datos reales y resultó preciso, haciendo que la cría de ostras sea más inteligente y confiable.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El equipo de la Universidad de Maine está creando una herramienta en línea para que los agricultores puedan consultar fácilmente predicciones de crecimiento para cualquier lugar costero. Nuevos satélites como PACE pronto ofrecerán información aún más detallada sobre los tipos de plancton en el agua, ayudando a entender mejor la calidad de la comida de las ostras y a mejorar las cosechas.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Los datos satelitales de la NASA están guiando a los cultivadores de ostras de Maine para elegir mejores sitios y hacer crecer las ostras más rápido, haciendo la agricultura más fácil y con menos riesgos.\n",

      "title": "This tech could keep EVs from stressing the grid — and save everyone money",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "If you’re a typical American, you get home from work and start flipping switches and turning knobs — doing laundry, cooking dinner, watching TV. With so many other folks doing the same, the strain on the electrical grid in residential areas is highest at this time. That demand will only grow as the world moves away from fossil fuels, with more people buying induction stoves, heat pumps, and electric vehicles.\n\nThat’s a challenge for utilities, which are already managing creaky grids across the United States, all while trying to meet a growing demand for power. So they’re now trying to turn EVs from a burden into a boon. More and more models, for instance, feature “vehicle-to-grid,” or V2G, capabilities, meaning they can send power to the grid as needed. Others are experimenting with what’s called active managed charging, in which algorithms stagger when EVs charge, instead of them all drawing energy as soon as their owners plug in. The idea is for some people to charge later, but still have a full battery when they leave for work in the morning.\n\nA new report from the Brattle Group, an economic and energy consultancy, done for EnergyHub, which develops such technology, has used real-world data from EV owners in Washington state to demonstrate the potential of this approach, both for utilities and drivers. They found that an active managed charging program saves up to $400 per EV each year, and the vehicles were still always fully charged in the morning. Utilities, too, seem to benefit, as the redistributed demand results in less of a spike in the early evening. That, in turn, would mean that a utility can delay costly upgrades — which they need in order to accommodate increased electrification — saving ratepayers money.\n\nActive managed charging works in conjunction with something called “time of use,” in which a utility charges different rates depending on the time of day. Between 4 pm and 9 pm, when demand is high, rates are also high. But after 9 pm, they fall. EV owners who wait until later in the evening to charge pay less for the same electricity.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nTime-of-use pricing discourages energy use when demand is highest, lightening the load and reducing how much electricity utilities need to generate. But there’s nothing stopping everyone from plugging in as soon as cheaper rates kick in at 9 p.m. As EV adoption grows, that coordination problem can create a new spike in demand. “An EV can be on its own twice the peak load of a typical home,” said Akhilesh Ramakrishnan, managing energy associate at the Brattle Group. “You get to the point where they start needing to be managed differently.”\n\nThat’s where active managed charging comes in. Using an app, an EV owner indicates when they need their car to be charged, and how much charge their battery needs for the day. (The app also learns over time to predict when a vehicle will unplug.) When they get home at 6 pm, the owner can plug in, but the car won’t begin to charge. Instead, the system waits until some point in the night to turn on the juice, leaving enough time to fully charge the vehicle by the indicated hour. “If customers don’t believe that we’re going to get them there, then they’re not going to allow us to control their vehicle effectively,” said Freddie Hall, a data scientist at EnergyHub.\n\nThe typical driver only goes 30 miles in a day, Hall added, requiring about two hours of charging each night. By actively managing many cars across neighborhoods, the system can more evenly distribute demand throughout the night: Folks will leave for work earlier or later than their neighbors, vehicles with bigger batteries will need more time to charge, and some will be almost empty while others may need to top up.\n\nThey’re all still getting the lower prices with time of use rates, but they’re not taxing the grid by all charging at 9 pm. “The results are actually very, very promising in terms of reducing the peak loads,” said Jan Kleissl, director of the Center for Energy Research at the University of California, San Diego, who wasn’t involved in the report. “It shows big potential for reducing costs of EV charging in general.”\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nActive managed charging would allow the grid to accommodate twice the number of EVs before a utility has to start upgrading the system to handle the added load, according to the report. (And consider all the additional demand for energy from things like data centers.) Those costs inevitably get passed down to all ratepayers. But, the report notes, active managed charging could delay those upgrades by up to a decade. “As EVs grow, if you don’t implement these solutions, there’s going to be a lot more upgrades, and that’s going to lead to rate impacts for everyone,” Ramakrishnan said.\n\nAt the same time, EVs could help reduce those rates in the long term, thanks to V2G, a separate emerging technology. It allows a utility to call on EVs sitting in garages as a vast network of backup power. So when demand surges, those vehicles can send power to the grid for others to use, or just power the house they’re sitting in, essentially removing the structure from the grid and lowering demand. (And think of all the fleets of electric vehicles, like school buses, with huge batteries to use as additional power.) With all that backup energy, utilities might not need to build as many costly battery facilities of their own, projects that ratepayers wouldn’t need to foot the bill for.\n\nActive managed charging and V2G could work in concert, with some batteries draining at 6 pm as they provide energy, then recharging later at night. But that ballet will require more large-scale experimentation. “How are we going to fit in discharging a battery, as well as charging it overnight?” Hall said. “Because you do want it available the next day.”\n\nTo cut greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible, the world needs more EVs. Now it’s just a matter of making them benefit the grid instead of taxing it.",

      "personality_title": "New charging technology helps electric cars ease pressure on power grids and save money",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context**  \nAs more people buy electric vehicles (EVs) and electric appliances, the demand for electricity in homes is increasing, especially in the evening when many use appliances at the same time. This puts a lot of pressure on the electrical grid, which supplies power to homes and businesses. Utilities face the challenge of meeting this growing demand without costly upgrades.\n\n**What happened**  \nA new study from the Brattle Group, using data from EV owners in Washington state, shows that a technology called active managed charging can help. This system uses smart apps to control when EVs charge, making sure cars are fully charged by morning but avoiding everyone charging at the same time in the evening. This spreads out electricity use overnight and takes advantage of lower electricity prices after 9 pm. The study found this method can save EV owners up to $400 a year and reduce peak electricity demand for utilities.\n\n**Impact**  \nThis approach helps utilities avoid costly upgrades to the power grid by reducing the biggest spikes in electricity use. It can delay expensive improvements by up to ten years, saving money for everyone who pays for electricity. It also works alongside another technology called vehicle-to-grid (V2G), where EVs can send stored electricity back to the grid during busy times, acting like backup batteries. Together, these technologies could make electric cars a helpful part of the power system instead of a problem.\n\n**What's next step**  \nMore testing and larger projects will be needed to figure out how to best combine active managed charging and V2G. Researchers want to ensure cars can give power to the grid when needed and still be fully charged for drivers the next day. As more people switch to EVs, these technologies will be important to keep electricity reliable and affordable.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**  \nSmart charging technology can help electric cars save money, reduce stress on power grids, and delay costly upgrades as more people switch to cleaner energy.\n",

Cela répartit la consommation d'électricité pendant la nuit et profite des tarifs plus bas après 21h. L'étude a montré que cette méthode peut faire économiser jusqu'à 400 $ par an aux propriétaires de VE et réduire la demande maximale pour les fournisseurs.\n\n**Impact**  \nCette approche aide les fournisseurs à éviter des rénovations coûteuses du réseau électrique en réduisant les pics de consommation les plus importants. Elle peut retarder ces améliorations de dix ans, ce qui fait économiser de l'argent à tous les consommateurs d'électricité. Elle fonctionne aussi avec une autre technologie appelée véhicule-vers-réseau (V2G), où les VE peuvent renvoyer de l'électricité stockée au réseau lors des périodes de forte demande, agissant comme des batteries de secours. Ensemble, ces technologies pourraient faire des voitures électriques une aide pour le réseau plutôt qu'un problème.\n\n**Prochaine étape**  \nPlus de tests et de projets à grande échelle seront nécessaires pour déterminer comment combiner au mieux la recharge gérée active et le V2G. Les chercheurs veulent s'assurer que les voitures peuvent fournir de l'électricité au réseau quand c'est nécessaire tout en étant complètement chargées pour les conducteurs le lendemain.
