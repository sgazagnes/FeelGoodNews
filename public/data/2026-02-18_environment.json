      "title": "A massive climate resilience program is escaping Florida’s DOGE purge",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "When it comes to government spending, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is taking a cue from the Trump administration.\n\nAs his second term nears its end, DeSantis is spearheading a campaign to slash property taxes, which provide around 30 percent of local government revenue. He’s also looking to dramatically pare down state-funded programs, and he’s commissioned a state-level version of Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” to do so. DeSantis’s DOGE will be run by his hand-picked chief financial officer, the creator of a YouTube show called “Government Gone Wild.” In a signal of his seriousness about cutting spending, the governor’s proposed budget for this year is 10 percent lower than his 2019 budget in inflation-adjusted and per-capita terms.\n\nTo make these cuts happen, the Sunshine State’s climate programs are in the crosshairs.\n\nThe DOGE report that the governor’s office published last month singled out local efforts to confront climate change as examples of the “irresponsible spending” that Florida must end. The state task force targeted Jacksonville’s efforts to purchase electric vehicles, St. Petersburg’s hiring of a “sustainability and resilience officer,” and Miami’s efforts to build out buses and rail systems. The report directed specific ire at Palm Beach County’s Office of Resilience, which had a mandate to “reduce resident, business, and natural resource vulnerability” to disasters that “include flooding, more frequent and intense storms, extreme heat, [and] saltwater intrusion.”\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nDeSantis’s DOGE justified this criticism by appealing to a controversial report from the federal Department of Energy, which concluded that “scientific evidence does not support claims of a long-term increase in so-called ‘extreme’ weather events, including hurricanes, tornadoes, [and] floods.” Yet laws signed by DeSantis himself take the opposite view — and, perhaps as a result, the state’s largest climate resilience program is proving itself immune to the governor’s purge.\n\nDuring his first term as governor, DeSantis inaugurated a grant program known as “Resilient Florida,” which doles out millions of dollars a year to ward off flooding and sea level rise. The statute authorizing the program even “recognizes that the state is particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts from flooding resulting from increases in frequency and duration of rainfall events, storm surge from more frequent and severe weather systems, and sea level rise.” It requires that the state conduct a regular assessment of these threats.\n\nIn the five years since its inception, the Resilient Florida program has become one of the country’s most robust climate adaptation programs — rivaling not only those of any other state but also federal resilience efforts spearheaded by FEMA. Florida has distributed well over $1 billion in resilience money to local governments who then match the funding. By comparison, FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program has distributed around $5 billion to the entire country.\n\nResilient Florida has funded the construction of “living shorelines” to prevent erosion at the Pensacola naval base and the relocation of an island wastewater treatment plant in Fort Pierce to prevent flooding during high tide events. Palm Beach County, the same jurisdiction that Florida’s DOGE singled out for criticism, has received tens of millions of dollars in state funding. That money has helped raise an island park to protect against sea-level rise and has funded the construction of a $30 million storm drain system on a major road that’s seen routine flooding. (However, DeSantis vetoed an additional tranche of money for that project last summer.)\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nJim Mooney, a Republican state legislator representing the Florida Keys, said the program represents an example of smart state spending. Local governments must match each dollar of state grants, and Mooney said he believes the arrangement is a wise use of local property tax dollars.\n\n“The idea is you need to have shovel-ready projects, because getting these grants is hard,” said Mooney, one of the leading supporters of Resilient Florida. “That’s what you’re collecting people’s property taxes for, to some extent — to get that stuff done.” In Mooney’s island district, Resilient Florida has funded subterranean drainage pipes that reduce residential flooding from high tides.\n\nResilient Florida was originally set to expire in 2025, but the state legislature renewed it last year without any controversy; the bill that reauthorized the program passed both legislative chambers in less than a month and without any “nay” votes. Even as DeSantis is proposing to shrink the state budget by about 10 percent, his administration has firmed up the revenue source for Resilient Florida. The program will now draw its funding from the Seminole gaming compact, an agreement between the state and the Seminole tribe that governs revenue from online sports betting. It will be funded next year at $150 million. This time, it does not have an expiration date.\n\n“I think it would’ve continued to be funded [without the gaming revenue], it would’ve just been more of a rollercoaster ride,” said Mooney. “There was really no thought that it wasn’t going to move forward.”\n\nSuch programs are facing challenges in other parts of the country. The Trump administration has sought to terminate a key federal resilience grant program, and the Department of Homeland Security has paused almost all FEMA hazard mitigation spending. In Louisiana, which has long led the nation on state-level adaptation to climate change, a new governor, Jeff Landry, has halted efforts to fight sea-level rise and prevent coastal erosion. Landry last year canceled a massive sediment diversion project that would have built new coastal land, and the Republican has also meddled with governance for the landmark levee system that protects New Orleans.\n\nMathew Sanders, a policy expert at the Pew Charitable Trusts who helps states plan for disaster resilience, says the Resilient Florida’s durability comes down to economics. The Sunshine State’s coastline is an integral part of the state’s economy, and future growth depends on functional roads and sewage plants in beachfront towns. Even if the state wanted to cut Resilient Florida spending, it probably couldn’t afford to.\n\n“There’s a direct connection in Florida between the ecological health of the coastline and their ability to generate revenue,” said Sanders. “It’s so reliant on ecotourism, the pure beautiful beaches and the Everglades. The calculus is just different.”",

      "content": "THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nFinding parking in a city has always been a small daily nightmare. In places like Los Angeles, drivers can spend more than 80 hours a year circling the block, and cities across the globe, from London to Frankfurt, offer little relief. But Vienna is taking a different approach: instead of building more places to park, the Austrian capital is removing them. Surprisingly, it’s going pretty well.\n\nFaced with the dual challenge of climate change and limited space, Vienna is on a mission to swap asphalt for trees, bike lanes, and public seating. In doing so, it’s not just making the city cooler and more livable but also challenging a long-held assumption in urban planning: that cars should always come first.\n\nThe hidden cost of parking lots\n\nParking spots may be individually small, but collectively, they take up an enormous amount of space. In the United States, roughly 25 percent of developable urban land is devoted to parking. That’s a lot of heat-trapping pavement and a lot of real estate that could be doing something else.\n\nAll that asphalt contributes to rising summer temperatures, worsens flooding by blocking stormwater drainage, and prioritizes cars over people. Some cities are starting to realize the trade-offs aren’t worth it.\n\nVienna’s plan: break up the asphalt\n\nVienna has been quietly removing street parking in favor of public space, and not just in the outer districts. Even Neuer Markt, a historic square in the heart of the city, has been transformed. Once packed with parked cars, it’s now a pedestrian-friendly area with trees, benches, and open space for people to gather.\n\nThe city has more than 350 projects underway to replace parking spots with green infrastructure and public areas. That includes a major street reimagined as a Dutch-style cycling corridor, where 140 parking spaces were swapped for nearly a mile of bike lanes and plants.\n\nResidents can even apply to convert individual parking spots into what the city calls “neighborhood oases” made up of community gardens, playgrounds, or outdoor seating areas.\n\nOn top of this, in a major policy shift, Vienna now requires payment for all street parking city-wide, with a strict two-hour limit for non-residents. Free parking is a thing of the past.\n\nThe key to success: offer real alternatives\n\nOf course, making parking harder isn’t the point; making alternatives easier is. Vienna has invested heavily in a reliable, affordable transit system. “Park and ride” garages allow commuters to leave their cars outside the city center and connect seamlessly to subways or trams. The public transport system is fast, cheap, and well-connected, which is exactly what’s needed to encourage behavioral change.\n\n“We have to take people on board,” said Ina Homeier from Vienna’s Department of Urban Planning and Development. “We have to ask: how do you want your neighborhood? Do you want it to be filled with cars and without any trees, or do you want something different?”\n\nThis approach is working. The city’s investment in greener infrastructure is partly funded by parking fees, which now bring in around €180 million ($209 million) annually. Those funds go right back into cycling infrastructure and public transit. As a result, car use in Vienna has dropped by 37 percent compared to the 1990s.\n\nChanging car culture isn’t easy\n\nStill, resistance remains. “There’s been very complicated politics around taking back some of the space we’ve accorded the automobile,” said journalist Henry Grabar, author of Paved Paradise: How Parking Explains the World. For those who rely on cars, especially in places where transit isn’t a viable option, reducing parking can feel like an attack.\n\nThis tension is especially strong in countries like the United States, where 92 percent of households own at least one car. Drivers are a powerful political group, and car culture is deeply ingrained in urban policy.\n\nYet even in the US, cities are beginning to rethink their approach. Dallas turned a large downtown parking lot into a 3.7-acre park. San Francisco and New York have kept many of the “parklets” that popped up during the pandemic, turning curbside parking into outdoor dining and gathering spaces.\n\nRaising street parking fees has also proven an effective measure to manage demand and fund better alternatives. “There are lots of cities that are starting to realize the opportunity that parking offers for cities that have relatively limited budgets,” said Dana Yanocha of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy.\n\nAnd cities like San Jose and Austin are rolling back zoning laws that required new developments to include a minimum number of parking spaces, freeing up land for housing, green space, or businesses instead.\n\nIt’s not just about cars, it’s about choice\n\nAt the heart of all this is a simple idea: people need options. “You cannot reduce anything without offering a good alternative,” said Homeier. That’s especially true for transportation. When people have a cheap, fast, and pleasant alternative to driving, they’re far more likely to use it.\n\nVienna’s success didn’t come from banning cars. It came from making room for something better. The city is betting that the future of urban life is not about where to park, but about what kind of place we want to live in.\n\nDid this solution stand out?

      "summary": "Button cell batteries are the small, flat, round batteries found in watches, hearing aids, car...\nThe post The Earth911 Button Cell Battery Recycling Guide appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "Button cell batteries are the small, flat, round batteries found in watches, hearing aids, car key fobs, calculators, and medical devices. Although they are tiny, these batteries contain valuable materials that can be recovered and can harm the environment if not handled or disposed of correctly.\n\nThe main challenge in recycling button cells is their small size and the difficulty of sorting them. They are made in huge numbers and are rarely separated by type at collection points, which makes recovery hard. Most are thrown away with household trash. Lithium cells can cause fires, and all types add small amounts of heavy metals to landfills. Programs like Call2Recycle accept button cells, but not many people use them. This makes consumer education and easy drop-off locations just as important as the recycling technology.\n\nWhat’s Inside Button Cell Batteries\n\nButton cell batteries are made with different chemistries, including silver oxide, zinc-air, lithium (CR-type), and the older mercury oxide, which is now mostly banned. Each type has its own recycling challenges:\n\nLithium coin cells (CR series) are the most common type today and are used in watches, key fobs, and small electronics. They contain lithium metal, which can catch fire if it gets wet. These batteries last for years but can cause fires if they are damaged or thrown away incorrectly.\n\nSilver oxide (SR series) batteries are high-quality batteries used in watches and precision instruments. They contain silver, which is valuable and makes recycling worthwhile. Silver oxide batteries keep a steady voltage throughout their life, so they are often chosen for watches.\n\nZinc-air are primarily used in hearing aids. These batteries activate when a tab is removed, exposing zinc to air. Contains zinc and potassium hydroxide. Widely recycled through hearing aid provider programs.\n\nAlkaline button cells (LR series) use a similar chemistry to single-use AA batteries but are shaped like buttons. They are found in toys, calculators, and small flashlights. These batteries are less valuable for recycling than silver oxide or lithium types.\n\nButton cells made before 1996 may contain mercury. Although these are now rare, they should always be recycled properly and never thrown in the trash.\n\nWhy Button Cell Recycling Matters\n\nValuable Materials\n\nButton cells are increasingly targeted for recycling because of the value of the recoverable materials, given their small size and easy handling. Silver oxide batteries are particularly valuable—silver prices make recovery economically attractive. Lithium coin cells contain materials increasingly in demand for the growing battery industry.\n\nChild Safety\n\nButton batteries are very dangerous if swallowed by children. The American Academy of Pediatrics reports that button battery ingestions have gone up a lot, causing thousands of emergency room visits each year. If swallowed, these batteries can get stuck in the esophagus and cause severe burns in just two hours, which can lead to serious injury Recycling button batteries properly helps keep your home safe. Store used batteries in a secure container out of children’s reach until you can recycle them. Put tape on both sides of the battery to prevent sparks and reduce fire risk.ause fires.\n\nFire Prevention\n\nLithium coin cells can start fires if they touch metal objects or other batteries in the trash or recycling bins. If button batteries are crushed in garbage trucks or waste facilities, they can short out and ignite nearby materials. Recycling them through proper programs helps prevent these dangers.\n\nHow to Recycle Button Cell Batteries\n\nProfessional Replacement Services\n\nFor high-end watches, a jeweler or watch repair shop will usually replace the battery and recycle the old one responsibly. Ask if they recycle the old battery—most do, since silver oxide batteries are valuable. Hearing aid providers also usually accept used zinc-air batteries and have recycling programs.\n\nDrop-Off Locations\n\nRetailers: Many stores that sell button batteries will also take them back for recycling. Ask at watch departments, hearing aid centers, or electronics stores.\n\nThe Battery Network (formerly Call2Recycle): Use their drop-off locator to find places that accept button cells. Stores like Best Buy, Staples, and many hardware stores participate.\n\nHousehold Hazardous Waste (HHW) Programs: Many cities and towns have HHW collection events or permanent sites that accept button batteries. You can find your local program using Earth911’s HHW search.\n\nMail-In Programs\n\nThe Battery Network Store sells prepaid mail-in recycling boxes that accept button cells and other types of household batteries.\n\nWe Recycle Battery Box offers household battery recycling kits that accept button cells. Prices start at $121.95 and include a prepaid return shipping label.\n\nTerraCycle Regulated Waste provides battery recycling containers that can be used for button cell batteries.\n\nSafe Handling Tips\n\nTake steps to ensure that your button cell batteries make their recycling journey safely:\n\nTape the terminals: Put clear tape over both sides of the button battery to prevent short circuits during storage and transport.\n\nStore securely: Keep used batteries in a small container with a lid, like a pill bottle or film canister, and store them out of reach of children and pets.\n\nDon’t mix with other batteries: Keep button cells separate from larger batteries to prevent accidental contact and shorts.\n\nNever put batteries in curbside recycling or trash bins: Button batteries can cause fires in garbage trucks and recycling facilities. Always use designated recycling programs.\n\nAct immediately if swallowed: If a child swallows a button battery, call the National Battery Ingestion Hotline at 800-498-8666 right away and go to the emergency room. Do not try to make the child vomit.\n\nWhat Happens to Recycled Button Batteries\n\nAt recycling facilities, button batteries are sorted by type using machines and by hand. Each kind of battery is then processed in a different way:\n\nSilver oxide batteries are processed to recover silver. The silver can be purified and reused in new batteries, electronics, jewelry, or for industrial uses.\n\nLithium coin cells are recycled using special methods to recover lithium, manganese, and steel parts.\n\nZinc-air batteries are processed so the zinc can be reused in new batteries or for galvanizing.\n\nState Requirements\n\nButton batteries are included in the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws being implemented in many states.\n\nAs of early 2026, eight states and the District of Columbia have enacted battery EPR laws with “all battery” programs that cover button cells: Vermont (the first, in 2014), California (2022), Washington (2023), Illinois (2024), Colorado and Nebraska (2025), Connecticut (2025), and Minnesota.\n\nThese programs require battery producers — not taxpayers — to fund statewide collection and recycling systems, with implementation dates staggered between 2026 and 2029. Check The Battery Network’s state law page for current requirements in your state.\n\nYou Are The First Step In The Circular Economy\n\nDespite their small size, button cell batteries deserve careful attention when it comes to disposal. Their valuable materials make recycling economically sensible, while child safety and fire prevention concerns make proper handling essential.\n\nTake advantage of professional replacement services that include recycling, use designated drop-off locations, or choose a mail-in program to ensure these tiny power sources are responsibly managed at end of their useful life.",

      "summary": "",
      "content": "This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Grist and Interlochen Public Radio in northern Michigan.\n\nMichigan might be at the forefront of a new clean fuel source — and it’s buried right under the state.\n\nLast month, Governor Gretchen Whitmer said her administration wants to make the state a hub for geologic hydrogen, a potentially untapped reserve of clean fuel below the Earth’s surface that could power the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nThe U.S. already produces millions of tons of hydrogen a year to power carbon-intense transportation sectors like heavy trucking and shipping, but it’s expensive and requires a lot of energy. Harnessing natural hydrogen could bring prices down and cut more emissions from those industries.\n\nHere’s what to know about this potential new source of clean energy:\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nHow does hydrogen form within the Earth?\n\nThere are several ways that large amounts of hydrogen may have formed within the Earth’s crust, according to Matt Schrenk, a geomicrobiology professor at Michigan State University. Scientists know that deposits of natural hydrogen are created when water reacts with iron-rich rocks. Another way hydrogen forms is when certain rocks decay over the course of millions to billions of years, but research hasn’t shown it can result in large stores. One theory suggests that hydrogen has been continuously seeping from the Earth’s core since the planet formed 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nBecause all of this occurs deep inside the Earth, naturally occurring hydrogen isn’t easy to get to without drilling.\n\nHow hydrogen naturally forms under the Earth’s surface. C. Bickel / Science (graphic); Geoffrey Ellis / USGS (data)\n\nWhy is Michigan a good place to look for it?\n\nA 2025 study from the U.S. Geological Survey, or USGS, mapped out areas around the country with a lot of potential for buried hydrogen, with Michigan identified as a bright spot. That’s because the state sits on top of what’s called the Midcontinent Rift. It’s where the North American continent started splitting apart more than 1 billion years ago, then stopped.\n\n“This represents, potentially, a pathway for which deep hydrogen can come up closer to the surface and be collected and extracted,” Schrenk said.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nAs for possible hot spots beneath the state, think of Michigan’s lower peninsula like a giant bowl — it’s called the Michigan Basin for this reason. The younger, newer rocks are typically in the center of this bowl in the middle of the state. Deeper, older material — places where hydrogen might have formed — is found closer to the bowl’s edges, where Detroit and Traverse City are situated today.\n\nStill, the authors of the USGS study noted that much of the hydrogen they outlined is likely “too deep, too far offshore or in accumulations too small to be economically recoverable.”\n\nBesides Michigan, the USGS study pointed to areas like southern Oklahoma and northeastern Kansas that similarly might be sitting on large reserves of geologic hydrogen.\n\nWhat is the climate connection?\n\nWhen burned, hydrogen releases water and heat — and zero carbon emissions — which makes it a clean source of energy that could reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. But because it’s generally hard to access natural hydrogen that comes from the Earth, industries have to produce it — hydrogen powers fuel cells for vehicles and is also a key ingredient in fertilizer. More of it could decarbonize sectors where electrification is difficult, like the shipping industry. But using industrial processes to produce hydrogen takes a lot of energy, usually requiring fossil fuels.\n\nThat’s why clean energy experts are excited about potential underground sources. Even though accessing the Earth’s hydrogen would require drilling, it would still use significantly less energy than producing hydrogen from scratch, according to Todd Allen, co-director of MI Hydrogen, a research institute at the University of Michigan.\n\n“You may have some local energy used to run the drill, but the amount of zero-carbon energy you could get if there’s a lot of geologic hydrogen I think is a bigger advantage,” Allen said.\n\nHow likely are we to actually use geologic hydrogen as a power source?\n\nMore research is needed to figure out exactly where to drill for it and whether it’s feasible to actually extract it.\n\n“OK, you find it, is there enough of it to be useful? Is it concentrated enough to be useful? Do you have to drill a hole 20 kilometers in the Earth to extract it?” Schrenk at MSU said. “We need the data about where it is to identify whether there are practical solutions to extract it.”\n\nAnd if large amounts of hydrogen are found, building up infrastructure like pipelines or processing plants would be expensive and time-consuming.\n\nSo what does the governor’s executive directive do?\n\nCurrent regulations around drilling “were all written assuming you’re drilling for something else, say, natural gas,” Allen said.\n\nGovernor Whitmer’s executive order will require state agencies to look at those existing laws and ask if anything needs to change for hydrogen drilling, Allen said. Reports from state agencies like the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy and the Public Service Commission will be filed by April.\n\nIt’s still “too soon to tell” how big of an industry geologic hydrogen could be, Allen said. “You’re sort of right there at the beginning of the story. And there’s some opportunities for people to sort of nudge that story in a good direction.”",
