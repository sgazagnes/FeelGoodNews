      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nScientists have found a way to make solar energy work better by breaking an old rule called the ‘reciprocity law.’ This law usually limits how much energy materials can absorb and emit.\n\n**What happened**\nResearchers discovered a special material that absorbs more sunlight than it gives off as energy. This means it can capture sunlight more efficiently than before.\n\n**Impact**\nThis new material could help solar panels use sunlight more effectively, cutting down on wasted energy and making green energy cheaper and cleaner.\n\n**What’s next**\nScientists will now work on turning this discovery into real products, hoping to improve solar collectors and bring better renewable energy solutions to the world.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nBreaking old rules with new materials might just be the key to capturing more solar energy and protecting our planet.",
