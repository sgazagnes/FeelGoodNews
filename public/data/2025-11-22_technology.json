      "title": "Century-old catalysis puzzle cracked by measuring a fraction of an electron",
      "summary": "Scientists have directly measured the minuscule electron sharing that makes precious-metal catalysts so effective. Their new technique, IET, reveals how molecules bind and react on metal surfaces with unprecedented clarity. The insights promise faster discovery of advanced catalysts for energy, chemicals, and manufacturing.",
      "content": "A research team from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities College of Science and Engineering and the University of Houston's Cullen College of Engineering has successfully identified and measured the fraction of an electron involved in catalytic manufacturing.\n\nTheir findings, published in the open-access journal ACS Central Science, clarify why precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum excel in catalytic processes. The results also point to new possibilities for designing advanced catalytic materials.\n\nWhy Catalysts Matter in Modern Industry\n\nIndustrial catalysts -- substances that reduce the amount of energy required for a given chemical reaction -- help manufacturers boost reaction speed, yield or efficiency when producing key materials. They play a crucial role in fields ranging from pharmaceuticals and batteries to petrochemical operations such as crude oil refining, enabling production systems to meet global demand.\n\nImproving catalyst speed, reliability and control has become a major objective for the massive fuels, chemicals and materials sectors. As these industries expand, the race to develop more efficient, lower-cost catalytic systems has intensified around the world.\n\nUncovering How Molecules Share Electrons With Metals\n\nWhen molecules encounter a catalytic surface, they exchange a portion of their electrons with the metal (in this case, gold, silver or platinum). This interaction temporarily stabilizes the molecules, allowing reactions to proceed. Scientists have suspected this behavior for over 100 years, yet the tiny fractions of an electron involved had never been directly measured.\n\nResearchers at the Center for Programmable Energy Catalysis, based at the University of Minnesota, have now demonstrated that this electron sharing can be measured directly using a technique they created called Isopotential Electron Titration (IET).\n\nA Clearer View of Catalyst Behavior\n\n\"Measuring fractions of an electron at these incredibly small scales provides the clearest view yet of the behavior of molecules on catalysts,\" said Justin Hopkins, University of Minnesota chemical engineering Ph.D. student and lead author of the research study. \"Historically, catalyst engineers relied on more indirect measurements at idealized conditions to understand molecules on surfaces. Instead, this new measurement method provides a tangible description of surface bonding at catalytically-relevant conditions.\"\n\nKnowing exactly how much electron transfer occurs at a catalyst surface is essential for understanding how effectively it will perform. Molecules that more readily share their electrons tend to bind more strongly and react more easily. Precious metals achieve the ideal level of electron sharing needed to drive catalytic reactions, yet the precise scale of this sharing had never been directly captured until now.\n\nIET as a New Tool for Catalyst Discovery\n\nThe IET technique can now be used to directly describe and compare new catalyst formulations, helping researchers identify promising materials more quickly.\n\n\"IET allowed us to measure the fraction of an electron that is shared with a catalyst surface at levels even less than one percent, such as the case of a hydrogen atom on platinum,\" said Omar Abdelrahman, corresponding author and an associate professor in University of Houston Cullen College of Engineering's William A. Brookshire Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. \"A hydrogen atom gives up only 0.2% of an electron when binding on platinum catalysts, but it's that small percentage which makes it possible for hydrogen to react in industrial chemical manufacturing.\"\n\nConnecting Nanotechnology, Machine Learning and Catalysis\n\nThe rapid growth of nanotechnology techniques for building catalysts, combined with machine learning tools that can search and analyze vast datasets, has already expanded the catalogue of known catalytic materials. IET provides a third, complementary approach by allowing researchers to examine catalyst behavior directly at the fundamental electronic level.\n\n\"The foundation for new catalytic technologies for industry has always been fundamental basic research,\" says Paul Dauenhauer, Distinguished Professor and director of the Center for Programmable Energy Catalysis at the University of Minnesota. \"This new discovery of fractional electron distribution establishes an entirely new scientific foundation for understanding catalysts that we believe will drive new energy technologies over the next several decades.\"\n\nPart of a Larger National Initiative\n\nThis discovery supports the broader mission of the Center for Programmable Energy Catalysis, one of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Frontier Research Centers. Since its launch in 2022, the Center has worked to develop next-generation catalytic technologies aimed at producing materials, chemicals and fuels through advanced dynamic catalyst systems.",

      "title": "Quantum computers need classical computing to be truly useful",
      "summary": "Conventional computing devices will play a crucial role in turning quantum computers into tools with real-world application",
      "content": "Yonathan Cohen at Quantum Machines speaking at AQC25 conference Quantum Machines\n\nA vital ingredient for making quantum computers truly useful just might be conventional computers. That was the message from a gathering of researchers this month, which explained that classical computers are vital for controlling quantum computers, decoding the results of their calculations and even developing new techniques for manufacturing quantum computers in future.\n\nQuantum computers are made from qubits – quantum objects that may come in the form of extremely cold atoms or tiny superconducting circuits. The more qubits that a quantum computer has, the more computationally powerful it gets.\n\nBut qubits are fragile, so they must be carefully calibrated, monitored and controlled. Otherwise, they can introduce errors to the calculations run on a quantum computer or make these devices inefficient. To control qubits, researchers turn to classical computing technologies – which they discussed at the AQC25 conference in Boston, Massachusetts, on 14 November.\n\nOrganised by Quantum Machines, which makes controllers for several different kinds of qubits, the AQC25 conference gathered more than 150 researchers, ranging from quantum computing professors to AI start-up CEOs. Across several dozen presentations, they elaborated on the role of conventional computing as an enabling technology – and sometimes the limiting factor – for the future of quantum computing.\n\nAccording to Shane Caldwell, a scientist at Nvidia, the expectation is that a fault-tolerant quantum computer for useful problems will be made possible only if it is supported by a classical computing infrastructure at the petascale – the scale at which the world’s most powerful traditional supercomputers currently operate. While Nvidia doesn’t make its own quantum computing hardware, the firm recently launched a system for connecting quantum computing processors (QPUs) with traditional GPUs – the specialised computer components that are commonly used in machine learning and high-performance scientific computing.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Weekly The best of New Scientist, including long-reads, culture, podcasts and news, each week. Sign up to newsletter\n\nEven when a quantum computer is running efficiently, its output comes in the form of a set of quantum properties of its qubits. These must be decoded into more traditional formats in order to become useful – again requiring classical computing devices.\n\nPooya Ronagh from the Vancouver-based start-up 1Qbit spoke about this decoding and how it means that the speed of fault-tolerant quantum computers will be determined by the operating speed of its classical components, such as controllers and decoders. In other words, whether an expensive machine made from highly specialised quantum hardware has to run for a few days or a few hours to solve a computational problem might come down to its non-quantum parts.\n\nIn another presentation, Benjamin Lienhard at the Walther-Meissner-Institute for Low Temperature Research in Germany discussed how the use of traditional machine learning algorithms could make reading out superconducting qubits’ quantum states more efficient. Similarly, Mark Saffman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison reported on using classical neural networks to improve readout for qubits made from extremely cold atoms. Regardless of the type of qubit they study, researchers agreed that non-quantum devices will help those qubits become useful.\n\nIBM’s Blake Johnson presented on the details of the classical computing decoder that his team is developing as part of plans to build a quantum supercomputer by 2029. That supercomputer will use a non-traditional error-correction scheme, and efficient decoding is one of its biggest challenges.\n\n“As time goes by, we’re seeing that the more classical [computing] we bring closer to the QPUs, the more we can squeeze the integrated performance of the system to new limits,” said Yonathan Cohen at Quantum Machines.\n\nTraditional computers even have a role in assessing the behaviour of future quantum computers and how they will be built. For instance, Izhar Medalsy at a start-up called Quantum Elements said that the company’s AI-powered virtual versions – or “digital twins” – of quantum computers can inform actual hardware design.\n\nThe Quantum Scaling Alliance, co-led by 2025 Nobel Laureate John Martinis, was also represented at the conference. It exemplifies the importance of quantum and classical working together. The alliance connects qubit builders, traditional computing companies such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise and experts in materials simulations such as the software company Synopsys.\n\nThe consensus view from the conference was clear: the future of quantum computing is fast approaching, but that is in part thanks to experts who have spent their careers working firmly in the classical world.",

A gel-based synthetic tongue can give a ranking of foods’ spiciness without human discomfort.Credit: AFP/Getty\n\nA gel-based artificial tongue can determine the spiciness of a wide range of foods, from the forgiving bell pepper to the more formidable ‘facing heaven’ chili of Sichuan cuisine.\n\nThe device, as the researchers report1 in ACS Sensors, might be the secret to determining the heat levels of spicy foods without risking any human taste buds.\n\nThe artificial tongue itself is not a new feat. Scientists have created similar devices that can use electronic sensors to detect sweet, sour, spicy and umami tastes. But the authors of the new paper wanted to focus on spiciness in particular and to measure spice levels as precisely as possible, which is especially important for quality control in food, says co-author Jing Hu, a chemical engineer at the East China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai.\n\nTaming the burn\n\nThe team’s solution was “inspired by the spicy-neutralizing effect of milk”, they write in the paper. Milk “proteins that affect our perception of spiciness” relieve the burn of a spicy dish, explains Carolyn Ross, a food scientist at Washington State University in Pullman.\n\nThe synthetic tongue is made of a gel that contains milk powder, acrylic acid and choline chloride. When a current is applied to the gel, its chloride and hydrogen ions can conduct electricity because they are mobile. To monitor changes in conductivity, the scientists placed the gel between copper sheets and connected the whole contraption to a workstation that measures the electric current.\n\nCapsaicin — the compound that gives chilli peppers their spice — interacts with the milk proteins in the gel to form bulky complexes that disrupt ion flow. As a result, when the tongue encounters capsaicin, its conductivity drops.",

      "title": "Scientists reveal kissing began millions of years before humans",
      "summary": "Scientists have traced kissing back to early primates, suggesting it began long before humans evolved. Their analysis points to great apes and even Neanderthals sharing forms of kissing millions of years ago. The behavior appears to have persisted through evolution as a social or bonding tool. Yet its patchy presence across human cultures hints at a mix of biology and cultural invention.",
      "content": "A new investigation led by the University of Oxford reports that kissing may have originated in the shared ancestor of humans and other large apes roughly 21 million years ago. The research, published on November 19 in Evolution and Human Behavior, also indicates that Neanderthals likely practiced kissing.\n\nKissing is seen in many animal species, yet it poses an evolutionary puzzle: the act can spread disease and does not appear to directly boost survival or reproduction. Although kissing holds strong emotional and cultural meaning for many human groups, its evolutionary background has rarely been examined in detail.\n\nReconstructing Kissing on the Primate Family Tree\n\nIn this study, researchers conducted the first cross-species attempt to trace the origins of kissing using the evolutionary relationships among primates. Their results suggest that kissing has deep roots in large apes, emerging in their ancestor between 21.5 -- 16.9 million years ago. This behavior appears to have persisted through evolution and is still observed in most species within this group.\n\nThe team also concluded that Neanderthals, our extinct human relatives, likely kissed as well. This conclusion is supported by earlier research showing that humans and Neanderthals exchanged oral microbes (via saliva transfer) and interbred, implying that kissing was part of their interactions.\n\nDr. Matilda Brindle, lead author and evolutionary biologist at Oxford's Department of Biology, said: \"This is the first time anyone has taken a broad evolutionary lens to examine kissing. Our findings add to a growing body of work highlighting the remarkable diversity of sexual behaviors exhibited by our primate cousins.\"\n\nDefining and Identifying Kissing in Animals\n\nTo perform their analysis, the team first needed to define what counts as a kiss, since many mouth-to-mouth actions resemble the behavior without being the same thing. Because they were comparing species across a wide evolutionary range, the definition had to work universally. They defined kissing as non-aggressive, mouth-to-mouth contact that does not involve food transfer.\n\nAfter settling on this definition, the researchers reviewed scientific literature to identify modern primates known to engage in kissing. Their focus was on monkeys and apes that evolved in Africa, Europe, and Asia, including chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans.\n\nModelling the Evolution of Kissing\n\nThe next stage involved a phylogenetic analysis in which kissing was coded as a trait and placed onto the primate family tree. Using a statistical method (called Bayesian modelling), the team simulated millions of possible evolutionary scenarios to estimate how likely it was that various ancestors also kissed. The model ran 10 million times to provide strong statistical confidence in the results.\n\nProfessor Stuart West, co-author and Professor of Evolutionary Biology at Oxford, said: \"By integrating evolutionary biology with behavioral data, we're able to make informed inferences about traits that don't fossilize -- like kissing. This lets us study social behavior in both modern and extinct species.\"\n\nCultural Variation and Future Research\n\nThe researchers note that available data are still limited, especially beyond the large apes, but the project offers a foundation for future studies. It also gives primatologists a standardized way to report kissing behaviors in nonhuman animals.\n\n\"While kissing may seem like an ordinary or universal behavior, it is only documented in 46% of human cultures,\" said Catherine Talbot, co-author and Assistant Professor in the College of Psychology at Florida Institute of Technology. \"The social norms and context vary widely across societies, raising the question of whether kissing is an evolved behavior or cultural invention. This is the first step in addressing that question.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long wondered where kissing began and why it exists in humans. While many animals show mouth-to-mouth contact, the true origin of kissing and its evolutionary role have been unclear.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of Oxford studied kissing across primates, including chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans. They defined kissing as gentle, non-aggressive mouth-to-mouth contact without food exchange. Using family trees and statistical models, they found kissing likely started 16 to 21 million years ago in the common ancestors of great apes. The study also suggests Neanderthals, ancient human relatives, practiced kissing.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows kissing is not just a human cultural habit but an ancient behavior shared with other primates. It helps explain why kissing is common in many animals but appears in only about half of human cultures, mixing biology with cultural choices.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists want to collect more data on kissing in other primates and explore why it varies so much among human societies. This research opens new ways to study social bonding and communication in animals and humans.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Kissing began millions of years ago among early primates and Neanderthals, revealing it as a deep-rooted social behavior beyond human culture.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les scientifiques se sont longtemps demandé d'où venait le baiser et pourquoi il existe chez les humains. Bien que de nombreux animaux montrent un contact bouche à bouche, l'origine réelle du baiser et son rôle évolutif étaient peu clairs.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Des chercheurs de l'Université d'Oxford ont étudié le baiser chez les primates, comme les chimpanzés, les bonobos et les orangs-outans. Ils ont défini le baiser comme un contact bouche à bouche doux et non agressif, sans échange de nourriture. En utilisant des arbres généalogiques et des modèles statistiques, ils ont découvert que le baiser a probablement commencé il y a 16 à 21 millions d'années chez les ancêtres communs des grands singes. L'étude suggère aussi que les Néandertaliens, anciens parents humains, pratiquaient le baiser.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte montre que le baiser n'est pas seulement une habitude culturelle humaine, mais un comportement ancien partagé avec d'autres primates. Elle aide à comprendre pourquoi le baiser est courant chez de nombreux animaux mais présent dans seulement environ la moitié des cultures humaines, mêlant biologie et choix culturels.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques souhaitent recueillir plus de données sur le baiser chez d'autres primates et explorer pourquoi il varie autant entre les sociétés humaines. Cette recherche ouvre de nouvelles façons d'étudier les liens sociaux et la communication chez les animaux et les humains.\n\n**Phrase clé** – Le baiser a commencé il y a des millions d'années chez les premiers primates et les Néandertaliens, révélant un comportement social ancré bien au-delà de la culture humaine.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Los científicos han querido saber durante mucho tiempo de dónde viene el beso y por qué existe en los humanos. Aunque muchos animales muestran contacto boca a boca, el verdadero origen del beso y su papel evolutivo no estaban claros.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigadores de la Universidad de Oxford estudiaron el beso en primates como chimpancés, bonobos y orangutanes. Definieron el beso como un contacto boca a boca suave y no agresivo, sin intercambio de comida. Usando árboles genealógicos y modelos estadísticos, encontraron que el beso probablemente comenzó hace 16 a 21 millones de años en los antepasados comunes de los grandes simios. El estudio también sugiere que los neandertales, parientes humanos antiguos, practicaban el beso.\n\n**Impacto** – Este descubrimiento muestra que el beso no es solo un hábito cultural humano, sino un comportamiento antiguo compartido con otros primates. Ayuda a entender por qué el beso es común en muchos animales pero aparece en solo alrededor de la mitad de las culturas humanas, mezclando biología con decisiones culturales.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos quieren recopilar más datos sobre el beso en otros primates y explorar por qué varía tanto entre sociedades humanas. Esta investigación abre nuevas formas de estudiar el vínculo social y la comunicación en animales y humanos.\n\n**Frase clave** – El beso comenzó hace millones de años entre los primeros primates y neandertales, mostrando que es un comportamiento social muy antiguo más allá de la cultura humana.",
