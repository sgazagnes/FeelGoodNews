      "summary": "New research shows that aging blood can accelerate Alzheimer’s-like changes in the brain, while younger blood may offer protection.

The findings point to the blood as a powerful influencer of brain health—and a promising new therapeutic target.",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia worldwide and remains one of the most serious challenges facing public health systems. New findings published in the journal Aging-US suggest that substances circulating in the blood may influence how quickly the disease advances. In experiments with mice, researchers found that blood from older animals sped up Alzheimer's related damage, while blood from younger mice appeared to have a protective effect.\n\nThe study was conducted by scientists from the Instituto Latinoamericano de Salud Cerebral (BrainLat) at Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, working alongside collaborators from MELISA Institute, the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and Universidad Mayor.\n\nHow Alzheimer's Damages the Brain\n\nAlzheimer's disease is marked by the buildup of beta-amyloid protein (Aβ) in the brain. These proteins clump together to form plaques that interfere with communication between neurons and trigger processes that gradually damage brain tissue. While beta-amyloid is produced in the brain, recent research has suggested that it can also be detected in the bloodstream. This discovery has raised new questions about whether blood-based factors might play a role in how the disease progresses.\n\nTesting the Effects of Young and Old Blood\n\nTo investigate this possibility, the researchers used Tg2576 transgenic mice (a model widely used in Alzheimer's research). Over a period of 30 weeks, the mice received weekly blood infusions from either young or aged donor mice. The goal was to determine whether components in the blood could affect amyloid buildup in the brain as well as memory and behavior.\n\nAccording to Dr. Claudia Durán-Aniotz of the Instituto Latinoamericano de Salud Cerebral (BrainLat) at Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, the results highlight the importance of looking beyond the brain itself. \"This collaborative work between various institutions reinforces the importance of understanding how systemic factors condition the brain environment and directly impact mechanisms that promote disease progression. By demonstrating that peripheral signals derived from aged blood can modulate central processes in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's, these findings open new opportunities to study therapeutic targets aimed at the blood-brain axis,\" she explained.\n\nMeasuring Memory and Molecular Changes\n\nThe research team evaluated cognitive performance using the Barnes test and measured amyloid plaque accumulation through histological and biochemical methods. They also carried out a detailed proteomic analysis of brain tissue from the treated mice. This analysis identified more than 250 proteins whose activity levels had changed. Many of these proteins are involved in synaptic function, endocannabinoid signaling, and calcium channel regulation, offering possible explanations for the differences seen in brain health and behavior.\n\nMELISA Institute played a key role in analyzing the complex protein data. Mauricio Hernández, a proteomics specialist at the institute, noted the technical challenges involved. \"Within this study, we conducted a large-scale proteomic analysis that allowed us to generate excellent quality data in this complex matrix like plasma, a technical challenge for any proteomics laboratory. Thanks to our state-of-the-art equipment (timsTOF Pro2), we are proud to have contributed to the production of a robust and high-quality scientific article.\"\n\nWhat This Means for Future Alzheimer's Research\n\nThe findings add to growing evidence that circulating factors in the blood can directly affect the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. By identifying how these blood-based signals influence the brain, scientists may be able to uncover new treatment targets and develop strategies to slow or prevent disease progression. Future research will focus on pinpointing the specific factors involved and determining whether they can be safely targeted in people.\n\n\"It is a pleasure to contribute our proteomic capabilities to support innovative research initiatives like this study, which allow us to advance the knowledge and development of new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, which are currently a global health problem,\" said Dr. Elard Koch, Chairman of MELISA Institute.\n\nFunding and Research Support\n\nC.DA. was supported by ANID/FONDECYT Regular 1210622, ANID/PIA/ANILLOS ACT210096, the Alzheimer's Association (AARGD-24-1310017), ANID/FOVI240065 and ANID/Proyecto Exploracion 13240170 and MULTI-PARTNER CONSORTIUM TO EXPAND DEMENTIA RESEARCH IN LATIN AMERICA (ReDLat), supported by NIH research grant R01AG057234 funded by the National Institute of Aging (NIA) and the Fogarty International Center (FIC), an Alzheimer's Association grant (SG-20-725707-ReDLat), the Rainwater Charitable Foundation, and the Global Brain Health Institute with additional support from the Bluefield Project to Cure Frontotemporal Dementia, an NIH contract (75NS95022C00031), and NIA under awards R01AG075775, R01AG082056, and R01AG083799.

      "title": "Scientists uncover a hidden aging program in the gut that fuels cancer risk",
      "summary": "Although the gut renews itself constantly, its stem cells accumulate age-related molecular changes that quietly alter how genes are switched on and off. Scientists found that this “epigenetic drift” follows a clear pattern and appears in both aging intestines and most colon cancers. Some regions age faster than others, forming a patchwork of weakened tissue more prone to degeneration. Encouragingly, researchers showed this drift can be slowed—and partly reversed—by restoring iron levels or key cellular signals.",
      "content": "The human gut replaces its cells faster than any other tissue in the body. Every few days, fresh cells are produced by specialized stem cells that keep the intestinal lining healthy. Over time, however, these stem cells begin to accumulate epigenetic changes. These are chemical tags attached to DNA that work like on and off switches, controlling which genes stay active and which are turned down.\n\nA new study published in Nature Aging shows that these changes follow a clear pattern rather than appearing at random. The international research team was led by Prof. Francesco Neri of the University of Turin in Italy. The scientists identified a process they call ACCA (Aging- and Colon Cancer-Associated) drift, a gradual shift in epigenetic markers that becomes stronger as people age. \"We observe an epigenetic pattern that becomes increasingly apparent with age,\" says Prof. Neri, formerly a group leader at the Leibniz Institute on Aging -- Fritz Lipmann Institute in Jena.\n\nAging Patterns Linked to Cancer Risk\n\nThe genes most affected by this drift are those that help maintain normal tissue balance. Many of them are involved in renewing the intestinal lining through the Wnt signaling pathway. When these genes are altered, the gut's ability to repair itself begins to weaken.\n\nResearchers found that the same drifting pattern appears not only in aging intestinal tissue but also in nearly all colon cancer samples they analyzed. This overlap suggests that aging stem cells may create conditions that make cancer more likely to develop.\n\nA Patchwork of Aging Inside the Gut\n\nOne striking finding is that aging does not affect the intestine evenly. The gut is made up of tiny structures called crypts, each formed from a single stem cell. If that stem cell develops epigenetic changes, every cell within the crypt inherits them.\n\nDr. Anna Krepelova explains how this process unfolds. \"Over time, more and more areas with an older epigenetic profile develop in the tissue. Through the natural process of crypt division, these regions continuously enlarge and can continue to grow over many years.\"\n\nAs a result, the intestines of older adults become a mix of younger and much older crypts. Some regions remain relatively healthy, while others are more likely to produce damaged cells, increasing the chances of cancer growth.\n\nIron Loss Disrupts DNA Repair\n\nThe researchers also uncovered why this epigenetic drift happens. As intestinal cells age, they take in less iron while releasing more of it. This reduces the amount of iron (II) available in the cell nucleus. Iron (II) is essential for the proper function of TET (ten-eleven translocation) enzymes, which normally help remove excess DNA methylations.\n\nWhen iron levels drop, these enzymes no longer work efficiently. As a result, excess DNA methylations remain in place instead of being broken down.\n\n\"When there's not enough iron in the cells, faulty markings remain on the DNA. And the cells lose their ability to remove these markings,\" says Dr. Anna Krepelova. As TET activity declines, DNA methylations build up, key genes are switched off, and they \"fall silent.\" This chain reaction further speeds up epigenetic drift.\n\nInflammation Speeds Up the Aging Process\n\nAge-related inflammation in the gut makes the problem worse. The team showed that even mild inflammatory signals can disrupt iron balance inside cells and place additional stress on metabolism. At the same time, Wnt signaling weakens, reducing the ability of stem cells to stay active and healthy.\n\nTogether, iron imbalance, inflammation, and reduced Wnt signaling act as an accelerator for epigenetic drift. Because of this, aging in the intestine may begin earlier and progress faster than scientists previously believed.\n\nCan Gut Aging Be Slowed?\n\nDespite the complexity of these processes, the findings offer some hope. In laboratory experiments using organoid cultures, miniature intestinal models grown from stem cells, researchers were able to slow or partly reverse epigenetic drift. They achieved this by restoring iron uptake or by directly boosting Wnt signaling.\n\nBoth approaches reactivated TET enzymes and allowed cells to start clearing excess DNA methylations again. \"This means that epigenetic aging does not have to be a fixed, final state,\" Dr. Anna Krepelova says. \"For the first time, we are seeing that it is possible to tweak the parameters of aging that lie deep within the molecular core of the cell.\"",

      "title": "This natural amino acid could help stop cavities before they start",
      "summary": "Sugar-loving mouth bacteria create acids that damage teeth, but arginine can help fight back. In a clinical trial, arginine-treated dental plaque stayed less acidic, became structurally less harmful, and supported more beneficial bacteria. These changes made the biofilms less aggressive after sugar exposure. The results point to arginine as a promising, natural addition to cavity-prevention strategies.",
      "content": "When bacteria in the mouth break down sugars from food, they release acids that gradually erode tooth enamel and cause cavities. These bacteria do not live alone. They form dense, plaque-like structures known as \"dental biofilms\" that cling to the surface of teeth. Within these biofilms, acid production can accelerate tooth damage.\n\nResearchers have found that arginine, an amino acid naturally present in saliva, plays an important role in reducing tooth decay. Certain beneficial bacteria use an arginine deiminase system (ADS) to convert arginine into alkaline compounds that help counteract harmful acids. When more arginine is available, these protective bacteria tend to grow more easily, while acid-producing bacteria struggle to thrive. Earlier laboratory studies conducted outside the human body also suggested that arginine can change the overall makeup of dental biofilms.\n\nTesting Arginine Inside the Human Mouth\n\nTo confirm whether these effects also occur in real mouths, a research team led by Post.doc. Yumi C. Del Rey and Professor Sebastian Schlafer at Aarhus University in Denmark carried out a clinical study. Their findings were published in the International Journal of Oral Science.\n\nThe study included 12 participants who had active tooth decay. Each person received specially designed dentures that allowed researchers to collect intact dental biofilms from both sides of the jaw. Participants were asked to dip the dentures into a sugar solution for 5 minutes, followed immediately by either distilled water (as placebo) or arginine for 30 minutes. One treatment was applied to one side of the mouth, and the other treatment to the opposite side. This routine was repeated three times daily, with arginine always applied to the same side.\n\n\"The aim was to investigate the impact of arginine treatment on the acidity, type of bacteria, and the carbohydrate matrix of biofilms from patients with active caries,\" explains Sebastian Schlafer, professor at the Department of Dentistry and Oral Health. After 4 days, once the biofilms had fully formed, the dentures were removed for detailed examination.\n\nArginine Reduces Acid Levels After Sugar Exposure\n\nTo measure acidity inside the biofilms, researchers used a pH-sensitive dye known as \"C-SNARF-4.\" This dye allowed them to assess acidity in different areas of the biofilm. Biofilms that received arginine treatment showed noticeably higher pH levels, meaning lower acidity, at 10 and 35 minutes after exposure to sugar.\n\n\"Our results revealed differences in acidity of the biofilms, with the ones treated with arginine being significantly more protected against acidification caused by sugar metabolism\" says the first author, Yumi C. Del Rey.\n\nChanges in Biofilm Structure and Sugary Components\n\nThe team also examined structural components of the biofilms using fluorescently labeled lectins, which are proteins that bind to specific carbohydrates. Two major carbohydrate components were studied: fucose and galactose. These sugars make up a large portion of dental biofilms and are thought to contribute to the formation of \"acidic pockets\" that trap damaging acids.\n\nBiofilms exposed to arginine showed an overall decrease in fucose-based carbohydrates, which may reduce their ability to cause harm. Researchers also observed a structural shift in the biofilms. Galactose-containing carbohydrates became less abundant near the base of the biofilm and more concentrated toward the top, suggesting a reorganization that may limit acid buildup near tooth surfaces.\n\nShifting the Balance of Mouth Bacteria\n\nTo identify which bacteria were present, researchers analyzed bacterial DNA using \"16S rRNA gene sequencing.\" Biofilms treated with either arginine or placebo were largely dominated by Streptococcus and Veillonella species. However, arginine treatment led to a significant reduction in the mitis/oralis group of streptococci. These bacteria produce acid but are weak at generating alkali.\n\nAt the same time, arginine slightly increased the presence of streptococci that are better at metabolizing arginine. This shift helped raise pH levels inside the biofilm. Taken together, the findings show that arginine made dental biofilms less harmful by lowering acidity, altering carbohydrate composition, and reshaping the microbial community.\n\nA Safe and Promising Strategy Against Tooth Decay\n\nTooth decay affects people of all ages around the world. The researchers suggest that adding arginine to products such as toothpaste or oral rinses could help protect people who are especially prone to cavities. Because arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid produced by the body and found in many dietary proteins, it is considered safe and could even be suitable for use in children.",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 08 January 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00007-yA giant functional atlas of immune cells in a Chinese cohort reveals crucial differences with European and Japanese data sets.",
      "content": "Immune cells called T cells help the body to fight off infection.Credit: Dennis Kunkel Microscopy/SPL\n\nA cellular atlas that characterizes the functions of immune cells in more than 400 Chinese individuals has revealed key differences in the biology of people from different populations.\n\nThe study, published today in Science1, compiles a ‘multi-omic’ atlas of immune cells in the blood. It draws together data on genes, proteins, RNA and the epigenome to study how this group of cells works. Dubbed the Chinese Immune Multi-Omics Atlas (CIMA), the atlas finds important variation in immune-cell functions compared with those charted in similar data sets from European and Japanese cohorts.\n\n“By providing a data set that complements other Asian cohorts like the Japanese ImmuNexUT project, we have created a resource that allows for the discovery of biological mechanisms and genetic associations that would likely be missed in European-centric studies,” write the authors in a joint statement to Nature.\n\nDiverse data sets\n\nResearchers have created multi-omic atlases for several cell types, using them to tackle specific questions relating to the brain, Alzheimer’s disease and the immune system. But these atlases often rely mainly on data from people of European origin. This means that medicines designed on the basis of cell characteristics in these atlases might not be effective in individuals who have other ancestries.\n\nCellular atlases are unlocking the mysteries of the human body\n\nTo address this gap, Jianhua Yin at the Shanxi Medical University–BGI Collaborative Center for Future Medicine in Taiyuan, China, and his colleagues analysed more than 10 million immune cells in blood samples from 428 healthy Chinese adults at multi-omics levels.\n\nThe atlas provides biomolecular indicators for each individual, including metabolite profiles, blood biochemical markers, chromatin accessibility data and differences in gene expression across cell populations.\n\nThe researchers compared their data set to results from the OneK1K project, which analysed people with northern European ancestry2 , and the Japanese ImmuNexUT project3. They found that core immune pathways and cell types are the same in the different populations.\n\nBut there were differences in genetic regulation and in immune-cell states between the atlases. When it came to looking for variations near specific genes that influence how active a gene is, for example, the researchers found that more than 93% of these targets in the CIMA data overlapped with those in the Japanese cohort, but only about 44% of them overlapped with the European group.\n\nOne example of divergence is the rs11886530 gene variant, which is common in East Asian populations but rare in Europeans. In the CIMA data, this allele was found to regulate the circadian-clock genes NPAS2 and NR1D1 in immune cells called T cells. According to the authors, this mechanism has never been observed before in immune cells.\n\n“I think the atlas is a really clinically important resource,” says Kay Chung, an immunologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. “This could be useful for personalized medicine and also to check on drug interactions that might be specific to a certain population.”\n\nAge and sex differences\n\nThe group of people the authors studied were aged between 20 and 77 years and contained 189 men and 239 women, so there were enough participants to tease out variations in immune-cell behaviour related to age and sex.\n\nThey found that increased age was associated with having more white blood cells that drive inflammation, and with altered gene expression in dendritic cells, which act as messengers in the immune system.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have been studying immune cells to understand how the body fights infections. Most research so far has focused on people of European background, which means medicines made from these studies might not work as well for others.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers in China created a detailed map called the Chinese Immune Multi-Omics Atlas (CIMA). They studied over 10 million immune cells from 428 healthy Chinese adults, examining genes, proteins, and other molecules. They compared their findings with similar data from European and Japanese groups.\n\n**Impact** – The study found important differences in how immune cells work between Chinese people and those from Europe and Japan. For example, a gene variant common in East Asians affects immune cells in a way not seen before. This shows that immune systems can vary between populations, which matters for making better medicines that work for everyone.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists can now use this atlas to explore how these differences affect diseases and treatments. It can help develop personalized medicine tailored to people's genetic backgrounds and improve drug safety for different populations.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new detailed map of immune cells in Chinese people reveals unique differences that can help create better, more personalized medical treatments worldwide.",
