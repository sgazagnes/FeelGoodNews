      "content": "'Hermès of durian': The luxury fruit cashing in on China's billion-dollar appetite\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Koh Ewe Raub, Malaysia Share Save\n\nGetty Images China's surging demand for durians is shaping South East Asia's farming towns\n\nDriving around Raub, a small town in Malaysia, it's impossible to miss the prickly fruit that powers its economy. You can smell it from the steady stream of trucks winding through mountain roads, leaving a faint fragrance on their trails. You can see it too: the green spikes of a giant sculpture, murals painted fondly on low walls and road signs that proclaim: \"Welcome to the home of Musang King durians.\" A gold mining town in the 19th Century, Raub has seen its economy take on a new hue of yellow in recent years. Today it's better known as the land of the Musang King — a buttery, bittersweet variety that the Chinese have dubbed the \"Hermès of durians\", as prized as the French fashion house. Raub is one of many South East Asian towns that sit at the heart of a global durian rush, pumped by China's growing demand. In 2024, China imported a record $7bn (£5.2bn) worth of durians — a three-fold increase from 2020. This is where more than 90% of the world's durian exports are now headed. \"Even if only 2% of Chinese people want to buy durians, that's more than enough business,\" says Chee Seng Wong, factory manager of Fresco Green, a durian exporter in Raub. Wong recalls how farmers cut down durian trees to make room for oil palms, the country's main cash crop, during an economic downturn in the 1990s. \"Now it's the other way round. They're chopping oil palms to grow durians again.\"\n\nBBC/Koh Ewe Durians are the pride of Raub\n\nA very hungry China\n\nWith an aroma that has been likened to cabbage, sulphur and sewers — depending on who the nose belongs to — the durian packs a pungence so divisive that it's banned on some public transport and hotels. It has been maligned for gas leaks, and was the reason a plane was grounded after passengers remonstrated against the smell wafting from the cargo hold. Fans from the region have christened it the \"King of fruits\", but on the internet it has earned a less flattering tag — the world's smelliest fruit — as tourists unused to its odour seek it out with squeamish curiosity. Yet it has found a growing fanbase in China: as an exotic gift exchanged among the affluent; a status symbol to be unboxed on social media; and the star of culinary heresies from durian chicken hotpot to durian pizza. Thailand and Vietnam are the top durian suppliers to China, accounting for nearly all of its imports. Malaysia's share of the market is sprouting fast, having earned a reputation with premium varieties such as the Musang King. The average price of durian starts at less than $2 (£1.4) in South East Asia, where they are grown in abundance. But luxe versions like the Musang King could cost anywhere from $14 (£10) to $100 (£74) a pop, depending on their quality and the season's harvest. \"Once I ate Malaysian durian, my first thought was, 'Wow, this is delicious. I have to find a way to bring it to China',\" says Xu Xin, who has been sampling durians at a shop in Raub. The 33-year-old sells the fruit back home in northeastern China, and is on the hunt for the best durians to import.\n\nBBC/Koh Ewe Visitors to Raub are delighted with its durians\n\nWith her are two durian exporters from southern China, one of whom says business has been booming. The other expects it to continue: \"There are so many people who haven't eaten it yet. The market potential is huge.\" It's easy to see why they're so confident. Seated nearby is a large Chinese tour group — one of many that have been flocking to rural Malaysia for a bite of the fruit. Eagerly they dig into platters of durian, carefully arranged from the mildest to the richest. If eaten in the right order, locals say, fresh notes should emerge with each glob on the flight: caramel, custard and finally, an almost alcoholic bitterness heralding the Musang King. Such pedantry is perhaps why Malaysian durians have earned a special place on the Chinese table. \"Maybe in the beginning we only liked durians that were sweet. But now we look for things like fragrance, richness and nuanced flavours,\" Xu says. \"Nowadays there are more customers who walk into the shop and ask, 'Are there any bitter ones in this batch?'\"\n\nBBC/Koh Ewe Durians arranged from mildest (top left) to richest, ending with the Musang King (bottom right)\n\nRaub's durian dynasties\n\nJust hours before the durians ended up on Xu's plate, they were painstakingly harvested at a nearby farm owned by Lu Yuee Thing. Uncle Thing, as he's known in town, owns the durian shop, along with several farms. He is one of many success stories in Raub, where durians have made millionaires out of farmers. In family businesses like his, sons often help with transporting durians while daughters handle accounting and the finances. \"Durian has contributed a lot to the economy here,\" Uncle Thing says. Driving to his farm one morning, there is quiet pride in his voice as he points out the Japanese pickup trucks that have replaced the rickety jeeps he used to rely on for transporting crates of his fruit.\n\nBBC/Koh Ewe Uncle Thing is one of Raub's big durian success stories\n\nStill, farming is hard work. At 72, Uncle Thing wakes up at dawn every day and weaves around his hilly farm to collect ripened durians, either dangling from trees or nestling on nets close to the ground. A couple of years ago, a falling durian landed on his shoulder, leaving him with a throbbing pain that acts up now and then. \"It looks like farmers make easy money. But it's not easy,\" he says. Once harvested, the durians are brought to Uncle Thing's shop, where they are sorted into baskets ranging from Grade A, for the large and round ones, to Grade C, the small and odd-shaped. Sitting in the middle of the sorting floor is a lone basket reserved for Grade AA durians, the handsomest of the lot. Those will soon be flown to China.\n\nBBC/Koh Ewe The daily haul at Uncle Thing's farm\n\nA durian coup?\n\nChina's insatiable appetite for durians has shaped up to be a nifty diplomatic tool. Beijing has signed a flurry of durian trade agreements, touting them as a celebration of bilateral ties — not just with major producers like Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, but also budding suppliers like Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines and Laos. \"In this durian competition, everyone's a winner,\" declared a state media article in 2024. The deals also dovetail with China's investments in infrastructure in the region. The China-Laos Railway, launched in 2021, now transports more than 2,000 tonnes of fruit every day, most of them Thai durians. But this clamour to keep up with China's appetite comes at a cost. Food safety concerns about Thai durians erupted last year, after Chinese authorities found in them a carcinogenic chemical dye believed to make the durians more yellow. In Vietnam, many coffee farmers pivoted to durians, driving up global coffee prices that were already affected by severe weather. And in Raub, a turf war has broken out. Authorities felled thousands of durian trees they said were planted illegally on state land. Farmers say they have been using the land for decades without any issue, and allege they are now being forced to pay a lease to continue farming there, or face eviction.\n\nGetty Images Durian trees and oil palms dominate Raub's landscape\n\nMeanwhile, a coup may be on the way in China's island province of Hainan, where years of trial and error are bearing fruit. Its durian harvest for 2025 was expected to reach 2,000 tonnes. Like in so many industries, from renewables to AI, China has long pushed to be self-sufficient in food too. Even as it reaps the fruits of this durian diplomacy, it is eyeing what state media calls \"durian freedom\". \"For one thing, we won't have to rely on Thai and Vietnamese vendors when buying durians anymore!\" proclaimed an article in August.\n\nBBC/Koh Ewe Can Hainan unseat Raub in the durian supply chain?",

      "summary": "Over two-thirds of students choose not to live at university, latest figures suggest - but is it worth it?",
      "content": "My three-hour university commute is worth the £7,000 saving on halls\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Nathan Standley and Hayley Clarke Share Save\n\nAmelka Zambrzycka\n\nOn a packed morning train to Manchester, 19-year-old Amelka Zambrzycka is surrounded by commuters heading into work. There isn't a suitable bus from her mum's house in Horwich, on the other side of Bolton, so she has just walked the 25 minutes to the station - as she does every morning - despite the freezing weather. But Amelka isn't on her way to work. She's a first-year biology student, one of hundreds of thousands of undergraduates who now choose to live at home rather than paying for university halls. With the Ucas application deadline around the corner on Wednesday 14 January, thousands more will be considering whether doing the same might be worth it for them, too.\n\nMore than 700,000 \"commuter students\" are at universities across the UK. It has led to universities like Manchester creating dedicated social spaces for them to hang out in between lectures - complete with lounge seating, study areas, kitchen facilities, lockers and showers. It's just before 08:30 when Amelka arrives at the University of Manchester's commuter lounge. She can make a cup of tea or have some breakfast in the kitchen area, cram in some last-minute work in the study pods, or even grab a shower after an early morning gym session.\n\nAmelka Zambrzycka Amelka walks around 15,000 steps a day to get to and from university\n\nMany of her course mates are only just getting out of bed in their nearby halls of residence, ready for the first lecture of the day at 09:00. But Amelka has already been up for two hours, having just completed the first of two 90-minute journeys she takes every day between her mum's house and the city centre campus. The University of Manchester's own cost of living estimates suggest a first-year student can expect to spend £7,875 on accommodation alone in 2025/26. Together with everything from groceries and takeaways, to clothes and course materials, first-year students in Manchester this year will have estimated costs totalling £13,685, the university says.\n\nAmelka Zambrzycka Amelka's commute to university takes up three hours of her day there and back\n\nRenting and living costs vary widely across the country, but have been rising across the board in recent years. The Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) says students in England now need £61,000 over the course of a three-year degree \"to have a minimum socially acceptable standard of living\". Amelka's mum does not charge her rent, and even though she buys her own food and will spend about £700 this year on public transport, her costs are a fraction of what they would be if she lived nearer university. The latest figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) suggest the number of students who live in their own home, or their parents' home, during term time has been steadily increasing in recent years, accounting for more than 40% of UK students in 2023/24.\n\nDr Nicholas Weise Nick Weise says many commuter students don't realise that many others are in the same position as them\n\nNick Weise, who runs the university's commuter peer mentoring scheme, says about a quarter of the student population are commuters. The new lounge, which opened at the end of 2024, has been designed as a \"home away from home\", he says. \"Some of the feedback we got was that commuters would have to arrive maybe an hour early, in case there was traffic or delays. \"If their first lecture was at 09:00, they were arriving at 08:00, and they had nowhere to be. They were just wandering the streets. \"So now we have that commuter lounge open from 08:00 where they can come, just have a little rest, a little place to land and recharge, store their food.\" With some students taking multiple buses and trains to get to university every day, from as far as Morecambe or Derby, he says it's important commuters have a place they can be between lectures. For Amelka, it is \"one of the best things to happen\" at the university.\n\nAmelka Zambrzycka The commuter space has a study area and socialising spaces that students can use between lectures\n\n\"I live in there, that is my house,\" she says. \"[Without it] I would have nowhere to go, other than the library, but you can't really socialise in a library. \"In the lounge you can always just come in, strike up a conversation with a random person, and you always have something in common because they're a commuter. You can complain about bus strikes, train delays, weird disruptions. \"Everyone loves it, it's perfect.\"\n\nEvery day, come rain or shine, Amelka leaves her mum's house at about 07:00 to walk the 25-minute journey to the train station. It takes her another 25 minutes on the train to get to Manchester Oxford Road station, before a further half-hour walk to the other side of campus for her first lecture of the day. After her lectures, she often stays in the commuter lounge to socialise or study, normally leaving when the space closes at 18:00, arriving home at about 20:00. She says it's worth it and her mental health has been boosted by the regular sunlight and 15,000 steps she walks each day. But there are downsides. \"It's so much harder to socialise when you're a commuter,\" she says. \"Most students that I've met, their social life is going to clubs, going to bars, to pubs really late at night, coming to each other's halls. It's all nightlife. \"It's not safe for me to do that hour-and-a-half commute in the middle of the night.\"\n\nAmelka Zambrzycka Commuters often factor delays into their journey time to uni",
