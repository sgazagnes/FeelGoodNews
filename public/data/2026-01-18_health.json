      "title": "AI maps the hidden forces shaping cancer survival worldwide",
      "summary": "Researchers have turned artificial intelligence into a powerful new lens for understanding why cancer survival rates differ so dramatically around the world. By analyzing cancer data and health system information from 185 countries, the AI model highlights which factors, such as access to radiotherapy, universal health coverage, and economic strength, are most closely linked to better survival in each nation.",
      "content": "For the first time, scientists have applied machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), to identify the factors most closely linked to cancer survival in nearly every country across the globe.\n\nThe research, publishedin the leading cancer journal Annals of Oncology, goes beyond broad comparisons to show which specific policy changes or system improvements could have the greatest impact on cancer survival in each nation. The team has also created an online tool that allows users to select a country and see how factors such as national wealth, access to radiotherapy, and universal health coverage relate to cancer outcomes.\n\nTurning Global Data Into Practical Insights\n\nDr. Edward Christopher Dee, a resident physician in radiation oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center in New York, USA, and a co-leader of the study, highlighted why the work matters. \"Global cancer outcomes vary greatly, largely due to differences in national health systems. We wanted to create an actionable, data-driven framework that helps countries identify their most impactful policy levers to reduce cancer mortality and close equity gaps.\"\n\nHe noted that several factors consistently stood out. \"We found that access to radiotherapy, universal health coverage and economic strength were often important levers being associated with better national cancer outcomes. However, other key factors were relevant as well.\"\n\nAnalyzing Cancer and Health System Data From 185 Countries\n\nTo reach these conclusions, Dr. Dee and his colleagues used machine learning to examine cancer incidence and death data from the Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN 2022), covering 185 countries. They combined this information with health system data gathered from the World Health Organization, the World Bank, United Nations agencies, and the Directory of Radiotherapy Centres.\n\nThe dataset included health spending as a percentage of GDP, GDP per capita, the number of physicians, nurses, midwives, and surgical workers per 1000 people, levels of universal health coverage, access to pathology services, a human development index, the number of radiotherapy centers per 1000 people, a gender inequality index, and the share of healthcare costs paid directly by patients.\n\nBuilding the Machine Learning Model\n\nThe machine learning model was developed by Mr, Milit Patel, the study's first author. He is a researcher in biochemistry, statistics and data science, healthcare reform and innovation at the University of Texas at Austin, USA, and at MSK.\n\nMr, Patel explained the reasoning behind this approach. \"We chose to use machine learning models because they allow us to generate estimates - and related predictions - specific to each country. We are, of course, aware of the limitations of population level data but hope these findings can guide cancer system planning globally.\"\n\nMeasuring Cancer Care Effectiveness\n\nThe model calculates mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIR), which represent the share of cancer cases that result in death and serve as an indicator of how effective cancer care is in a given country. To show how individual factors influence these estimates, the researchers used a method that explains predictions by measuring each variable's contribution, known as SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations).\n\nAccording to Mr. Patel, the goal was to move from description to action. \"Beyond simply describing disparities, our approach provides actionable, data-driven roadmaps for policymakers, showing precisely which health system investments are associated with the greatest impact for each country. As the global cancer burden grows, these insights can help nations prioritize resources and close survival gaps in the most equitable and effective way possible. International organizations, healthcare providers, and advocates may also use the web-based tool to highlight areas for investment, especially in resource-limited settings.\"\n\nCountry Examples Show Different Priorities\n\nThe results reveal that the most influential factors vary widely by country. In Brazil, the model indicates that universal health coverage (UHC) has the strongest positive association with improved mortality-to-incidence ratios. Other factors, such as pathology services and the number of nurses and midwives per 1000 people, appear to play a smaller role at present. The researchers suggest this means Brazil could see the greatest gains by prioritizing UHC.\n\nIn Poland, the availability of radiotherapy services, GDP per capita, and the UHC index show the largest impact on cancer outcomes. This pattern suggests that recent efforts to expand health insurance and access to care have produced stronger improvements than general health spending, which appears to have a more limited effect.\n\nJapan, the USA, and the UK show a broader pattern, with nearly all health system factors linked to better cancer outcomes. In Japan, the density of radiotherapy centers stands out most strongly, while in the USA and the UK, GDP per capita has the greatest influence. These findings point to where policymakers in each country may achieve the biggest gains.\n\nChina presents a more mixed picture. Higher GDP per capita, broader UHC, and greater access to radiotherapy centers contribute most to improved cancer outcomes. By contrast, out-of-pocket spending, the size of the surgical workforce per 1000 people, and health spending as a percentage of GDP currently explain less of the variation in outcomes.\n\nThe researchers write about China: \"High direct costs for patients remain a critical barrier to optimal cancer outcomes, even amidst national improvements in health financing and access. These findings underscore that while China's rapid health system development is yielding important gains in cancer control, disparities in financial protection and coverage persist, warranting intensified policy focus on reducing out-of-pocket expenditures and further strengthening UHC implementation to maximize health system impact.\"\n\nHow to Read the Green and Red Bars\n\nMr, Patel also explained the meaning of the green and red bars shown in the country-specific graphs. \"The green bars represent factors that currently appear most strongly and positively associated with improved cancer outcomes in a given country. These are areas where continued or increased investment is most likely to result in meaningful impact.\"\n\nHe stressed that red bars should not be misunderstood. \"However, the red bars do not indicate that these areas are unimportant or should be neglected. Rather, they reflect domains that, according to the model and current data, are less likely to explain the largest differences in outcomes right now. This may be due to already strong performance in these aspects, limitations of the available data, or other context-specific factors.\"\n\nHe added an important caution. \"Importantly, seeing a 'red' bar should never be interpreted as a reason to stop efforts to strengthen that pillar of cancer care - improvement in those areas can still be valuable for a country's overall health system. Our results simply suggest that, if the goal is to maximize improvement in cancer outcomes as defined by the model, focusing first on the strongest positive (green) drivers may be the most impactful strategy.\"\n\nStrengths, Limits, and What Comes Next\n\nThe study's strengths include its coverage of nearly all countries, use of current global health data, country-specific policy guidance rather than simple global averages, and the use of more transparent AI models. The researchers also acknowledge key limitations. The analysis relies on national-level data rather than individual patient records, data quality varies widely, especially in many low-income countries, and national trends can hide disparities within countries. In addition, the study cannot prove that focusing on a specific factor will cause better cancer outcomes, only that such efforts are associated with improved results.\n\nEven with these limits, the findings offer a useful way to prioritize action. Dr. Dee concluded: \"As the global cancer burden grows, this model helps countries maximize impact with limited resources. It turns complex data into understandable, actionable advice for policymakers, making precision public health possible.\"",

      "title": "An endocrinologist tried a new weight loss approach and it worked",
      "summary": "A simple change in how primary care clinics approach weight management is delivering big public health wins. PATHWEIGH lets patients openly request help and gives doctors the tools to focus entire visits on weight care. In a massive real-world trial, the program halted population weight gain and increased access to obesity treatment. Now, health systems across the U.S. are lining up to adopt it.",
      "content": "For a long time, endocrinologist Leigh Perreault, MD, felt uneasy about how weight management was handled in routine medical care. Too often, patients were sent home with the same advice to eat better and exercise more, even when it clearly was not enough.\n\n\"There was a moment I put my face in my hands and thought, 'What am I doing?' I would write a lot of prescriptions for patients' diabetes, their blood pressure, their lipids and all these other conditions,\" says Perreault, a professor of endocrinology, metabolism and diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine who practices in Westminster alongside primary care physicians.\n\nShe realized that many of those medications addressed symptoms rather than the root problem. \"None of these people want to be on these medications and I thought if I could just help them with their weight, many of these health concerns would probably go away,\" she says.\n\nThat realization set the stage for a new approach that would soon reshape how weight care could work in primary care settings.\n\nA New System Called PATHWEIGH\n\nPerreault and her colleagues created PATHWEIGH, a structured process that helps patients and primary care teams focus directly on weight management. The program introduces dedicated clinic visits where providers can concentrate specifically on weight related care instead of squeezing it into a standard appointment.\n\nWith funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), PATHWEIGH was rolled out across UCHealth's 56 primary care clinics throughout Colorado to evaluate its impact. The pilot included 274,182 patients, making it one of the largest randomized trials ever conducted in this area.\n\nResults published by Perreault and her team in Nature Medicine showed that the program reduced population weight gain by 0.58 kg over 18 months and shifted the overall trend from steady gain to weight loss -- an outcome with major implications for public health.\n\nThe program also made patients more likely to receive help for weight issues. Participation increased the chances of receiving weight related care by 23%.\n\n\"With PATHWEIGH, we showed that we absolutely eliminated population weight gain across all of our primary care, which has never been done previously,\" Perreault says.\n\nAs a result, obesity specialists are now pointing to PATHWEIGH as a possible standard of care, and several health systems around the country are exploring how to adopt it.\n\nBuilding a Clear Path to Weight Care\n\nPerreault describes PATHWEIGH as a way to align patients and clinicians around a shared plan.\n\n\"If you think about weight loss medicine or surgery or a weight loss program, those are all vehicles to weight loss,\" she says. \"We built a highway that we could put all the vehicles on, so there's actually a process for people to receive weight related care if they wanted it.\"\n\nThe process began with something simple. Clinics posted signs letting patients know they could request an appointment focused entirely on weight management by asking at the front desk.\n\nThat request automatically activated a workflow in the electronic health record. Patients received a survey, and once completed, their responses flowed directly into the clinician's notes. This allowed visits to focus less on background information and more on practical next steps.\n\n\"It made the whole process really efficient, and then effectively turned our note template into a menu of anything that we might do,\" Perreault says. \"It really made it extremely time efficient and consolidated everything we might do for a patient into one interface.\"\n\nRemoving Barriers and Awkward Conversations\n\nData collected over 18 months showed that about one in four eligible patients received some form of weight related care at least once during the trial. Most of that care involved lifestyle counseling, but prescriptions for anti-obesity medications doubled during the intervention.\n\nUnlike many one-size-fits-all weight loss programs, PATHWEIGH allowed treatment to be customized to each patient. It also reduced the discomfort that often surrounds conversations about weight in medical settings.\n\n\"Most people who want or need weight related care never get it. Either they don't ask for it or the providers don't bring it up, and if they do, the patient usually gets told to go home and eat less and exercise more, and then nothing happens,\" Perreault says. \"The person gets frustrated and they learn to not ask for help anymore, because it's kind of embarrassing and it doesn't help. This was a safe space to say, 'Hey, if you would like medical assistance with your weight, we actually have a process for you to receive that now.'\"\n\nWhy Small Changes Matter at Scale\n\nExperts estimate that rising obesity rates are driven by an average population weight gain of about .5kg per year. Stopping that increase and turning it into even modest weight loss could make a meaningful difference in slowing the obesity epidemic.\n\n\"While it's not a significant difference on an individual patient level, it's a huge deal on a population and public health level,\" Perreault says.\n\nResearchers also found that patients who received clear weight related care through PATHWEIGH experienced greater weight loss. Even patients who did not receive direct interventions saw reduced weight gain compared with what would normally be expected.\n\nExpanding Beyond Colorado\n\nPerreault says the program's success has opened the door to wider adoption. Plans are underway to expand PATHWEIGH beyond Colorado. The Obesity Association, which is developing its first standards of care for obesity, is highlighting the program as a recommended care process.\n\nFive health systems across seven states are also considering PATHWEIGH as its creators work toward licensing the model.\n\n\"I'm really proud that PATHWEIGH was home-grown and built and tested here in Colorado,\" Perreault says. \"This is the blueprint that moves us forward.\"",

A comprehensive review found they can help control blood sugar, support heart and gut health, and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. Laboratory and human studies also suggest bamboo may promote beneficial gut bacteria and reduce toxic compounds in cooked foods. However, bamboo must be pre-boiled to avoid natural toxins.",
      "content": "The first-ever academic review focused on bamboo as a food has uncovered a wide range of possible health benefits. Researchers found evidence suggesting bamboo consumption may help regulate blood sugar, reduce inflammation, support digestive health, and provide antioxidant effects.\n\nBamboo is known as the fastest growing plant on the planet, with some species capable of growing up to 90cm in a single day. While China and India are the largest producers and bamboo shoots are already common in many Asian cuisines, the findings suggest bamboo could become an important food option for diets around the world.\n\nNutritional Profile of Bamboo Shoots\n\nBamboo shoots offer a strong nutritional profile. They are rich in protein, contain moderate amounts of fiber, and are naturally low in fat. Bamboo also provides essential amino acids, along with minerals such as selenium and potassium. In addition, it supplies several vitamins, including thiamine, niacin, vitamin A, vitamin B6, and vitamin E.\n\nThe review was carried out by researchers from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) in England. It is the first study to bring together and analyze all existing research on bamboo consumption, covering both human trials (in vivo studies) and laboratory experiments conducted on human cells (in vitro studies).\n\nPotential Benefits for Metabolic and Heart Health\n\nAccording to the review, bamboo shoots may play a role in improving metabolic health. Human trials reported better glycemic control, suggesting bamboo could help regulate blood sugar levels, which is especially important for managing diabetes. Researchers also observed improvements in lipid profiles, a change associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nDigestive Support and Gut Health Effects\n\nBamboo contains several types of dietary fiber, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These fibers have been shown to improve bowel function in human participants. Additional studies reported increased antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity after bamboo consumption, along with reduced cell toxicity and improved cell viability.\n\nLaboratory research further supported bamboo's nutritional value and antioxidant strength. These experiments also identified probiotic effects, indicating bamboo may help support gut health by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria.\n\nResearchers also found that compounds found in bamboo can inhibit the formation of furan and reduce the production of acrylamide. Both substances are toxic chemicals that can form when certain foods are fried or roasted. This suggests bamboo could potentially be used to make some cooked foods safer.\n\nPreparation Risks and Safety Concerns\n\nDespite its benefits, the review also highlighted important safety risks. Some bamboo species contain cyanogenic glycosides, which can release cyanide if the shoots are eaten raw or improperly prepared.\n\nOne study also found that bamboo shoots may contain compounds that interfere with thyroid hormone production. This interference can increase the risk of developing goiter, a condition linked to multiple health complications. Both of these risks can be avoided by properly pre-boiling bamboo shoots before consumption.\n\nWhat Researchers Say About Bamboo's Future\n\nSenior author Lee Smith, Professor of Public Health at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), said: \"Bamboo is already commonly eaten in parts of Asia and it has huge potential to be a healthy, sustainable addition to diets worldwide -- but it must be prepared correctly.\n\n\"The multiple health benefits we identified, including its potential to tackle modern health challenges like diabetes and heart disease, are likely due to the nutritional content of bamboo and its extracts, with bamboo rich in proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins.\n\n\"Our review shows bamboo's clear promise as a possible 'superfood', but there are also gaps in our knowledge. We could only find four studies involving human participants that met our criteria, so additional high-quality human trials are necessary before we can make firm recommendations.\"",

Credit: Christoph Burgstedt/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers have engineered a time capsule for cells, capable of collecting and storing mementos of past activity.\n\nThe cellular storage units, called TimeVaults, could help unlock secrets to cancer-drug resistance and stem-cell biology, and more broadly how past events shape a cell’s future. The findings were published today in Science1.\n\nTimeVaults are made from mysterious cell structures called vaults, which have been modified to collect and store the molecular products of gene transcription, known as messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules.\n\n“This is a major step towards a longstanding goal in the field: being able to continuously record transcription in human cells,” says Randall Platt, a biological engineer at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology in Zurich. “I anticipate that TimeVaults will allow us to observe facets of biology previously inaccessible to us.”\n\nCell recorders\n\nCells change constantly. Researchers tend to study their dynamics in two ways. One method is to watch them live under a microscope, where a limited number of types of molecules can be tracked for days with fluorescent tags. Another way is in test tubes at a single time point, usually the end of an experiment, where mRNA molecules can be measured and compared with those in other cells to reconstruct the past.\n\nOver the last decade, researchers have developed a bevy of ‘cell recorders’ — many using CRISPR gene editing — to create an indelible genetic ledger of transient events, such as the activity of a particular molecular pathway over time. This ledger can then be read by genome sequencing to identify the edits at a later point, creating a timeline of cellular events.\n\nBut these have a downside: researchers have to decide in advance which events they want to monitor, says Fei Chen, who studies single-cell and genome biology at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIn search of an unbiased way of recording of a cell’s lifetime, Chen and his colleagues found inspiration on YouTube. A student in his lab came across a profile of Leonard Rome, who goes under the name of Vault Guy. Rome is a cell biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and host of an educational YouTube channel about mysterious, barrel-shaped cellular organelles called vaults. In the 1980s, Rome co-discovered vaults, which are present in the thousands in most mammalian cells. Yet their function has remained unknown ever since.\n\nTo turn vaults into time capsules, Chen’s team reengineered a vault protein in such a way that it recognizes and links to a molecular hallmark of mRNA molecules, thereby capturing the mRNA inside the vault. The production of this protein — the equivalent of hitting the ‘record’ button — is triggered by treating cells with a drug and stopped by withdrawing the drug.\n\nWith these modifications, the TimeVaults captured a small fraction of all of the mRNA molecules produced by a human cell line over a 24-hour window, and stored them for at least a week, Chen’s team found. The researchers found no sign that cells with TimeVaults behaved differently because of their cargo, nor that the barrel-shaped structures changed shape or size once filled. “They are incredibly happy,” Chen says.\n\nPractical applications\n\nChen’s team is just beginning to play around with their invention. In the Science paper, Chen’s team used TimeVaults to understand — and overcome — pernicious cancer cells known as persisters. These cells lack genetic mutations that evade targeted cancer drugs, yet somehow survive drug treatment.",
