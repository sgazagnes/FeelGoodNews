      "content": "Life-extending prostate cancer drug to be offered to thousands in England\n\n11 hours ago Share Save Hugh Pym , Health editor and Ian Atkinson Share Save\n\nGiles Turner Giles Turner paid privately to access abiraterone and was part of the campaign to get it approved in England\n\nA life-extending prostate cancer drug is to be made available to thousands of men in England in a matter of weeks, after a campaign by a patient and a charity. Abiraterone has been provided on the NHS in Scotland and Wales since 2023 but not in England and Northern Ireland, except in the most severe cases. The drug is already prescribed for patients in the UK with very advanced prostate cancer that has spread. But from now on the drug will be available on the NHS in England to high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet metastasised - potentially saving hundreds of lives.\n\nAmy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at charity Prostate Cancer UK, said the decision was \"a momentous, life-saving victory for the thousands of men whose lives will now be saved\". She praised the BBC for keeping \"a spotlight on this issue\" through its coverage over the past few years. The charity estimates 7,000 men a year will now start the treatment, with some 1,470 avoiding later news that their cancer has got worse. The charity suggests some 560 lives will be saved. The drug will be available in weeks, NHS England says, with around 2,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the last three months getting access to the treatment if it is of clinical benefit. Abiraterone stops cancer spreading by starving the disease of the hormones it needs to grow.\n\nGiles Turner, from Brighton, was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in March 2023. He approached BBC News later that year after hearing that abiraterone was provided by the NHS in Scotland and Wales but not in England. \"I was shocked and angered that my postcode meant I was denied free access to a treatment that could halve my risk of dying and give me the best chance of a cure,\" he told the BBC. He chose to pay for treatment with the drug, costing him £250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not. Mr Turner began his campaign for a change of policy. At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men. But the following year officials told Prostate Cancer UK that there was no funding available. This was repeated by ministers in early 2025. \"Today's wonderful news is the culmination of all our determined and dogged efforts\" said Mr Turner. \"I'm beyond happy that men like me now have fair access to the most effective treatment, that so many lives will now be saved, and that so many families will be spared heartbreak.\" But he added that he was frustrated that nearly three years had passed since he raised the issue.\n\nInstitute of Cancer Research Abiraterone tablets can help stop prostate cancer spreading\n\nProstate Cancer UK's argument that many lives could be extended by the drug was based on the findings of a trial called STAMPEDE, published in 2022. It found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care. The Institute of Cancer Research said two years of abiraterone halved the risk of prostate cancer coming back and reduced the risk of death by 40%. Researchers had been frustrated that the health watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) had not approved the use of the drug for newly diagnosed patients. But for NICE and the medical regulator the MHRA to consider extending a drug's usage they need detailed and time-consuming applications. In October 2022, abiraterone had gone \"off patent\" - which means the legal protection granted to the original brand making it (granting them exclusive rights to manufacture and sell it) had expired. Once it became a generic medicine - with other companies now having the right to buy and sell it - there was limited incentive for companies to seek approval for it to be prescribed for a wider group of patients. Ministers and health authorities in Scotland and Wales found a way within existing protocols to start supplying the drug to the NHS. But there was no such shift in England. NHS England said because money had been saved on other medicines it was now possible to fund the extension of the drug's availability.",

      "content": "Paracetamol is safe in pregnancy, says study refuting Trump autism claims\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Philippa Roxby and Jim Reed Health reporters Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nTaking paracetamol while pregnant is safe and there's no evidence it raises the risk of autism, ADHD and developmental issues in children, say experts behind a major new review. Pregnant women \"should feel reassured\" by the findings, they say, which contradict controversial claims from US President Donald Trump last year that paracetamol \"is no good\" and pregnant women should \"fight like hell\" not to take it. His views were criticised at the time by medical organisations worldwide. Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety. But US health officials maintain that \"many experts\" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy.\n\nThe US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol or a branded version called Tylenol - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy. Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research. Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Women's Health, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't. The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review \"gold-standard\". The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link. \"When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism,\" lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC. \"The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" she added. This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller. Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says. \"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever,\" said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London. Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies.\n\nMedical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women. Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers \"do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health\". \"I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close,\" she said. Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was \"well-conducted\" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses. According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides \"strong evidence\" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and \"should effectively put this question to rest\". It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones.\n\nGetty Images In a speech in September 2025, President Trump said his administration was linking paracetamol (or acetaminophen) to autism and urging pregnant women to largely avoid the pain reliever",

      "title": "Fewer offspring, longer life: The hidden rule of mammal aging",
      "summary": "A large international study reveals that mammals tend to live longer when reproduction is suppressed. On average, lifespan increases by about 10 percent, though the reasons differ for males and females. Castrated males avoid the harmful effects of testosterone, while females gain longevity by sidestepping the intense physical demands of pregnancy and nursing. The results underscore a powerful biological trade-off between making offspring and staying alive longer.",

Different biology for males and females: Males live longer only when castration removes testosterone, while females gain longevity from any form of reproductive suppression, likely because avoiding pregnancy and lactation reduces heavy energy demands on the body.\n\nMales live longer only when castration removes testosterone, while females gain longevity from any form of reproductive suppression, likely because avoiding pregnancy and lactation reduces heavy energy demands on the body. Shifts in how animals die: Castrated males are less likely to die from aggression or risky behavior, while females with blocked reproduction experience fewer deaths from infections, suggesting stronger immune defenses.\n\nWhy Lifespans Differ Across Species\n\nAnimals across the natural world age at dramatically different rates. A female elephant can live as long as 80 years, yet she produces only a small number of calves over her lifetime. By contrast, a mouse may survive just a few years but is capable of producing dozens of offspring. Evolutionary biology explains this contrast through a basic principle: energy is limited, and species must divide it between reproduction and maintaining their bodies. A new large-scale study offers fresh evidence that this trade-off plays a major role in shaping how long mammals live, including humans.\n\nAn international team of researchers, including scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, investigated how limiting reproduction influences lifespan in mammals. The study analyzed records from 117 mammal species living in zoos and aquariums worldwide and combined them with a meta-analysis of 71 previously published studies. Together, the data showed that long-term hormonal contraception and permanent surgical sterilization are linked to an average lifespan increase of about ten percent.\n\nThe reproduction -- survival trade-off\n\nProducing offspring requires enormous biological investment. Pregnancy, nursing, sperm production, courtship behavior, and parental care all consume large amounts of energy. Even outside of active breeding, sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen continue to affect growth, behavior, and aging, drawing resources away from long-term body maintenance.\n\n\"Zoos, where reproduction is carefully managed, provide a unique setting to study these dynamics,\" says Johanna Stärk, one of the authors. \"Animals may receive contraception or sterilization to prevent breeding, creating natural comparison groups within the same environment.\"\n\nThe lifespan benefits of reduced reproduction appeared across a wide range of mammals, including primates, marsupials, and rodents. In some cases, the effects were striking. Female hamadryas baboons given hormonal contraception lived 29 percent longer, while castrated males lived 19 percent longer. \"This study shows that the energetic costs of reproduction have measurable and sometimes considerable consequences for survival across mammals,\" says Fernando Colchero, one of the study's senior authors. \"Reducing reproductive investment may allow more energy to be directed toward longevity.\"\n\nBoth sexes live longer -- but for different reasons\n\nWhile limiting reproduction extended lifespan in both males and females, the biological pathways involved were not the same. Lead author Mike Garratt of the University of Otago explains that only castration, not vasectomy, increased male lifespan. \"This indicates that the effect stems from eliminating testosterone and its influence on core aging pathways, particularly during early-life development. The largest benefits occur when castration happens early in life,\" he says.\n\nIn females, several forms of sterilization were associated with longer lives, suggesting that the benefit comes from avoiding the intense physical demands of pregnancy, nursing, and reproductive cycling. Removing the ovaries, which stops ovarian hormone production, also extended lifespan. However, a meta-analysis of 47 laboratory rodent studies revealed potential downsides, as later-life health outcomes may worsen. These results could help explain the \"survival-health paradox\" seen in post-menopausal women, who often live longer than men but experience higher levels of frailty and chronic illness.\n\nDifferent Causes of Death by Sex\n\nThe study also found notable differences in how males and females died. Castrated males were less likely to die from causes linked to aggression or risky behavior. Females whose reproduction was blocked were less likely to die from infections, supporting the idea that the high energy demands of reproduction may weaken immune defenses in mothers.\n\nDirect evidence from humans remains limited. Some historical records, including data from Korean Eunuchs in the pre-19th century Chosun Dynasty, suggest that castrated men lived about 18 percent longer than men who were not castrated. However, researchers caution that these records are debated and should be interpreted carefully.\n\nAmong women, surgical sterilization performed for non-cancerous reasons (such as hysterectomy or oophorectomy) is linked to a very small reduction in lifespan, roughly 1 percent compared with similar women who were not sterilized. \"Reproduction is inherently costly,\" the authors note. \"However, human environments -- through healthcare, nutrition and social support -- can buffer or reshape these costs.\"\n\nA Fundamental Evolutionary Trade-Off\n\nOverall, the findings highlight reproduction as a major biological expense for mammals. The balance between producing offspring and preserving the body represents a core evolutionary trade-off that influences aging and survival. These costs arise from a combination of hormonal effects and the physical risks and stresses tied to reproduction.\n\nMany details remain unresolved, and the researchers emphasize the need for further study. \"Our findings show that the costs of reproduction are substantial and measurable across a vast range of mammals,\" the authors conclude. \"Understanding these trade-offs deepens our insight into how aging evolves and how males and females balance survival and reproduction differently.\"",

      "title": "Scientists “resurrect” ancient cannabis enzymes with medical promise",
      "summary": "Scientists have uncovered how cannabis evolved the ability to make its most famous compounds—THC, CBD, and CBC—by recreating ancient enzymes that existed millions of years ago. These early enzymes were multitaskers, capable of producing several cannabinoids at once, before evolution fine-tuned them into today’s highly specialized forms. By “resurrecting” these long-lost enzymes in the lab, researchers showed how cannabis chemistry became more precise over time—and discovered something unexpected: the ancient versions are often more robust and easier to work with.",
      "content": "Where did cannabis compounds like THC, CBD, and CBC come from? Scientists at Wageningen University & Research have now provided the first experimental proof showing how cannabis developed the ability to make these well-known cannabinoids. Along the way, the team also created enzymes that could be useful for producing cannabinoids through biotechnology, especially for medical use.\n\nTheir findings were published in the scientific journal Plant Biotechnology Journal. To reach these conclusions, the researchers rebuilt enzymes that no longer exist today but were active millions of years ago in early ancestors of the cannabis plant. Enzymes are essential to cannabinoid production in cannabis, driving the chemical reactions that create these bioactive compounds with recognized medicinal potential.\n\nHow Cannabis Enzymes Evolved Over Time\n\nToday's cannabis plants rely on highly specialized enzymes to produce THC, CBD, and CBC. Each compound is made by its own dedicated enzyme. The new research shows that this precision is the result of evolution and was not always the case.\n\nEarly versions of these enzymes were far more flexible. A single ancestral enzyme could generate multiple cannabinoids at once. Over time, gene duplications occurred during cannabis evolution, allowing these enzymes to gradually become more specialized and efficient at producing individual compounds.\n\nRecreating Ancient Cannabis Chemistry\n\nTo uncover this history, the researchers used a method called ancestral sequence reconstruction. By analyzing DNA from modern plants, they were able to predict what ancient enzymes likely looked like millions of years ago. These recreated versions, known as ancestral enzymes, were then produced in the laboratory and tested directly.\n\nThe results offer the first experimental evidence that cannabinoid production, including compounds such as THC, began in a relatively recent ancestor of cannabis and became more refined as the plant evolved. This process helped shape the complex chemical profile seen in cannabis today.\n\nNew Insights With Biotech Potential\n\nBeyond revealing how cannabis chemistry evolved, the study highlights practical opportunities. The reconstructed ancient enzymes turned out to be easier to produce in micro-organisms, such as yeast cells, than modern cannabis enzymes. This matters because cannabinoids are increasingly manufactured using biotechnological methods rather than grown directly in plants.\n\n\"What once seemed evolutionarily 'unfinished' turns out to be highly useful,\" says WUR researcher Robin van Velzen, who led the study with colleague Cloé Villard. \"These ancestral enzymes are more robust and flexible than their descendants, which makes them very attractive starting points for new applications in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research.\"\n\nToward New Medicinal Cannabis Varieties\n\nOne recreated enzyme stood out because it produces CBC very specifically, a cannabinoid known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. \"At present, there is no cannabis plant with a naturally high CBC content. Introducing this enzyme into a cannabis plant could therefore lead to innovative medicinal varieties,\" Van Velzen explains.\n\nTogether, the findings show how studying ancient plant DNA can deepen our understanding of evolution while also opening the door to new ways of producing medically valuable cannabis compounds.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Cannabis plants produce important compounds like THC, CBD, and CBC, which have medical uses. Scientists wanted to understand how these compounds first appeared and how the plant’s ability to make them changed over millions of years.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Wageningen University & Research recreated ancient cannabis enzymes that existed millions of years ago. These enzymes were less specialized and could make several cannabinoids at once. Using DNA from modern plants, they predicted and built these old enzymes in the lab to study how cannabis chemistry evolved.\n\n**Impact** – This study shows that cannabis enzymes became more specialized over time through evolution. The ancient enzymes are stronger and easier to produce in lab-grown microbes like yeast, which could help make cannabinoids using biotechnology instead of farming plants. One ancient enzyme can produce CBC, a cannabinoid not common in today’s plants but known for reducing pain and inflammation.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists may use these ancient enzymes to create new cannabis varieties with higher amounts of helpful cannabinoids like CBC. They can also improve how cannabinoids are made in labs, making it easier to develop medicines.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – By recreating ancient cannabis enzymes, scientists uncovered how the plant evolved to make important medical compounds and found new ways to produce them for future treatments.",
