      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nLiving in one of the most expensive cities on Earth just got a little easier for families. In a major move to tackle affordability, San Francisco will now offer free childcare to families earning under $230,000 a year, and a 50 percent subsidy to those earning up to $310,000. That’s not a typo; six-figure earners are finally getting some relief.\n\nAnnounced by newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie as part of his “Family Opportunity Agenda,” the initiative aims to make staying in the city a realistic option for families who might otherwise be priced out.\n\n“Today marks the beginning of a powerful effort to reduce the cost of living for San Francisco families by tens of thousands of dollars each year,” Lurie said in a statement. “We’re committed to making San Francisco a place where families can stay, grow, and build their future.”\n\nChildcare costs are crushing, even for high earners\n\nIf you’ve ever Googled “cost of childcare in San Francisco” you already know: it’s brutal. The Children’s Council of San Francisco estimates childcare runs anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 per child per year.\n\nAnd that’s not just sticker shock; it’s a major financial burden. According to the Economic Policy Institute, infant care eats up more than 18 percent of a median family’s income in California. With two kids, that jumps to almost 30 percent, which is well above the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ affordability guideline of seven percent of household income.\n\nIn a city where even middle-class salaries struggle to stretch, these costs are part of what’s been pushing families out of the Bay Area. Lurie’s plan aims to flip that narrative.\n\nWho qualifies and how it’s funded\n\nInstead of using national federal poverty levels (which set the bar laughably low), San Francisco calculates eligibility based on area median income (AMI), a much more realistic metric for a high-cost city.\n\nHere’s how the new system works:\n\nFamilies of four earning under $230,000 (150 percent of AMI) get free childcare\n\nFamilies earning up to $310,000 (200 percent of AMI) qualify for a 50 percent subsidy\n\nBefore this, free care was only available to families making under 110 percent of AMI, leaving a large swath of working parents in a no-man’s land of unaffordable options.\n\nThe program will tap into over $550 million in unspent tax funds, collected after voters passed “Baby Prop C” in 2018. Legal challenges delayed the rollout, but now those funds will finally be put to work. Families will be able to access subsidized care from more than 500 childcare providers across the city.\n\nA growing national movement for universal childcare\n\nSan Francisco isn’t alone in tackling the childcare affordability crisis. Cities and states across the country are starting to treat childcare not as a luxury, but as a basic need.\n\nIn recent months:\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani launched free childcare for all two-year-olds\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul unveiled a plan for universal childcare across New York State by 2028\n\nNew Mexico became the first state to offer free childcare to all residents\n\nMayor Lurie’s move positions San Francisco as a leader in this growing trend, and as a city that’s serious about helping families not just survive, but thrive.\n\nA solution tailored for San Francisco families\n\n“This is a big step toward making San Francisco a place where families can thrive,” said Ingrid X. Mezquita, director of the city’s Department of Early Childhood. “Affordable, high-quality childcare is essential for families to stay in San Francisco, but the cost can make it really challenging.”\n\nFor families earning what would be considered upper-middle-class salaries in other parts of the country, San Francisco’s new plan offers long-awaited breathing room. It acknowledges that in high-cost cities, even six-figure households need support, especially when raising young children.\n\nAnd more than just easing individual stress, the program is part of a larger vision to rebuild the city’s middle class, reverse the family exodus, and invest in a more inclusive future.\n\nBecause in a city as vibrant and diverse as San Francisco, families shouldn’t have to choose between opportunity and affordability. They should have both.\n\nDid this solution stand out? Share it with a friend or support our mission by becoming an Emissary.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities in the United States. Childcare costs there can reach $20,000 to $30,000 a year per child, which makes it very hard for many families to afford living in the city.\n\n**What happened** – The city’s new mayor, Daniel Lurie, announced a plan called the “Family Opportunity Agenda.” Starting now, families of four earning less than $230,000 a year will get free childcare. Families earning up to $310,000 will receive a 50% discount. The program uses over $550 million in tax money collected from a 2018 voter-approved measure called Baby Prop C. This money supports more than 500 childcare providers across San Francisco.\n\n**Impact** – This program is important because it helps not just low-income families but also middle and upper-middle-class families who struggle with high childcare costs. Before, free childcare was only for families making much less, leaving many without help. Now, more families can afford to stay and raise children in the city. It also sets an example for other places to treat childcare as a basic need.\n\n**What's next step** – Families in San Francisco will soon be able to apply for the new childcare help. The city will continue working to improve access and quality of childcare. Other cities and states are watching and starting similar programs, so this could lead to more widespread support for families.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – San Francisco’s new childcare program offers free or discounted care to many families, easing costs and helping more children grow up in the city.",

Ce programme utilise plus de 550 millions de dollars provenant d’une taxe votée en 2018 appelée Baby Prop C. Cet argent soutient plus de 500 prestataires de garde d’enfants à San Francisco.\n\n**Impact** – Ce programme est important car il aide non seulement les familles à faible revenu, mais aussi celles de la classe moyenne et moyenne supérieure qui ont du mal à payer la garde d’enfants. Avant, la garde gratuite était réservée aux familles gagnant beaucoup moins, laissant beaucoup sans aide. Maintenant, plus de familles peuvent rester et élever leurs enfants en ville. Cela montre aussi l’exemple à d’autres endroits pour considérer la garde d’enfants comme un besoin essentiel.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – Les familles de San Francisco pourront bientôt demander cette aide pour la garde d’enfants.

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 29 January 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04162-6Despite attempts by many universities to modernize their policies on working conditions and misconduct, the academic system has pushed back. Here’s how to ensure lasting change.",
      "content": "Many doctoral students and early-career researchers do not feel empowered to report poor working conditions or supervisor misconduct.Credit: Getty\n\nWhen you spend enough years in academia, you begin to hear the same sentence spoken over and over:\n\n“It won’t make any difference.”\n\nWe have both heard it, too many times. It is what a doctoral student says when a supervisor crosses a line and they are encouraged to report misconduct. It is what a postdoc says when they are urged to complain after being asked to work unpaid overtime, under the shadow of a recommendation letter. And it is what a young academic tells themself when they experience humiliation or dismissal and cannot find a formal channel through which to discuss their situation.\n\nAcademic life has changed. But we feel that academic culture hasn’t kept up. One of us (F.G.S.) has spent eight years working with educators across Europe to promote mentorship training, safe learning environments and ethical leadership. The other (R.A.H.) has spent decades listening to doctoral students who feel voiceless. We represent two distinct nations and institutions, but we share a concern that something fundamental is broken in the culture of how people are taught, trained and treated in academic spaces.\n\nWe met through a small but growing group called the Academic Think Tank, an informal international network that brings together educators, researchers and academic leaders to discuss how to improve academic culture.\n\nWe think that improvement is possible, but only if we speak openly about the challenges that academics and students face.\n\nThe human costs of the research-assessment culture\n\nDespite attempts by many universities to improve workplace culture in higher education by introducing codes of conduct and leadership training, the system remains strongly hierarchical, rewarding research output over respectful behaviour. This, in our view, could drive future generations of researchers to choose industry over academia. People at the bottom of the hierarchy are often invisible to their institutions; at the top, a person’s publication record can act as a shield for bad behaviour. Those in charge of people’s work contracts, funding, authorship attribution and reference letters can easily forget how vulnerable other people’s positions can be.\n\nWe asked our Academic Think Tank colleagues (in North America, Europe and Asia) to reflect on what needs to improve the most. The same issues kept surfacing: supervisors who see students as labour, not as learners; early-career researchers who are afraid to report abuse or harassment; and institutions that tolerate workplace toxicity in exchange for prestige.\n\nHere are five things that we think must become standard practice in academia.\n\nMandatory leadership training\n\nSome professors are promoted for their research output, not for their ability to manage people. This has to change. Every leadership role should include mandatory training in supervision, leadership and communication, with regular refreshers and feedback mechanisms that embrace diverse perspectives, such as the 360-degree method.\n\nSome universities require academics to attend an introductory doctoral supervisor course before they can act as principal supervisors, and offer follow-up leadership courses for people managing research groups.\n\nAnonymous reporting systems that work\n\nReporting mechanisms must be followed up with real action to ensure that people can trust them. A reporting system that doesn’t work is one in which complaints disappear, nothing is documented, there is no feedback to the person who made the report and problematic behaviour patterns never reach leadership teams. Institutions should publish anonymized data to build transparency.\n\nAt the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, all graduating PhD students are invited to complete an anonymous survey, and the results are summarized in public reports that highlight the strengths and problem areas of the doctoral environment.\n\nCultural climate audits\n\nDepartments should be internally assessed regularly by the university on how inclusive, respectful and equitable they are — not just on financial and research metrics used to estimate productivity.",

Although universities have tried to improve these issues, the culture in academic workplaces has not changed enough.\n\n**What happened** – Two experts who have worked with educators and students worldwide shared five key ideas to improve academic workplaces. These include mandatory leadership training for professors, reliable anonymous reporting systems, and regular checks on how respectful and inclusive departments are. They highlight examples like the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, which collects anonymous feedback from PhD students and publishes the results.\n\n**Impact** – These changes focus on making universities safer and fairer for students and researchers. For example, leadership training helps supervisors treat students as learners rather than just workers. Effective reporting systems make it easier to stop bad behavior. Regular climate audits encourage departments to care about respect and inclusion, not just research results. These steps can help reduce fear and unfairness in academic settings.\n\n**What's next step** – Universities can start adopting these practices more widely.

      "content": "Poland supports Ukraine’s membership in the European Union and NATO and is one of its biggest advocates, said Ukraine’s foreign minister Andrij Sybiha in an interview for the Ukrainska Pravda portal. Ukraine’s membership in the European Union is in the interest of Poles, the minister assessed.\n\n“We have the support of the Polish authorities for Ukraine’s membership in the European Union and NATO. It is one of our biggest advocates,” said Sybiha in the interview published on Tuesday.\n\nWhen asked specifically about the opinion of Poland’s president Karol Nawrocki on this issue, he replied: “I have no grounds to claim” that he does not support such a position.\n\n“I also believe that Ukraine’s membership in the European Union is in the interest of Poles, and in Poland there is an awareness of this fact,” assessed the head of Ukrainian diplomacy in the interview published on Tuesday.\n\n“The entire philosophy of the European Union is based on compromises. The states that can now put forward their demands have also gone through this process and know that in the end their accession was beneficial both for them and for the old members of the European Union. That is why I am optimistic that it will be possible to find compromise solutions,” emphasized Sybiha.\n\nAccording to the minister, in Ukrainian society and among experts the opinion often appears that even without Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban there will always be another state that will try to block Ukraine’s accession to the European Union. Sybiha stressed that the risk exists, and some partners openly tell Kyiv about it.\n\n“Our negotiations will certainly not be easy. Some partners tell us this directly – they will be linked to their internal political processes,” he noted.\n\nSybiha emphasized that Ukraine has recently achieved significant progress with Poland on extremely sensitive historical issues.\n\nThe foreign minister said that Ukraine’s president Wołodymyr Zełenski supported the unrestricted conduct of exhumations of the remains of Polish victims of wars and conflicts on the territory of Ukraine. He added that in practice this decision is already being implemented and permits are being issued by both sides.\n\n“There cannot, should not and will not be any obstacles to exhumations. Because all victims deserve respect and remembrance,” he stressed.\n\nAnswering the question of whether historical issues may lose significance in relations with Warsaw, Sybiha explained that progress is already visible. In his view, a sincere dialogue and a readiness to listen to the needs of the other side remain of key importance.\n\nFor many years, Poland and Ukraine have been divided by the memory of the role of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which in 1943-1945 carried out a genocidal ethnic cleansing of nearly 100,000 Polish men, women and children. Since the spring of 2017, there had been a dispute over the ban on searches and exhumations of the remains of Polish victims of wars and conflicts on the territory of Ukraine, introduced by the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance. The ban was issued after the dismantling of a UPA monument in Hruszowice in April 2017.\n\nThe decision to lift it was announced at the end of November 2024 during a press conference by the foreign ministers of Poland and Ukraine, Radosław Sikorski and Andrij Sybiha.\n\nZełenski during a meeting with Nawrocki in Warsaw at the end of December declared his readiness to accelerate exhumations in Volhynia. The Polish president had earlier said that this is a key issue for him.\n\nOn Sunday, the president of Ukraine stated that his country would be fully technically ready in 2027 to become a member of the European Union.
