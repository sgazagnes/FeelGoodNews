      "content": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nFrom an early age, Elizabeth was known for her imagination, a young girl in Central Myanmar who loved losing herself in Chinese fantasy novels and stories of courage. Her aunt’s small book rental shop became her haven, where she spent countless hours dreaming up her own worlds and writing her own stories. In medical school, she started a blog site where she published love poems alongside creative “edutainment” pieces like why handwashing matters or the importance of wearing motorcycle helmets. Even then, her voice carried both compassion and conviction.\n\nHer motivation to become a doctor was uniquely her own, not driven by social pressure or parental expectation, but by a dream to one day sign her books as “Dr. Elizabeth, Medicine University.” At the time, many well-known Myanmar authors proudly included their university name after their pen name, and she wanted to do the same. After graduating in 2012 from the University of Medicine, she pursued a specialization in interventional cardiology.\n\nWhen Myanmar’s military seized power in 2021, she was among the first doctors to refuse to work under the junta. She went further speaking out publicly, live-streaming messages that encouraged other healthcare workers to resist oppression. Her courage came at a cost. She was charged under Section 505(a) of the Penal Code for “spreading false news” and “inciting unrest.” For a year, she hid in remote villages before eventually crossing into Mae Sot, Thailand, in 2022.\n\nDespite the hardship, exile became a new beginning. Through reflection, she realized how deeply patriarchy had shaped her country and her own sense of limitation. Feminism, she says, “opened her eyes” revealing the invisible systems that confine women and giving her the language to name the justice she had been fighting for all along.\n\nWhen she worked as a house resident, she often spoke up against workplace injustices calling out unfair treatment or naming those responsible. At the time, she didn’t know the term feminism, but she simply couldn’t stay silent. Laughing, she recalls, “Maybe it comes from all the Chinese novels I grew up reading, the heroines always found a way to fight back against injustice.”\n\nWhen asked what feminism means to her, she shared, “To me, being a feminist means kindness. If I stay silent when others suffer, one day it will be my turn to suffer too. So I choose to stand up not just for myself, but to prevent similar things from occurring for all of us.”\n\nIn exile, music found her again. What began as a personal outlet for healing soon turned into a movement. She started writing songs words born from pain, set to melodies that spoke of strength. One of her revolutionary songs became part of the “Blood Money Campaign,” a protest anthem that went viral across Myanmar’s resistance networks. Her other song got featured on NUG Radio, titled “Tattoo Revolution.”\n\nEarlier this year in Mae Sot, she joined a wellness session where she first connected with a community of exiled women supported by Exile Hub. Later, during a Feminist Residency, she discovered a sense of sisterhood and solidarity among others who had fled Myanmar’s repression. With the support of a Feminist Storytelling Grant, she is now creating The Phoenixes, a music video series that celebrates the strength and creativity of Myanmar’s women in exile.\n\nReflecting on her journey, she said, “Being part of this project gave me space to sing my own songs, make better music, and help my friends chase their dreams too.”\n\nToday, Elizabeth continues her healing journey through rhythm, resistance, and radical hope. Her story reminds us that even when silenced, a woman’s voice can still rise as song, as courage, and as light for others finding their way through the dark.",

      "title": "Australia's social media ban for children has left big tech scrambling",
      "summary": "The policy is the culmination of years of pressure on firms over online safety.",
      "content": "Australia's social media ban for children has left big tech scrambling\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Lily Jamali , North America Technology Correspondent, San Francisco and Tiffanie Turnbull , Sydney Share Save\n\nWatch: What do teenagers think about Australia's social media ban?\n\nWhen Stephen Scheeler became Facebook's Australia chief in the early 2010s, he was a true believer in the power of the internet, and social media, for public good. It would herald a new era of global connection and democratise learning. It would let users build their own public squares without the traditional gatekeepers. \"There was that heady optimism phase when I first joined and I think a lot of the world shared that,\" he told the BBC. But by the time he left the firm in 2017, seeds of doubt about its work had been planted, and they've since bloomed. \"There's lots of good things about these platforms, but there's just too much bad stuff,\" he surmises. That's no longer an uncommon view as scrutiny of the largest social media companies has increased around the globe. A lot of it has centred on teenagers, who have emerged as a lucrative market for incredibly wealthy global firms - at the expense of their mental health and wellbeing, according to critics. Various governments, from the state of Utah to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But the most radical step so far is set to unfold in Australia - a ban for under-16s that kicks in on 10 December has left tech companies scrambling. Many of the social media firms affected have spent a year loudly protesting against the new law, which requires them to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep underage users from having accounts on their platforms. They have claimed this ban actually risks making children less safe, argued it impinges on their rights, and repeatedly pointed to the questions around the tech that will be used to enforce the policy. \"Australia is engaged in blanket censorship that will make its youth less informed, less connected, and less equipped to navigate the spaces they will be expected to understand as adults,\" said Paul Taske from NetChoice, a trade group representing several big tech companies. The worry inside the industry is that Australia's ban - the first of its kind - may inspire other countries. \"It could become a proof of concept that gains traction around the world,\" says Nate Fast, a professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.\n\nWhistleblowers, lawsuits and questions\n\nGetty Images (L-R) Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing in January\n\nIn recent years, multiple whistleblowers and lawsuits have claimed that social media firms are prioritising profits over user safety. In January, a landmark trial will begin in the US hearing allegations that several – including Meta, TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube – have designed their apps to be addictive and knowingly covered up the harm their platforms cause. All deny this, but Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Snap boss Evan Spiegel have both been ordered to testify in person. The case consolidates hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, and is among the first to advance from a flood of similar lawsuits which allege social media contributes to poor mental health and child exploitation. In another ongoing case, state prosecutors alleged that Zuckerberg personally scuttled efforts to improve the wellbeing of teens on the company's platforms, including vetoing a proposal to ditch Instagram face-altering beauty filters which experts say fuel body dysmorphia and eating disorders. Former Meta employees Sarah Wynn-Williams, Frances Haugen and Arturo Béjar have given testimony before the US Congress alleging a range of wrongdoing they observed during their stints at the company. Meta maintains the company has worked diligently to create tools that keep teens safe online.\n\nBut the broader industry has also recently been taken to task over mis- and disinformation, hate speech and violent content. Graphic footage of the assassination of Charlie Kirk was rapidly spread on various platforms, even confronting people who were not seeking it out. Elon Musk has sued states in the US over laws that require social media firms, including X, to define and disclose how they fight hate speech online. And Meta was heavily criticised earlier this year after announcing it was getting rid of factcheckers who monitor its platforms for misinformation. A rare bipartisan front has emerged among American lawmakers eager to cut tech bosses down to size. During a hearing last year, Zuckerberg was prodded by one to apologise to bereaved families who had come to watch in person. Among those in the audience was Tammy Rodriguez, whose 11-year old daughter Selena took her life after facing sexual exploitation on Instagram and Snapchat. \"This is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nPublic scrutiny and private lobbying\n\nHowever, there's widespread criticism from many experts, lawmakers and parents - even kids - who feel social media companies are hiding from genuine action and accountability on these issues. As Australia's social media ban was considered, then formulated, the firms had little to say publicly. \"Hiding from the public discourse… it just breeds more suspicion and more distrust,\" Mr Scheeler says. Privately though, many were seeking to bend the government's ear. Spiegel personally sat down with Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells. She also claimed YouTube had sent globally renowned children's entertainers The Wiggles to lobby on their behalf. In carefully worded public statements, several of the firms have tried to push responsibility elsewhere. Meta and Snap both said operators of the major app stores – namely Apple and Google – should take on age verification duties. And many argued government is overstepping. Parents know best, they say, and they should decide what makes sense for their teens when it comes to social media use. Along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest. \"While we're committed to meeting our legal obligations, we've consistently raised concerns about this law… There's a better way: legislation that empowers parents to approve app downloads and verify age allows families - not the government - to decide which apps teens can access,\" a statement from Meta provided to the BBC said.\n\nWatch: Annika Wells says big tech won't intimidate her over Australian social media ban\n\nAsked why her government was unsympathetic to this reasoning - why anything short of a ban was unacceptable - Wells said the tech companies have had plenty of time to improve their practices. \"They have had 15, 20 years in this space to do that of their own volition now, and… it's not enough.\" Leaders in other countries feel the same, and have been knocking on her door for help, she says, rattling off the EU, Fiji, Greece, even Malta, as examples. Denmark and Norway have already begun work on similar laws, and Singapore and Brazil are watching closely too. \"We're pleased to be the first, we're proud to be the first, and we stand ready to help any other jurisdiction who seeks to do these things,\" Wells said.\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nAs the Australia ban loomed, the mounting pressure prompted the companies to introduce versions of their products marketed as safer for young users, said Pinar Yildirim, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Australia, after all, is a major market for social platforms. At parliamentary hearings in October Snapchat said it believed it had about 440,000 account users in the country aged between 13 and 15. TikTok said it had about 200,000 under-16 accounts and Meta said it had about 450,000 between Facebook and Instagram. Experts say they are also eager to ensure they don't lose others in even larger markets around the world.\n\nGetty Images Former Meta engineer Arturo Béjar speaks during a rally\n\nIn July, YouTube announced the rollout of AI technology that estimates a user's age in a bid to identify those younger than 18 and better shield them from harmful content. Snapchat has special accounts for children which it says put safety and privacy settings on by default for users between the ages of 13 and 17. And last year, Meta unveiled Instagram Teen accounts which similarly place users younger than 18 into more restricted privacy and content settings that Meta says are designed to limit unwanted contacts and exposure to explicit content. This development was accompanied by a massive marketing blitz in the US. \"If they create a more protected environment for these users, the thinking is, that may reduce some of the damage,\" Yildirim said. Yet critics aren't satisfied. Béjar, one of the Meta whistleblowers, led a study published in September that found almost two thirds of the new safety tools on Meta's Instagram Teen accounts were ineffective. \"The key issue here is that Meta and other social media companies aren't substantively addressing the harm we know teens are experiencing,\" Béjar told the BBC.\n\nGetty Images Critics say social media firms haven't done enough to protect children\n\nForced onto the defensive, the companies have attempted to convey that they are making a good faith effort to comply with Australia's impending ban despite their disagreement with it. But analysts say they'll be hoping the hurdles - which include legal challenges, technology loopholes for kids, and any unintended consequences of the ban - could bolster the case against such moves in other nations. And the companies \"have a fair bit of influence in how smoothly things go\", Professor Fast points out. \"[They] have an incentive to walk the very fine line about complying, but making sure that they don't comply so good that all the rest of the other countries go, 'Great, that works. Let's do the same',\" Mr Scheeler agrees.\n\nSupplied Former Facebook Australia chief Stephen Scheeler says social media companies have hidden from public discourse about the ban\n\nAnd the fines - a maximum of A$49.5m ($33m, £24.5m) for serious breaches - might just be seen as the cost of doing business, according to Carnegie Mellon University marketing professor Ari Lightman. \"[They're] a drop in the bucket,\" he says, especially for larger players eager to secure their next generation of potential users. Despite the concerns around the policy's implementation, Mr Scheeler says he feels like this is a \"seatbelt moment\" for social media. \"Some would argue that bad regulation is worse than no regulation, and sometimes that's true, but I think in this instance, even imperfect regulation is better than nothing, or better than what we had before,\" he says. \"Maybe it will work, maybe it won't work, but at least we're trying something.\"",

      "summary": "The Minister of Labour of the Slovak Republic Erik Tomáš announced that the social partners have approved the draft law in accordance with the EU regulation on equal pay for men and women.",
      "content": "The Minister of Labour of the Slovak Republic Erik Tomáš announced that the social partners have approved the draft law in accordance with the EU regulation on equal pay for men and women.\n\nBratislava – The tripartite unanimously approved the draft law on equal pay for men and women. This was stated on Monday after the meeting of the Economic and Social Council of the Slovak Republic by the Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic Erik Tomáš (Hlas-SD). According to him, the law on the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women for equal work or for work of equal value transposes into Slovak law the relevant regulation of the European Union.\n\n“The tripartite unanimously approved the new law on equal pay for men and women for equal work or work of equal value. This law passed through the tripartite without any comments from the social partners, so employers, trade unionists, and the Association of Towns and Municipalities of Slovakia absolutely agree with it,” explained the Minister of Labour.\n\nErik Tomáš emphasized that the employer will be obliged to introduce a remuneration structure, which means that the evaluation of work will be carried out on the basis of four clear criteria, namely complexity, responsibility, strenuousness, and working conditions. At the same time, other so-called soft skills will also be evaluated, namely social and communication abilities.\n\n“We submitted comments on the law, we are not satisfied, but it is the implementation of European legislation. There is a problem with the position and with the work performed. In the same position there can be and will continue to be differences, because in the same position workers do not necessarily perform the same work,” added the president of the Association of Employers’ Unions and Associations (AZZZ) SR Rastislav Machunka.\n\nAccording to him, AZZZ sees a problem in the related mandated administration, the submission of which to the authorities follows from the European directive.\n\nEquality in the remuneration of men and women, according to Martina Hoštáka, Secretary General of the National Union of Employers (RÚZ), is already regulated in the Slovak Republic, for example, by the Labour Code or the Anti-Discrimination Act. “From our point of view, the implementation of the relevant European directive should not be problematic. The problem is the reporting and administration associated with the law. This is burdensome for companies. On behalf of RÚZ, we have discussed all the comments we had with the Ministry of Labour,” Hošták underlined.\n\n“Even though in the Slovak Republic we already have in legislation today guaranteed equal pay for equal work for men and women, nevertheless there are several studies that say that this equality is still just a kind of dreamed-of, mythical chimera and is certainly not a reality. Therefore, we are in anticipation, we hope and believe that by implementing the European directive it will be possible to reduce the differences that are a reality today,” added František Gajdoš, Vice-President of the Confederation of Trade Unions (KOZ) SR.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Slovakia has existing laws aimed at equal pay for men and women, but studies show pay differences still exist. The European Union passed a regulation to strengthen this principle across member countries.\n\n**What happened** – On December 8, Slovakia’s tripartite group, which includes employers, trade unions, and local government representatives, unanimously approved a draft law to enforce equal pay for men and women. The law aligns with an EU regulation and requires employers to set pay based on clear criteria like job complexity, responsibility, and working conditions.\n\n**Impact** – This law is important because it creates a clearer, fairer system for paying workers, aiming to reduce the wage gap between men and women. It has broad support from key social partners, showing agreement across different groups. However, some worry about extra paperwork and challenges in applying the rules exactly, especially since workers in the same position might perform different tasks.\n\n**What’s next step** – The draft law will move forward in Slovakia’s legal process to become official. Employers will then need to adjust their pay systems and start reporting according to the new rules. This could lead to more fair pay practices and better monitoring of wage differences.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Slovakia’s new draft law, approved by employers and unions, follows EU rules to make pay fairer between men and women by using clear job criteria and stronger oversight.",
