      "title": "Massive hidden structures deep inside Earth may explain how life began",
      "summary": "Scientists may finally be closing in on the origins of two colossal, mysterious structures buried nearly 1,800 miles inside Earth—hidden formations that have puzzled researchers for decades. New modeling suggests that slow leakage of elements from Earth’s core into the mantle prevented the planet from developing strong chemical layers after its primordial magma-ocean era.",
      "content": "For many years, researchers have puzzled over two enormous and unusual features hidden deep inside Earth. Their size, shape and behavior are so extreme that traditional ideas about how the planet formed and evolved have struggled to explain them.\n\nA recent study in Nature Geoscience, led by Rutgers geodynamicist Yoshinori Miyazaki with a team of collaborators, presents a new interpretation that may finally clarify the origins of these structures and how they relate to Earth's long-term habitability.\n\nThese features, called large low-shear-velocity provinces and ultra-low-velocity zones, rest at the boundary between the mantle and the core nearly 1,800 miles below the surface. Large low-shear-velocity provinces are enormous masses of extremely hot, dense rock, with one positioned beneath Africa and the other under the Pacific Ocean. Ultra-low-velocity zones resemble thin, partly molten layers that cling to the core in puddle-like patches. Both strongly slow seismic waves, suggesting they contain materials or conditions unlike the surrounding mantle.\n\n\"These are not random oddities,\" said Miyazaki, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences in the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences. \"They are fingerprints of Earth's earliest history. If we can understand why they exist, we can understand how our planet formed and why it became habitable.\"\n\nClues From Earth's Magma Ocean Past\n\nAccording to Miyazaki, Earth was once encased in a global ocean of molten rock. As this ancient magma ocean cooled, many scientists expected the mantle to have developed distinct chemical layers, similar to how frozen juice separates into sugary concentrate and watery ice. However, seismic observations reveal no such clear layering. Instead, large low-shear-velocity provinces and ultra-low velocity zones appear to form complex, uneven piles at the bottom of the mantle.\n\n\"That contradiction was the starting point,\" Miyazaki said. \"If we start from the magma ocean and do the calculations, we don't get what we see in Earth's mantle today. Something was missing.\"\n\nLeaking Core Materials and a Long-Lost Magma Layer\n\nThe research team suggested that the missing factor is the core itself. Their model indicates that over billions of years, elements such as silicon and magnesium gradually escaped from the core into the mantle. This mixing would have disrupted the formation of strong chemical layers. It may also account for the unusual composition of the large low-shear-velocity provinces and ultra-low-velocity zones, which the scientists interpret as the cooled remains of a \"basal magma ocean\" altered by core-derived material.\n\n\"What we proposed was that it might be coming from material leaking out from the core,\" Miyazaki said. \"If you add the core component, it could explain what we see right now.\"\n\nHow Deep-Earth Processes Shape Planetary Habitability\n\nMiyazaki noted that the implications stretch beyond mineral chemistry. Interactions between the mantle and core may have influenced how Earth released heat, how volcanic activity developed and even how the atmosphere changed over time. This perspective may help clarify why Earth ended up with oceans and life, while Venus became extremely hot and Mars turned cold and barren.\n\n\"Earth has water, life and a relatively stable atmosphere,\" Miyazaki said. \"Venus' atmosphere is 100 times thicker than Earth's and is mostly carbon dioxide, and Mars has a very thin atmosphere. We don't fully understand why that is. But what happens inside a planet, that is, how it cools, how its layers evolve, could be a big part of the answer.\"\n\nA New Framework for Understanding Earth's Interior\n\nBy bringing together seismic observations, mineral physics and geodynamic simulations, the team reframed large low-shear-velocity provinces and ultra-low-velocity zones as essential records of how Earth formed. The study also suggests that these deep features may help fuel volcanic hotspots such as Hawaii and Iceland, creating a direct link between Earth's interior and the surface.\n\n\"This work is a great example of how combining planetary science, geodynamics and mineral physics can help us solve some of Earth's oldest mysteries,\" said Jie Deng of Princeton University, a co-author of the study. \"The idea that the deep mantle could still carry the chemical memory of early core-mantle interactions opens up new ways to understand Earth's unique evolution.\"\n\nThe researchers noted that each new insight brings them closer to reconstructing the planet's earliest chapters. Bits of evidence that once seemed isolated now appear to fit together in a more coherent story.\n\n\"Even with very few clues, we're starting to build a story that makes sense,\" Miyazaki said. \"This study gives us a little more certainty about how Earth evolved, and why it's so special.\"",

The number of countries involved now totals 59.\n\n“NASA welcomes the newest signatories, whose participation strengthens the global commitment to responsible exploration,” said acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. “Their decision to sign the Artemis Accords affirms a shared commitment to safe, transparent, and peaceful exploration — at a time when others seek to weaponize the final frontier. Together we are building the foundation for the Golden Age of space exploration.”\n\nBoth Malaysia and the Philippines signed the Artemis Accords as part of President Trump’s visit to Kuala Lumpur for the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit. The separate signings were announced by the White House on Oct. 26.\n\nForeign Minister Péter Szijjártó of Hungary signed the Artemis Accords on Oct. 22 while in Washington during an official visit, in the lead up to President Trump’s meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.\n\nHungary’s signing came three months after Hungarian to Orbit (HUNOR) astronaut Tibor Kapu launched to space in a mission aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station. The private astronauts, part of the NASA-supported Axiom Mission 4 crew, spent about two weeks conducting science, outreach, and commercial activities, alongside NASA astronauts.\n\nFive years of progress\n\nOn Oct. 13, 2020, during the first Trump Administration, the United States, led by NASA and the U.S. Department of State, joined with seven other founding nations to establish the Artemis Accords, responding to the growing interest in lunar activities by both governments and private companies.\n\nSince then, the Artemis Accords have grown into an international coalition. What began with a handful of founding nations has multiplied with seven countries signing in 2025 alone. The surge in participation highlights an increased global commitment to shaping a safe, peaceful, and prosperous future in space.\n\nIn September, NASA co-chaired the Artemis Accords Principals’ Meeting in Sydney alongside the space agencies of Australia and the United Arab Emirates. The gathering brought together dozens of signatory nations to deepen dialogue and strengthen shared commitments to the sustainable and responsible use of space. Global space leaders discussed the following topics:\n\nNon-interference in each other’s space activities, including transparency on expected launch dates, general nature of activities, and landing location\n\nOrbital debris mitigation\n\nInteroperability of systems for safer and more efficient operations\n\nRelease of scientific data\n\nAt the meeting, NASA committed to hosting an Artemis Accords workshop in 2026 for signatories focused on transparency and the sharing of data. The agency has taken additional steps since the accords were established to release more information about lunar missions, promoting openness and preventing harmful interference.\n\nThe progress made by signatories, and their continued commitment to implementing the accords’ principles, is essential to advancing sustainable exploration of the Moon under the Artemis campaign, Mars, and beyond. Following a call to Artemis Accords signatories, four CubeSats from South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Germany, will fly on Artemis II.\n\nMore nations are expected to sign the accords in the months and years ahead, as NASA and its partners continue to advance the principles of the accords.\n\nLearn more about the Artemis Accords at:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/artemis-accords",

Photo Credit: NASA Earth to Sky\n\nA collaboration between the NASA Earth Science Education Collaborative (NESEC) and Earth to Sky (ETS) – an exciting, growing partnership between NASA, the National Park Service, and other federal, state, and local organizations – is facilitating the implementation of a simple, yet incredibly effective activity that will help millions of national park visitors connect with NASA Earth and space science.\n\nThe Color-a-Pixel activity, developed by NESEC, transforms complex satellite imagery into accessible, collaborative art projects. Incorporating this simple technique into ETS science communication training programs demonstrates to park interpreters and outdoor educators how NASA's view from space can enhance millions of visitor experiences at parks, refuges, and nature centers.\n\n“This low-tech activity is powerful because of its simplicity,” explains ETS Space Science Coordinator Brandi Stewart, “All you have to do is pick up a crayon, follow the easy number guides, and discover the stories that NASA satellites are telling us about our world and beyond.”\n\nThe Color-a-Pixel activity begins with selecting satellite imagery from NASA missions like Landsat, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), or the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). Using technology developed by NESEC’s lead organization, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, these images are converted into a 3’ by 2’ poster of numbered squares, each corresponding to one of 120 standard Crayola crayon colors.\n\nEarth to Sky demonstrates the magnetic appeal of this activity by setting it up for the rangers and educators during workshops. With a bit of explanation, participants immediately jump in, eager to reveal the imagery and data shown through the pixels.\n\n“It becomes a group mission that, by the end of the training, the image will be fully colored in and complete. It’s been a great teambuilding and stress-relieving activity for our participants,” states Geneviève de Messières, Earth to Sky Program Lead.\n\nWhen applied to public lands communication efforts, this activity becomes a tool for interpretive messaging. While visitors work on completing the image, park rangers can weave in scientific concepts, environmental change stories, and space exploration connections. This activity also drives home that satellite imagery is more than just a pretty picture – each pixel is also data that scientists use to better understand Earth and other worlds throughout our solar system.\n\nBringing Space Down to Earth\n\nSome ways that Earth to Sky has implemented the activity at special events on public lands include:\n\nDeath Valley Dark Sky Festival, California: Visitors were invited to color Landsat imagery of Earth’s Badwater Basin and MRO imagery of Mars’ Belva Crater. As they colored, Earth to Sky outreach specialists made connections between finding signs of water on the dry landscapes in both locations.\n\nPark After Dark, Minnesota: During this urban event hosted by Mississippi River & National Recreation Area in Minneapolis St. Paul, attendees worked together to color topographical maps of both the Moon's familiar near side and its mysterious far side, using data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The striking differences that emerged through their coloring sparked questions about why the Moon's two hemispheres appear so dramatically different, leading to rich discussions about lunar formation and geological change.\n\nPatuxent Wildlife Refuge Open House, Maryland: Just miles from the urban centers of Baltimore and Washington DC, the Color-a-Pixel activity helped local community members visualize something they could feel but not easily see: the refuge's role as a \"cool island\" in an urban heat landscape. Visitors colored Landsat imagery of the refuge and surrounding neighborhoods while examining heat maps showing temperature differences between developed areas and the protected green space. The activity helped residents understand the refuge's importance beyond wildlife habitat.\n\nAll of these activities are available on the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) website in a pre-generated format ready for printing.\n\nA Colorful Collaboration\n\nThe collaboration between NESEC and Earth to Sky brings complex scientific concepts to diverse audiences in engaging and relevant ways. Earth to Sky's community of practice –now including more than 2,000 interpreters and environmental educators – reaches millions of visitors annually across the country's parks, refuges, and nature centers.\n\nTheresa Schwerin, who leads NESEC, noted that Color-a-Pixel originally started as a simple idea for a tabletop activity to use at conferences and public events. “I wanted something hands-on that could draw people in and start conversations as simple as ‘these beautiful NASA images from space are data’ and talk about different NASA missions and how they are relevant to people’s lives. There’s also an opportunity to invite the public to contribute to NASA science by participating in citizen science projects … [some of which] can fill in the details of the pixels with information that complements NASA’s view from space.”\n\nAndrew Clark, a data scientist and engineer at IGES, created the Color-a-Pixel poster generator, which has gone through several iterations to make it more effective. Schwerin noted, “I’ve used this at several public events. Kids will jump right in, with parents watching over their shoulders. Soon enough, the entire family is coloring together and asking questions about the image and NASA. I am thrilled about our collaboration with Earth to Sky that is taking this even further.”\n\nAs environmental challenges increasingly affect public lands, this collaboration helps visitors understand these issues through NASA's unique perspective from above. The activity also introduces learners of all ages to the broader value of NASA's Earth science missions alongside its more well-known space exploration endeavors.\n\nContinuing to Color Outside the Lines\n\nLooking ahead, the Earth to Sky partnership plans to continue using this activity in each new place they host a training. Most recently, Earth to Sky shared the activity with 417 visitors to the Goddard Space Flight Center Visitor Center, where local families colored in topographical Moon maps to prepare for International Observe the Moon Night. Additionally, a recording of a recent Color-a-Pixel webinar with NESEC’s Theresa Schwerin is available on the Earth to Sky website for interpreters and informal educators interested in implementing this place-based activity. Free registration is required to access this (and dozens of other) webinar recordings.\n\nThe success of this collaboration demonstrates how seemingly simple activities – enhanced with NASA science – can create meaningful learning experiences that resonate with visitors long after they leave a park or refuge.\n\nFor interpreters, educators, or NASA enthusiasts interested in bringing the Color-a-Pixel activity to their own sites or events, pre-generated activities are available in the gallery at: https://strategies.org/color-a-pixel-pregenerated.\n\nNASA science is helping humanity discover new perspectives on both our home planet and the universe beyond, one crayon at a time.

      "content": "Astronauts strapped moss spores to the outside of the International Space Station for nine months - and most of them survived the challenging experience\n\nThis moss grew from a spore exposed to space for nine months Tomomichi Fujita\n\nOn 4 March 2022, astronauts locked 20,000 moss spores outside the International Space Station and left them exposed to the rigours of space for 283 days. They then rescued the spores and returned them to Earth on a SpaceX capsule so that scientists could attempt to germinate them. Surprisingly, these attempts were successful.\n\nMosses were among the earliest land plants and are well known for colonising some of the harshest environments on Earth – Antarctica, volcanic fields and deserts, says Tomomichi Fujita at Hokkaido University in Japan, who was on the team that ran the experiment.\n\n“We wondered whether their spores might also survive exposure to outer space – one of the most extreme environments imaginable,” he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNumerous studies have already simulated whether various mosses and other plants can survive conditions beyond Earth, including what might be expected on Mars. But this is the first time researchers have tested whether a species of moss can cope with real space conditions. The spores came from the species Physcomitrium patens.\n\nA control group of spores that had stayed on Earth had a germination rate of 97 per cent, as did another set of spores that were exposed to space but shielded from the damaging ultraviolet radiation found there.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nMost astonishingly, over 80 per cent of the spores that were exposed to the full brunt of space – a vacuum, extreme temperatures, microgravity, UV and cosmic radiation – remained viable and germinated into normal plants. The team predicted it is possible that, based on the results of these experiments, some of the spores could remain viable in space for 15 years.\n\n“Opening the samples felt like unlocking a biological time capsule: life that had endured the void of space and returned fully functional,” says Fujita.\n\nPrior to the deployment, researchers had already tested other living parts of the moss, such as its filaments, in simulated conditions. They found that other life stages of the moss succumbed to UV radiation, freezing and heating, high salinity and dehydration within days to weeks.\n\nBut the spores seemed to be able to cope with all of these challenges. This is especially impressive for the spores that were locked outside the space station, since they were hit with everything at once while the Earth-based tests each involved testing just one stressor at a time.\n\nFujita says the multiple layers of spore walls that encase the reproductive tissue appear to offer “passive shielding against space stresses”.\n\nHe says it is as if the spores are inside their own spacecraft. This might have been an adaptive feature they developed to cope with the harsh environmental conditions that existed on land when life first moved out of the oceans hundreds of millions of years ago.\n\n“Spores are essentially compact life capsules – dormant but ready to reactivate when conditions become favourable,” he says. “It’s as though evolution equipped them with their own tiny survival pods, built for dispersal across both space and time.”\n\nFujita says that while the research doesn’t in any way prove that extraterrestrial life exists, it strengthens the case that life, once it has emerged, can be incredibly robust. “The fact that terrestrial life forms can endure space-like conditions suggests that life’s building blocks may be more widespread and persistent than we often assume.”\n\nDavid Eldridge at the University of New South Wales in Sydney says the true test isn’t whether the spores will germinate once back on Earth, but whether they can also germinate in space.\n\n“The trick will be to check the growth rates of these taxa in space and see whether they can reproduce,” he says.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists wanted to see if moss spores could survive the harsh conditions of outer space. Mosses are some of the oldest land plants and can live in tough places on Earth like deserts and Antarctica.\n\n**What happened** – On March 4, 2022, astronauts attached 20,000 moss spores to the outside of the International Space Station (ISS). These spores stayed in space for 283 days, facing extreme cold, heat, radiation, and no air. After nine months, the spores were brought back to Earth inside a SpaceX capsule. Scientists then tried to grow plants from these spores.\n\n**Impact** – More than 80% of the spores that were fully exposed to space conditions grew into healthy moss plants. This shows that moss spores are very tough and can survive in an environment that is much harsher than Earth. Researchers think some spores might even survive in space for up to 15 years. This is the first time anyone has tested moss spores in real space conditions, not just in a lab.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists want to find out if moss spores can also grow and reproduce while still in space, not just after returning to Earth. This will help us understand if plants can live and grow on other planets or in space habitats in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Moss spores exposed to space for nine months survived and grew on Earth, showing life can endure extreme environments beyond our planet.",
