      "summary": "A newly detected super-Earth just 20 light-years away is giving scientists one of the most promising chances yet to search for life beyond our solar system. The discovery of the exoplanet orbiting in the habitable zone of its star was made possible by advanced spectrographs designed at Penn State and by decades of observations from telescopes around the world.",
      "content": "A possible \"super-Earth\" located less than 20 light-years from Earth is giving researchers renewed optimism in the search for planets that might host life. The newly identified world, GJ 251 c, earned its \"super-Earth\" label because current data indicate it is almost four times the mass of Earth and is likely a rocky planet.\n\n\"We look for these types of planets because they are our best chance at finding life elsewhere,\" said Suvrath Mahadevan, the Verne M. Willaman Professor of Astronomy at Penn State and co-author of a recent paper in The Astronomical Journal. \"The exoplanet is in the habitable or the 'Goldilocks Zone,' the right distance from its star that liquid water could exist on its surface, if it has the right atmosphere.\"\n\nTwo Decades of Observations Lead to Breakthrough\n\nFor many years, astronomers searching for planets capable of hosting liquid water have developed ever more advanced telescopes and modeling tools to detect extremely faint variations in starlight. According to Mahadevan, this new result arose from more than 20 years of observations and represents one of the strongest opportunities yet to investigate a potentially habitable world.\n\nThe exoplanet was identified using data from the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF), a high-precision near-infrared spectrograph that functions as a sophisticated prism to separate starlight into its components. The HPF is installed on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at the McDonald Observatory in Texas, and Penn State researchers led its design and construction to support the search for Earth-like planets orbiting nearby stars.\n\n\"We call it the Habitable Zone Planet Finder, because we are looking for worlds that are at the right distance from their star that liquid water could exist on their surface. This has been the central goal of that survey,\" Mahadevan said. \"This discovery represents one of the best candidates in the search for atmospheric signature of life elsewhere in the next five to ten years.\"\n\nDetecting a Subtle Stellar Wobble\n\nMahadevan and his team studied a large set of measurements collected worldwide over two decades. Their analysis focused on the small but measurable \"wobble\" of the host star, GJ 251, caused by gravitational pulls from orbiting planets. These motions appear as slight Doppler shifts in the star's light.\n\nThey first refined measurements of a previously known inner planet, GJ 251 b, which completes an orbit every 14 days. By combining the long-term observations with new high-precision HPF data, the researchers detected a stronger signal repeating every 54 days, pointing to the presence of a more massive second planet. Additional confirmation came from the NEID spectrometer, another instrument built by Penn State researchers and operating at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.\n\n\"We are at the cutting edge of technology and analysis methods with this system,\" said Corey Beard, corresponding author of the paper, who carried out the research while earning his doctorate in astrophysics at the University of California, Irvine. \"We need the next generation of telescopes to directly image this candidate, but what we also need is community investment.\"\n\nOvercoming Stellar Activity to Reveal Planetary Signals\n\nOne of the major difficulties in exoplanet detection is separating a planet's signal from the star's own magnetic activity, which Mahadevan compared to a form of stellar weather. Starspots and other surface features can mimic the periodic variations produced by orbiting planets, creating the illusion of a planetary presence. To distinguish between the two, the team used advanced modeling techniques that examine how signals behave across different colors of light.\n\n\"This is a hard game in terms of trying to beat down stellar activity as well as measuring its subtle signals, teasing out slight signals from what is essentially this frothing, magnetospheric cauldron of a star surface,\" Mahadevan said.\n\nHe noted that detecting planets like GJ 251 c depends not only on sophisticated equipment but also on complex analysis and international teamwork. Such projects require long-term funding and coordination because meaningful discoveries can take decades to emerge.\n\nCollaboration and Advanced Tools Enable Discovery\n\n\"This discovery is a great example of the power of multi-disciplinary research at Penn State,\" said Eric Ford, distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of research for Penn State's Institute of Computational & Data Sciences (ICDS). \"Mitigating stellar activity noise required not just cutting-edge instrumentation and telescope access, but also customizing the data science methods for the specific needs of this star and combination of instruments. The combination of exquisite data and state-of-the art statistical methods enabled our interdisciplinary team to transform data into an exciting discovery that paves the way for future observatories to search for evidence of life beyond our solar system.\"\n\nAlthough current technology cannot produce direct images of GJ 251 c, Mahadevan said that upcoming telescopes will be capable of examining the planet's atmosphere, potentially revealing chemical traces of life.\n\nPreparing for Next-Generation Telescopes\n\n\"We are always focused on the future,\" he said. \"Whether that's making sure the next generation of students can engage in cutting-edge research or designing and building new technology to detect potentially habitable planets.\"\n\nGJ 251 c is situated in a position that future advanced telescopes will be able to study directly. Mahadevan and his students are already preparing for the era of 30-meter-class ground based telescopes, which will carry instruments capable of imaging rocky planets within their stars' habitable zones.\n\n\"While we can't yet confirm the presence of an atmosphere or life on GJ 251 c, the planet represents a promising target for future exploration,\" Mahadevan said. \"We made an exciting discovery, but there's still much more to learn about this planet.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation, NASA and the Heising-Simons Foundation supported the Penn State aspects of this research.",

      "title": "Jupiter’s wild youth may have reshaped the entire Solar System",
      "summary": "Simulations reveal that Jupiter’s rapid growth disrupted the early solar system, creating rings where new planetesimals formed much later than expected. These late-forming bodies match the ages and chemistry of chondrite meteorites found on Earth. The findings also help explain why Earth and the other rocky planets remained near 1 AU rather than plunging inward.",
      "content": "New research from Rice University indicates that Jupiter dramatically reshaped the early solar system. According to the study, the giant planet created rings and wide gaps in the protoplanetary disk, helping to solve a long-standing mystery: why many primitive meteorites formed several million years after the very first solid materials. The work draws on hydrodynamic models of Jupiter's growth combined with simulations that track how dust and young planets evolve. The findings appear in Science Advances.\n\nUsing advanced computer simulations, planetary scientists André Izidoro and Baibhav Srivastava found that Jupiter's rapid early expansion disturbed the disk of gas and dust surrounding the young sun. The planet's strong gravitational pull generated ripples throughout the disk, creating what they describe as \"cosmic traffic jams\" that kept small particles from falling into the sun. Instead, these particles accumulated in dense bands, allowing them to merge into planetesimals, the solid precursors of planets.\n\nSecond-Generation Planetesimals and the Origin of Chondrites\n\nA key finding from the study is that the planetesimals forming within these bands were not the solar system's original building blocks. They were part of a later generation and formed at a time that matches the birth of many chondrites, a class of stony meteorites that contain both chemical and chronological clues from the solar system's earliest era.\n\n\"Chondrites are like time capsules from the dawn of the solar system,\" said Izidoro, assistant professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Rice. \"They have fallen to Earth over billions of years, where scientists collect and study them to unlock clues about our cosmic origins. The mystery has always been: Why did some of these meteorites form so late, 2 to 3 million years after the first solids? Our results show that Jupiter itself created the conditions for their delayed birth.\"\n\nChondrites are especially important because they preserve some of the most untouched material available for scientific study. Meteorites from the first generation of planet-building objects melted and transformed, losing much of their original structure. In contrast, chondrites retain primitive solar system dust as well as small molten droplets called chondrules. Their unexpectedly late formation has challenged researchers for decades.\n\n\"Our model ties together two things that didn't seem to fit before -- the isotopic fingerprints in meteorites, which come in two flavors, and the dynamics of planet formation,\" Srivastava explained. \"Jupiter grew early, opened a gap in the gas disk, and that process protected the separation between inner and outer solar system material, preserving their distinct isotopic signatures. It also created new regions where planetesimals could form much later.\"\n\nHow Jupiter Helped Shape the Inner Solar System\n\nThe research also sheds light on another puzzle: why Earth, Venus and Mars orbit near 1 astronomical unit from the sun instead of spiraling inward, a common outcome in many planetary systems observed around other stars. By blocking the inward flow of gas, Jupiter prevented young planets from migrating toward the sun. As a result, these worlds remained in the terrestrial zone, where Earth and its neighboring planets eventually formed.\n\n\"Jupiter didn't just become the biggest planet -- it set the architecture for the whole inner solar system,\" Izidoro said. \"Without it, we might not have Earth as we know it.\"\n\nThe team's conclusions align with ring-and-gap patterns now seen in the disks of young star systems observed through the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope in northern Chile. These structures show how forming giant planets can reshape their surroundings.\n\n\"Looking at those young disks, we see the beginning of giant planets forming and reshaping their birth environment,\" Izidoro said. \"Our own solar system was no different. Jupiter's early growth left a signature we can still read today, locked inside meteorites that fall to Earth.\"\n\nThis research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the NSF-funded Big-Data Private-Cloud Research Cyberinfrastructure and Rice's Center for Research Computing.",

NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nWritten by Diana Hayes, Graduate Student at York University, Toronto\n\nEarth planning date: Friday, Oct. 10, 2025\n\nThis week was one of seasonal changes and milestones for the mission. As was mentioned several weeks ago, Mars has now moved out of its “cloudy season” and is transitioning into the “dusty season” as the planet moves closer to the Sun. This means that we should expect to see an increase in dust lifting and dust-devil activity over the next several months. With more dust in the atmosphere, we expect to lose the beautifully clear skies that have allowed us to take pictures of features at tremendous distances from the rover, like a mountain 57 miles (91 kilometers) away, outside of Gale Crater. We'll also be keeping an eye out for the possible development of a global dust storm this season, as one has not occurred since 2018.\n\nBack in August, we celebrated 13 Earth years since Curiosity landed in Gale back in 2012. This Monday, Oct. 6, a bit after 1 a.m. UTC (8 p.m. EDT Oct. 5), our intrepid rover marked its seventh full Mars year on the surface. (Because Mars is farther from the Sun than Earth is, a year on Mars — or one full trip around the Sun — lasts 687 Earth days.) Curiosity is only the second vehicle on Mars to reach that milestone, behind only Opportunity. Although Curiosity has not yet matched Opportunity's longevity or distance driven, over the last seven Mars years we have put together the longest and most comprehensive record of the modern Martian climate. REMS has been recording weather conditions at least once an hour almost every hour since 2012, and RAD has now measured surface radiation conditions for more than a full solar cycle, data that will be critical to future human exploration of Mars. We've taken more than 3,000 cloud movies and countless more observations of atmospheric opacity, dust lifting, and dust-devil activity. I've been a member of our environmental science team for just over five (Earth) years now (or about 2 ½ Mars years), and I can still hardly believe that I've been able to help contribute to this incredible legacy. Although our well-traveled rover is now in its fifth Extended Mission, as a team we have no intention of slowing down any time soon.\n\nOther than celebrating these milestones, this week was focused on setting up for the first of our two planned drills in the boxwork region. This first drill will be in one of the boxwork “hollows.” We’re currently targeting a hollow we've nicknamed “Monte Grande,” with the goal that we'll be set up to drill there next week. Once we're done at Monte Grande, we plan to drive up to one of the raised ridges that give the boxwork region its spiderweb-like appearance. By comparing the results of these two drill campaigns, our hope is that we'll be able to gain a better understanding of the processes in Mars’ past that led to the formation of these fascinating features.\n\nAs we prepare to drill, both science theme groups continued their usual cadence of contact science and remote sensing to characterize the local geology and environment. This weekend will be particularly busy on the environmental science side of the mission, with coordinated observations with APXS and ChemCam to track seasonal changes in the composition of the atmosphere. We'll also be using SAM’s Tunable Laser Spectrometer instrument to measure the amount of atmospheric methane at Gale. This is an activity that we’ve performed periodically over the mission, and has inspired much spirited debate over the sources and destruction mechanisms of Martian methane.\n\nHere’s to many more years of roving and scientific discovery!",

Un año marciano dura unos 687 días terrestres, por lo que completar siete años marcianos significa que Curiosity ha estado en Marte por más de 13 años terrestres.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El 6 de octubre de 2025, Curiosity celebró su séptimo año marciano completo en la superficie del cráter Gale. Recientemente, el rover tomó una nueva imagen que muestra su camino y el próximo lugar para perforar llamado “Monte Grande”. Curiosity se está preparando para perforar allí como parte de su trabajo científico. Mientras tanto, Marte está cambiando de una “temporada nublada” a una “temporada polvorienta”, lo que significa más polvo en el aire y posibles tormentas de polvo.\n\n**Impacto** – Curiosity ha reunido el registro más largo y detallado del clima y ambiente marcianos, incluyendo datos meteorológicos cada hora y mediciones de radiación en la superficie durante un ciclo solar completo. Esta información ayuda a los científicos a comprender mejor Marte y a planear futuras misiones humanas. El trabajo del rover al perforar y analizar formaciones rocosas como la región de boxwork revelará cómo cambió la superficie marciana.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El rover perforará pronto en el hueco Monte Grande y luego se moverá a crestas cercanas para comparar los resultados. Los científicos continuarán monitoreando los cambios estacionales en la atmósfera, incluyendo la medición del metano, que sigue siendo un misterio. Estos esfuerzos ampliarán el conocimiento sobre la geología y el clima de Marte.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Tras siete años marcianos, Curiosity sigue explorando y estudiando el cráter Gale, proporcionando datos valiosos sobre el ambiente de Marte y preparándose para nuevos descubrimientos con sus próximas perforaciones.",

      "title": "A fierce crocodile ancestor that hunted before dinosaurs has been found",
      "summary": "Scientists have identified a new crocodile precursor that looked deceptively dinosaur-like and hunted with speed and precision. Named Tainrakuasuchus bellator, the armored “warrior” lived 240 million years ago and occupied a powerful niche in the Triassic food chain. Its fossils reveal deep evolutionary links between South America and Africa. The find sheds light on a vibrant ecosystem that existed just before dinosaurs emerged.",
      "content": "A newly identified carnivorous reptile may look like a dinosaur at first glance, but researchers have confirmed that it was actually an early relative of modern crocodiles.\n\nThe species is named Tainrakuasuchus bellator, a title partly inspired by the Latin word for \"warrior\" or \"fighter.\" This armored animal lived 240 million years ago, during a time just before dinosaurs appeared.\n\nAs a member of the Pseudosuchia (the precursors of modern crocodiles and alligators), it belonged to a dominant group of predators that thrived in the Triassic Period.\n\nSize, Hunting Skills, and Early Ecosystem Role\n\nDetails of the discovery appear in the peer-reviewed Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. According to the study, the creature measured about 2.4m in length and weighed around 60kg.\n\nIts long neck and agile body allowed it to strike quickly at prey. Once it closed in, it used slender jaws filled with sharp, recurved teeth to secure its target and prevent escape.\n\n\"This animal was an active predator, but despite its relatively large size, it was far from the largest hunter of its time with the same ecosystem home to giants as big as seven meters long,\" explains lead author Dr. Rodrigo Temp Müller, who led the paleontology team at the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria in Brazil.\n\n\"Pseudosuchia were a diverse group of animals capable of tackling robust prey, as well as small hunters specialized in catching swift animals.\n\n\"Although its appearance superficially resembles that of a dinosaur, Tainrakuasuchus bellator does not belong to that group. One of the clearest ways for us to distinguish it from dinosaurs lies in the structure of the pelvis where the characteristics of its hip and femur joints are very different.\"\n\nA Glimpse Into Pre-Dinosaur Biodiversity\n\nDr. Müller notes: \"Tainrakuasuchus bellator's discovery represents the complexity of the ecosystem at the time, with different pseudosuchia species -- varying in sizes and hunting strategies -- occupying specific ecological niches.\n\n\"Its discovery helps illuminate a key moment in the history of life, the period that preceded the rise of the dinosaurs.\"\n\nThe fossils were uncovered during a May 2025 excavation in the municipality of Dona Francisca in southern Brazil. The team found a partial skeleton encased in rock that included portions of the lower jaw, vertebrae, and pelvic girdle.\n\nAnalysis of the bones revealed details about the animal's behavior and confirmed that Tainrakuasuchus bellator was protected by bony plates called osteoderms, which are also found in today's crocodiles.\n\nAlthough its limbs were not preserved, the researchers believe it moved on all fours, similar to related species.\n\nMeaning Behind the Name\n\nThe name 'Tainrakuasuchus' blends the Guarani words tain (\"tooth\") and rakua (\"pointed\") with the Greek suchus (\"crocodile\"), referring to its sharp teeth.\n\nThe second part, 'bellator,' comes from the Latin word for \"warrior\" or \"fighter\" and, according to the authors, \"honors the people of Rio Grande do Sul, symbolizing their strength, resilience, and fighting spirit, especially in light of the recent floods that have affected the state.\"\n\nRare Fossil With Links Across Ancient Pangaea\n\nDr. Müller describes the find as \"extremely rare\" and says it provides more evidence of the ancient connection between Brazil and Africa during the Triassic Period -- when the world's landmasses were joined into the supercontinent Pangaea.\n\n\"Despite the diversity of pseudosuchians, they remain poorly understood, as fossils of some their lineages are extremely rare in the fossil record,\" Dr. Müller says.\n\n\"The fossils we found underwent a meticulous preparation process in the laboratory, during which the surrounding rock was carefully removed.\n\n\"Once the anatomical details were revealed, we were delighted and really excited to reveal that the specimen represented a species previously unknown to science.\n\n\"What we uncovered was a species that belongs to a predator closely related to one (Mandasuchus tanyauchen) found in Tanzania.\n\n\"This connection between animals from South America and Africa can be understood in light of the Triassic Period's paleogeography.\n\n\"At that time, the continents were still united, which allowed the free dispersal of organisms across regions that are now separated by oceans. As a result, the faunas of Brazil and Africa shared several common elements, reflecting an intertwined evolutionary and ecological history.\n\n\"Tainrakuasuchus bellator would have lived in a region bordering a vast, arid desert -- the same setting as where the first dinosaurs emerged.\n\n\"It shows that, in what is now southern Brazil, reptiles had already formed diverse communities adapted to various survival strategies. Moreover, this discovery reveals that such diversity was not an isolated phenomenon.\"",
