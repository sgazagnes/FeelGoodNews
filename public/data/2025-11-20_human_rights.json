      "summary": "Sport has always been more than a contest of strength or skill. At its best, it becomes a rare space where people meet as equals – a reminder, as the President of the UN General Assembly put it on Wednesday, that “even in times of division, humanity can find common ground through sport – and an enduring hope.”",
      "content": "Speaking ahead of the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, Annalena Baerbock recalled her years as a young trampoline gymnast chasing the Olympic dream – and the sense of unity that sport can forge, even between rivals.\n\nThe Olympic Truce, she said, is a powerful symbol of that possibility – “a living metaphor of what peace requires: discipline, respect and courage needed to build peace.”\n\nExamples from recent decades show how powerful that metaphor can be in practice.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Open Fun Football Schools brought together more than 150,000 children across ethnic divides in the Balkans, using play to rebuild trust after conflict.\n\nSimilar programmes in Colombia and Cyprus have helped fractured communities slowly rediscover confidence through shared games, shared goals, and shared ground.\n\nUN Photo/Evan Schneider General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock (left) chairs the Sport for Development and Peace: Building a Peaceful and Better World through Sport and Olympic Ideal meeting.\n\nEquality at home\n\nSport’s ability to break down barriers is not only about peace between nations – it is also about equality at home.\n\nTweet URL\n\nGender equality featured prominently in the Assembly President’s remarks. She celebrated the defiant spirit of Canada’s women’s hockey team, who claimed Olympic gold at Sochi 2014 and famously embraced the taunt “Play like a girl?” with the reply: Yes – “fast and strong like girls.”\n\nTheir message, she said, pushes back against the stereotypes that continue to limit women and girls far beyond sport.\n\nMilano-Cortina 2026 is set to be the most gender-balanced Winter Games yet, with women expected to make up 47 per cent of the athletes.\n\nItalian promise\n\nItaly has committed to ensuring that the Games advance inclusion and accessibility both on and off the ice, supported by hundreds of planned legacy projects.\n\nThe Italian delegation also highlighted moments of extraordinary sportsmanship that embody the Olympic spirit, recalling the generosity of bobsledder Eugenio Monti, who famously lent his rivals equipment during the 1964 Innsbruck Games – an act that cost him victory that day but earned him lasting respect.\n\n“Sport and the Olympic Games can provide a beacon of hope, an alternative to rivalry and division,” Italy’s representative said.\n\nAs the world looks towards the winter games, the UN’s message is simple: the values learned on the field – fairness, courage, teamwork – are the same values needed to build a more peaceful and inclusive world.",

It reminds people that sport can bring different groups together, even in difficult times.\n\n**What happened** – Before the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, Annalena Baerbock, President of the UN General Assembly, spoke about how sport creates unity. She shared examples like football programs in the Balkans and Colombia that helped children from divided communities build trust. She also praised women’s achievements in sport, such as Canada’s women’s hockey team winning gold and challenging stereotypes.\n\n**Impact** – These examples show how sport can do more than entertain. It helps heal conflicts, promote gender equality, and include people with different abilities. Milano-Cortina 2026 will be the most gender-balanced Winter Games ever, with almost half of the athletes expected to be women. Italy is also working to make the Games accessible for all.\n\n**What's next step** – The upcoming Winter Olympics will put these values into action, showing how sport can inspire fairness, courage, and teamwork.

Instead, it should contribute to global efforts to curb climate change by approving the Escazú agreement. “As the world comes together to tackle the climate crisis at COP30 in Brazil, its Congress is considering proposals that would exacerbate it,” said César Muñoz, Brazil director at Human Rights Watch. “Brazil’s elected leaders should protect basic rights, which are under threat from environmental degradation and global warming.”Thousands of government officials, experts, journalists, environmental defenders, and representatives from nongovernmental organizations and business are gathered at the 30th annual United Nations climate summit (COP30), which runs through November 21, 2025, in the Brazilian city of Belém.Meanwhile, in Brasilia, some lawmakers are promoting measures that would undermine the conference’s objectives, Human Rights Watch said. The Senate announced a joint session of both chambers of the National Congress for November 27 to review the General Environmental Licensing Law. In July, lawmakers had approved the law, called the “devastation bill” by its opponents for eliminating environmental requirements and protections. In August, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, signed the law, though he vetoed some problematic provisions.Congress can override Lula’s vetoes by securing majorities in each house; 257 votes in the Chamber of Deputies and 41 in the Senate. Lawmakers could reinstate a vetoed provision that would allow those proposing small or medium sized projects with alleged small or medium environmental impact potential to obtain licenses simply by filling out an environmental adherence form, without any need for environmental impact assessments.A study by the Climate Observatory, a coalition of Brazilian environmental organizations, found that among the projects that would be included in that category would be dams like the one that collapsed in Brumadinho on January 25, 2019, causing 270 deaths and very extensive environmental damage. Congress could also reintroduce provisions that would reduce the protection of Indigenous and rural Afro-Brazilian communities whose territories have not been formally recognized by the authorities.Congress is also considering at least seven proposals to suspend the National Plan to Protect Human Rights Defenders. Established by federal decree in November, the plan seeks to strengthen coordination of policies and programs to protect individual human rights defenders and communities under threat, and guarantees civil society participation in monitoring its implementation. Brazilian human rights organizations had been pressing successive governments to develop such a plan for 20 years.In 2007, the government issued a decree that required the creation of the plan within 90 days, but it never happened. Ten years later, federal prosecutor Enrico Rodrigues de Freitas sued the federal government to force it to comply with the decree, and in 2021, in response, a federal court ordered the government to design the plan. In 2022, in the Sales Pimenta case, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered Brazil to create a working group to develop actions to address the causes of violence against defenders.The Brazilian government established the Sales Pimenta working group, whose members were authorities and civil society representatives in equal numbers, which drafted the plan. At a COP30 event on November 16, Rodrigues de Freitas said that suspension of the plan by Congress “would violate domestic and international judicial decisions.”Congress should not just refrain from suspending the decree that established the plan, but the protection of rights defenders by turning the plan into a law Human Rights Watch said. The Sales Pimenta working group developed a draft bill with that goal, Rodrigues de Freitas said.The human rights and citizenship minister, Macaé Evaristo, said at a COP30 event that 1,458 people are enrolled in the federal program to protect human rights defenders, many of whom defend land rights or the environment.The Pastoral Land Commission, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the Catholic Church, reported that 13 people were killed in conflicts over the use of land and resources in 2024, while it had documented 272 death threats. The urgency of the plan was highlighted on November 16, when gunmen killed an Indigenous man and injured four others during an attack within an Indigenous territory that is in the process of being demarcated.Ratification of the Escazú agreement, a landmark treaty for Latin American and Caribbean nations that advances the right to a healthy environment, would strengthen protection of environmental defenders, Human Rights Watch said. In addition, the treaty ensures access to information, public participation in decision-making, and pathways to prevent and redress environmental harm.

At the same time, Brazil’s Congress is debating laws that could reduce environmental protections and threaten a plan to protect human rights defenders.\n\n**What happened** – Human Rights Watch called on Brazil’s Congress to reject proposals that would weaken environmental licensing rules and suspend the National Plan to Protect Human Rights Defenders. The Congress is considering reinstating parts of a law that allows small and medium projects to get environmental licenses without proper impact studies. This could include dangerous projects like dams similar to the one that collapsed in Brumadinho in 2019. Lawmakers are also reviewing proposals that could reduce protections for Indigenous and Afro-Brazilian communities. Meanwhile, the Congress is deciding whether to approve the Escazú agreement, a treaty that supports environmental rights and protects people who defend the environment.\n\n**Impact** – Weakening environmental rules risks more damage like the Brumadinho dam disaster, which killed 270 people and caused severe harm. Cutting protections for human rights defenders could increase violence against those who protect land and nature. The National Plan to Protect Human Rights Defenders, created after years of pressure and court orders, currently helps over 1,400 people at risk. Approving the Escazú agreement would improve access to environmental information, involve the public in decisions, and offer legal tools to prevent harm. This treaty is seen as a key step to protect both the environment and the people defending it.\n\n**What's next step** – The Congress will hold a joint session on November 27 to review the environmental licensing law and decide on the future of the human rights defenders’ plan. The Senate still needs to approve the Escazú agreement after the Chamber of Deputies passed it in early November. Human Rights Watch and others hope lawmakers will strengthen protections by turning the defenders’ plan into law and fully supporting the Escazú treaty.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Brazil’s lawmakers face a critical choice to protect the environment and human rights defenders or risk worsening climate damage and violence during a key global summit.",

In the past 12 months alone, 12.5 million young women aged 15-19 have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner.\n\n“The data shows that many women first experience violence from a partner when they are adolescents. And many children grow up watching their mothers being pushed, hit or humiliated, with violence a part of daily life,” said Catherine Russell, Executive Director of the child rights agency UNICEF.\n\nThe key is to break this pattern, she added.\n\nAction, support and investment\n\nThe report was released ahead of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and Girls, observed annually on 25 November.\n\nIt calls for decisive government action and funding to scale-up evidenced-based prevention programmes and to strengthen health, legal and social services for survivors.\n\nCountries must also invest in data systems to track progress and reach those groups most at risk, in addition to enforcing laws and policies that empower women and girls.\n\n“No society can call itself fair, safe or healthy while half its population lives in fear,” said Tedros.\n\n“Ending this violence is not only a matter of policy; it is a matter of dignity, equality and human rights.”\n\nSalma’s dream\n\nSalma* is now back at school, after a judge eventually released her to her parents.\n\nShe was also referred to safe space supported by the UN reproductive agency, UNFPA, where she learned about her rights, and stands firm in her dream to become a doctor.\n\n“We must act urgently together to end this violence and ensure that every woman and girl, in all her diversity, can exercise her rights, realize her potential and contribute fully to more just, equal and prosperous societies,” said Diene Keita, UNFPA Executive Director.\n\n*Name changed for protection.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Around one in three women globally have experienced violence from a partner, a problem that has barely improved in over 20 years. Many cases remain hidden due to fear and stigma.\n\n**What happened** – The World Health Organization (WHO) and UN agencies released a report analyzing data from 168 countries between 2000 and 2023. It highlights the ongoing crisis of physical and sexual violence against women, including new estimates of violence from non-partners. The report also shows that funding for prevention programs is very low and has decreased.\n\n**Impact** – This report is important because it reveals how widespread and persistent violence against women is, starting often in teenage years, and how little progress has been made. It shows that millions of women suffer serious health and emotional harm. The data provides clear evidence that more support and stronger laws are needed to protect women and girls.\n\n**What's next step** – The report calls for governments to increase funding for prevention and survivor support programs, improve data collection, and enforce laws that empower women. It encourages urgent, coordinated action to break the cycle of violence and help survivors rebuild their lives.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new global report exposes ongoing violence against women and demands stronger action and investment to protect their rights and safety.\n\n",
      "personality_title_fr": "Un nouveau rapport demande une action urgente pour mettre fin à la violence contre les femmes dans le monde",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Environ une femme sur trois dans le monde a subi des violences de la part d’un partenaire, un problème qui a peu évolué depuis plus de 20 ans. Beaucoup de cas restent cachés par peur et honte.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – L’Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) et des agences de l’ONU ont publié un rapport analysant des données de 168 pays de 2000 à 2023. Il souligne la crise persistante des violences physiques et sexuelles contre les femmes, y compris des nouvelles estimations sur les violences commises par des personnes autres que le partenaire. Le rapport montre aussi que les financements pour la prévention sont très faibles et ont diminué.\n\n**Impact** – Ce rapport est important car il révèle à quel point la violence contre les femmes est répandue et persistante, souvent dès l’adolescence, et combien peu de progrès ont été réalisés. Il montre que des millions de femmes subissent des dommages graves à leur santé et à leur bien-être. Ces données montrent clairement qu’il faut plus de soutien et de lois fortes pour protéger les femmes et les filles.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le rapport appelle les gouvernements à augmenter les financements pour les programmes de prévention et d’aide aux victimes, à améliorer la collecte de données et à appliquer des lois qui renforcent les droits des femmes. Il encourage une action urgente et coordonnée pour briser le cycle de la violence et aider les survivantes à reconstruire leur vie.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Un nouveau rapport mondial révèle la violence persistante contre les femmes et demande plus d’action et d’investissements pour protéger leurs droits et leur sécurité.\n\n",
      "personality_title_es": "Nuevo informe pide acción urgente para acabar con la violencia contra las mujeres en el mundo",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Cerca de una de cada tres mujeres en el mundo ha sufrido violencia por parte de su pareja, un problema que ha cambiado muy poco en más de 20 años. Muchos casos no se denuncian por miedo y vergüenza.\n\n**Qué pasó** – La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y agencias de la ONU publicaron un informe con datos de 168 países entre 2000 y 2023. El informe destaca la crisis continua de violencia física y sexual contra las mujeres, incluyendo nuevas cifras sobre violencia de personas que no son parejas. También muestra que la financiación para programas de prevención es muy baja y ha disminuido.\n\n**Impacto** – Este informe es importante porque muestra cuán común y persistente es la violencia contra las mujeres, que muchas veces comienza en la adolescencia, y que se ha avanzado poco. Revela que millones de mujeres sufren graves daños físicos y emocionales. Los datos muestran claramente la necesidad de más apoyo y leyes más fuertes para proteger a mujeres y niñas.\n\n**Próximos pasos** – El informe pide a los gobiernos que aumenten la financiación para programas de prevención y apoyo a las víctimas, mejoren la recolección de datos y apliquen leyes que empoderen a las mujeres. Llama a una acción urgente y coordinada para romper el ciclo de violencia y ayudar a las sobrevivientes a reconstruir sus vidas.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Un nuevo informe mundial revela la violencia persistente contra las mujeres y exige mayor acción e inversión para proteger sus derechos y seguridad.\n\n",
