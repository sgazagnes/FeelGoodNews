      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 06 February 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04160-8War and political unrest can force staff members and students to uproot their lives, exacting a heavy personal and professional toll.",
      "content": "“I will never forget that Saturday evening when I first saw Russian tanks on the streets of my city,” says Viktoriya Voropayeva, a systems engineer and vice-rector at the Donetsk National Technology University (DonNTU). In 2014, after Russian-backed forces took over Donetsk, the unofficial capital of Ukraine’s Donbas region, Voropayeva and many of her colleagues chose to leave, setting up their university in exile. “We hoped that it would be one semester or one academic year,” she says about the university’s relocation to Drohobych in western Ukraine. “Nobody thought that it could be forever.” Her family left with only their documents, family photos and their cat.\n\nThe university’s first new home was in Pokrovsk, a small city about 60 kilometres away from Donetsk, still in the Donbas region, where it already had a sister institution. About one-third of its students and staff members moved into three academic buildings and two dormitories. “Most of the teachers who stayed in Donetsk did so not because they supported the Donetsk People’s Republic [the separatist government created by Russia-backed paramilitaries in 2014], but because they could not find the strength to leave everything — homes, elderly parents, hospitals, schools,” says Voropayeva.\n\nIn April 2022, two months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the university moved again. It went to Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine, to a building offered by Lutsk National Technical University. Then, seven months later, it moved to its current base in Drohobych in the Lviv region, about 1,050 km from its original home. The city council offered several buildings to turn into offices and classrooms. The space is much smaller than the facilities in Donetsk, but since the war started, most classes are now held online. DonNTU went from an 18,000-strong student body and more than 2,000 staff members in 2013, to 1,180 students and 116 staff members in 2024.\n\nHow the invasion of Ukraine is affecting Russian expat researchers The European nation is not the only place where war or political unrest has forced universities and their staff members into exile. Others around the world, including in Sudan and Myanmar, have also had to relocate. Some institutions have instead moved teaching online and found new ways to reach students and faculty members. What unites scholars is a will to keep education and scholarship alive, retaining a sense of community and, in some cases, the hope that they can return and be part of a better future in their homelands.\n\nVoropayeva says DonNTU continues to maintain close ties with local schools and the community in Donetsk, organizing webinars and courses for schoolchildren and teachers. But it, and other displaced universities in Ukraine, are now also serving local students from their new locations and recruiting local staff members. More than 50% of DonNTU first-year students are from the Lviv region.\n\nCheckpoint challenges\n\nIllya Khadzhynov, an economist and vice-rector for scientific work, was last in Donetsk in July 2014, when his institution, Donetsk National University (DonNU) was taken over by the pro-Russian separatist government. Students and academics protested to the Ukrainian government. It authorized the university’s roughly 700-km move west to a former jewellery factory in Vinnytsia, in the west-central region of Ukraine, a building with no lecture theatres or laboratories. DonNU’s plight prompted an unofficial motto that “the university is not only the walls, it’s the people”, says Khadzhynov. But with support from international donors, including US$350,000 from the International Renaissance Foundation, a Ukrainian charity founded by Hungarian-born US philanthropist George Soros, DonNU refurbished the factory building and re-established a campus there, including labs for research and teaching.\n\nKhadzhynov estimates that about half of the university’s 12,000 students moved to Vinnytsia. In 2016, the institution changed its name to Vasyl’ Stus Donetsk National University, honouring its alumnus Vasyl Stus, a poet who died in a labour camp after going on hunger strike after his arrest for anti-Soviet activity in 1980.\n\nSerhii Radio, a chemistry researcher at DonNU, says that back in 2014, not everyone felt able to leave everything behind. Those who did took only “the most necessary things that you can carry in two hands”, he says. He was unable to take any lab equipment that might stand out at the checkpoints they had to pass, controlled by armed pro-Russian separatist groups. “They checked personal belongings, scrolled through the contents of smartphones, examined saved photos and music, and even reviewed social-media accounts,” he explains.\n\nI fled the war in Ukraine. Now I work on ways to help the country’s soil heal Khadzhynov says that the arrival of DonNU initially created tensions in Vinnytsia because the institution was larger and therefore had been allotted many more student places by the government than had local universities. But now, the institution is more integrated into the local community and DonNU students are mostly from Vinnytsia and neighbouring regions. Their current 650-strong staff includes 180 who have been displaced from other cities.\n\nThe war itself has brought the added problem of electricity cuts, which make it difficult for Radio to perform experiments for his studies using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. “An experiment needs more than eight hours, and this is a very long time for electricity,” he says. At DonNTU, Voropayeva says: “Laboratory equipment has been in storage since 2022 or was destroyed during shelling.” The university is gradually restoring its labs, and a pooled centre for collective use of scientific equipment enables Ukrainian academic institutions to share resources, sometimes on a fee-for-service basis. DonNTU plans to provide access to its mobile ‘makerspace’, a computing cluster and a 3D-modelling centre.\n\nFaculty members and students from both former Donetsk institutions report problems in finding affordable accommodation in their new, smaller cities. Salaries have become catastrophically low — Voropayeva says that a full-time associate professor receives the equivalent of €300–350 (US$350–410) a month, which is comparable to pre-war wages but now buys considerably less because of rising prices.\n\nAnother challenge for both institutions has been the move from the heavily industrial Donbas, where many institutions excelled in applied science, to a region with a different industrial history. DonNTU had particular expertise in coal mining and metallurgy but is now shifting teaching and industrial collaboration to areas such as composite materials, chemicals and natural-gas extraction, which are more in demand in western Ukraine.\n\nRussians in exile\n\nThe war in Ukraine has also forced some Russian academics into exile. Art historian Philip Fedchin was a staff member at the Smolny College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in St Petersburg, Russia — a collaboration forged in 1997 between Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, and St Petersburg State University. Smolny was the first liberal-arts college in Russia, awarding degrees from 2003 and following a broad multidisciplinary curriculum. But in June 2021, Bard College was declared an “undesirable” organization by the Russian prosecutor’s general office and all ties were cut.\n\n“Everybody at the university in Smolny was shocked. It was considered the worst possible scenario, but it was just one of the few minor signs of what is going to come,” says Fedchin, referencing the looming war with Ukraine. Many faculty members and students left the country when the invasion of Ukraine started in February 2022, he adds, with more following that September, when Russia began its mobilization of reservists into the military. Fedchin left Russia in 2020 owing to his opposition to the country’s political direction. He relocated to Germany, joining Bard College Berlin, where he now works as a technology strategist.\n\nIn November 2022, Fedchin and his colleagues launched Smolny Beyond Borders, a university-in-exile initiative that enables many former Smolny faculty members to teach courses online with a similar ethos to the original Smolny College. So far, they have taught 2,585 students. Last semester, they ran 23 courses and now offer a two-year associate-degree programme accredited by Bard College.\n\nFedchin says that about 50% of its students taking non-degree courses are in Russia. Only displaced students are eligible to enrol for its degree programmes, and are taught by displaced faculty members located all over the world.\n\nOne of those is Andrei Rodin, a researcher in the history and philosophy of mathematics. He and his family relocated from Russia to France in March 2022, where, as well as teaching maths and statistics for Smolny Beyond Borders, he has a temporary teaching position at the University of Lorraine in Nancy.\n\nThe ambitions of Smolny Beyond Borders have now grown to supporting a broader community of students in exile from other parts of the world through two Bard partner organizations. One is the Global Higher Education Alliance for the 21st Century network, which provides opportunities for students to pursue learning, and the other is the Realizing Higher Education Access Program, a 12-month bridging programme intended to prepare refugee students for university. It is currently under way in Kenya, Jordan, Bangladesh and parts of East Africa. “My group has become much more international,” says Rodin. “I have students from Afghanistan, from Africa, from refugee camps.”\n\nFleeing civil war in Sudan\n\nGihad Ibrahim fled his home in the Sudanese city of Khartoum North soon after the civil war broke out in April 2023. Most of the population in affected regions escaped to other parts of the African country, or to neighbouring nations. A large number moved to Cairo, including Ibrahim, an engineer who taught at Mashreq University and Sudan University of Science and Technology. The two institutions both abandoned their main campuses in the Khartoum region.\n\nThe civil war has devastated higher education. “Some of the universities are still not working today,” says Ibrahim. Others, including the University of Khartoum, have adopted online teaching and have set up centres in regional universities to host exams and crucial practical training in subjects such as medicine.\n\nSalaries for most academics were reduced to 60% of the original amount for the first 9–12 months of the war, although they have subsequently rebounded, says Ibrahim. Pointing to one positive, he describes how displaced medical students created medical camps to try to care for locals in those areas, even with the little experience they had.\n\nEngineer Gihad Ibrahim had to leave his home in the Sudanese city of Khartoum North when civil war broke out.Credit: Mashreq University\n\nSome private universities have fared better than public ones. This includes the private Mashreq University, which specializes in applied science, engineering and medicine. It served 10,000 students at three campuses in and around Khartoum that had to close when fighting came to the region — so the university had to adapt.\n\nThe idea was for Mashreq University to establish mini teaching centres elsewhere, says Ibrahim, forging collaborations with the Red Sea University in Port Sudan, a city less affected by the war, and renting space in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In Cairo, Mashreq University rented an entire unused college building. “It also had its own laboratories, mainly focusing on the engineering side,” Ibrahim says, adding: “We had to re-establish and buy new equipment for all the laboratories related to the medical field.” A smaller number of students fled to the United Arab Emirates, from where they can access lectures that are live-streamed from the Cairo campus.\n\nA planned expansion of the medical college of Mashreq University into a university hospital has been abandoned, alongside its once-growing graduate faculty. Student numbers have also decreased by 45% owing to drop-outs and temporary suspensions of study. “Many students were not able to pay their fees because we had 300–400% inflation after the war and lots of people have lost their jobs,” says Ibrahim. The college has tried to provide scholarships where it can. After two-and-a-half years working this way, Ibrahim says with pride and determination that they are sustaining teaching “regardless of the difficult situation”.",

      "content": "Adam Levy 00:00\n\nHello, I’m Adam Levy, and this is Off Limits: Academia’s Taboos, a podcast from Nature Careers.\n\nIn this episode: alcohol.\n\nAlcohol and academia have a complex relationship. On the one hand, in many countries and contexts, consuming alcohol is incredibly normalized.\n\nIn fact, as we heard in last week’s episode, people who don’t drink for religious reasons can struggle to find social spaces in academia that don’t centre around drinking.\n\nAnd so it’s perhaps unsurprising that many academics can struggle with alcohol dependency.\n\nBut while alcohol consumption may be the norm, coming to terms with and openly discussing harmful relationships with the substance remain incredibly taboo.\n\nAnd today we’ll meet with two academics who’ve not only struggled with alcohol but also with sharing this struggle with others.\n\nBut both have found ways to transform both their lives and their work, to reflect their recoveries.\n\nThe first is Wendy Dossett. Wendy is a professor emeritus of religious studies at the University of Chester in the UK.\n\nOver her career, she’s investigated a number of questions related to faith.\n\nWendy Dossett 01:25\n\nIn the last decade or so of my career, I turned my religious studies methodologies onto the phenomenon of recovery from addiction.\n\nAdam Levy 01:36\n\nThis is a topic close to Wendy’s heart.\n\nAnd so we spoke about her journey with alcohol.\n\nBefore we start that conversation, please note that this interview does contain reference to sexual violence.\n\nWendy Dossett 01:50\n\nI am a person in in long-term recovery.\n\nI’ve been in in recovery for 20 years now, so I’m very lucky.\n\nBut looking back on my student days and my early career, alcohol was a terrible problem for me.\n\nMuch like lots of people who suffer with substance issues, I had low self esteem.\n\nI felt different from my peers. I felt that I didn’t fit in, and substance use enabled me to function for many years.\n\nIt felt like it was giving me confidence. It felt like it was enabling me to fit in. I experienced sexual abuse at the age of 21 and I reacted to that experience by drinking more, and my problems with alcohol escalated.\n\nI was first in my family to go to university, so I think I already had a legacy of feeling ”less than.”\n\nI felt that I wasn’t good enough to have the roles and responsibilities that I had. And I used alcohol, really, to manage my my feelings around all that.\n\nAdam Levy 03:04\n\nThe way you describe it is, of course, with hindsight.\n\nDid you have this kind of understanding at the time that alcohol was something you were using to cope with these other things in academia and in your personal life?\n\nWendy Dossett 03:17\n\nNot really. I think I felt like alcohol was the solution to my problems. I felt like it was the thing that was helping me to keep going. I felt I would never have a creative idea if I didn’t have the support of alcohol.\n\nSo alcohol felt like it was a fuel to my academic life. It also felt like that the lubrication for the social elements of academic life.\n\nA lot of it is about networking, and, you know, making friends with the right people, and, you know, being able to tell people your ideas in a confident manner.\n\nI probably had some kind of inkling that it was also causing me trouble, but that kind of remained at an unconscious level, really, all through my 20s.\n\nAnd it was only in my 30s that I began to realize that that alcohol was a problem for me.\n\nAdam Levy 04:21\n\nWere there any particular moments which, at the time, or perhaps in hindsight, really highlighted, ”Okay, this is becoming a problem.” And actually getting in the way of the things you thought it would be helping for?\n\nWendy Dossett 04:35\n\nThere were some spectacular ones and some just the daily grind of waking up every morning or coming round, I should say, every morning and trying to get myself ready to go to work.\n\nJust the awful hamster wheel, the daily grind, the effort that that took to keep going. Those were the kind of day in, day out realizations that there was there was something wrong.\n\nBut I had experiences. For example, I chaired an international symposium in blackout. You know, it doesn’t mean I was unconscious. It means that I have no memory of actually doing that.\n\nAt the end of it, a very good friend of mine, a colleague, said to me that they thought I needed to get some help, and that they were worried about my drinking.\n\nAdam Levy 05:31\n\nWere you surprised by this, I suppose almost intervention from a colleague?\n\nWendy Dossett 05:36\n\nIt was an intervention, and this was well over 20 years ago now, and I I look back on that moment with a mixture of horror and absolute gratitude that somebody had the courage and care for me, really, to actually say that they thought I had a problem.\n\nI was mortified. Absolutely mortified. But I did get in contact with a recovery community, even though it took me several months from that point to get, to actually get sober.\n\nAdam Levy 06:11\n\nI mean, you mentioned shame there. Is that something that previously prevented you from speaking with colleagues about your use of alcohol?\n\nWendy Dossett 06:19\n\nAbsolutely. You know, who would want to admit that they were out of control? You know, especially in academia, perhaps there is a great stigma around mental health problems.\n\nYou know, we’re supposed to be the brightest and the best, you know?\n\nWe’re supposed to be making contributions moving the frontiers of knowledge forward. We’re not supposed to be struggling with cognitive issues, mental health problems. We’re not supposed to be damaging ourselves in the way that somebody with an alcohol addiction is doing. So, yes, the stigma is a massive barrier to help-seeking.\n\nSo what we need to do is, is to firstly, to normalize the problem and to notice how widespread it is in in academia. And to dismantle the stigma and make it a positive thing, to to be able to mention it, to talk about it.\n\nI think we’ve made such great strides with, you know, especially depression and anxiety. But addiction is, is such a sticky stigma. It’s, it’s such a taboo.\n\nBecause there’s a kind of view in the general public that that we bring it upon ourselves, so that we have a choice\n\nAdam Levy 07:41\n\nAnd for you, then when you did start to seek help, is that also something you tried to keep hidden? Is that something you kept separate from your colleagues?\n\nWendy Dossett 07:53\n\nAbsolutely. I didn’t mention it to any colleagues for many years. Yeah, it took a very, very long time before I tentatively became open with immediate colleagues. Because academia is such a drinking culture, you’ve got a few options if you don’t drink.\n\nYou can lie about the reasons why you don’t drink. Or you can be honest about them. And I did lie for for many years. You know, ”I’m not drinking at the moment, I’m on antibiotics,” or, you know, ”I’m on some medication that that I can’t take alcohol with,” or whatever.\n\nBut over time, I became more comfortable, more secure in my own recovery status, and I think that gave me a little bit of confidence to raise it with peers and to say, ”Yeah, I don’t drink. And the reason is that that I’m addicted to it, and if I if I drink, I won’t be able to stop, so I just don’t do it”.\n\nBut it was a whole other thing to bring that up with senior members of the university. And I was anxious about many different things. I was anxious about causing myself issues with promotion or respect from senior colleagues, or, you know, trust from senior colleagues.\n\nAdam Levy 09:22\n\nAnd can I ask, I mean, you mentioned that at academic events with alcohol, at first, you found it very difficult to be open about how you were navigating alcohol. Were these events also challenging, just in terms of yourself and in terms of being in the context where drinking alcohol is not only the norm, but maybe also expected?\n\nWendy Dossett 09:45\n\nYes, it’s very difficult. I don’t know many people in recovery who are fully comfortable in an environment where there’s lots of alcohol, or lots of drunkenness.\n\nI find it quite difficult sometimes being around drunk colleagues. I think that is changing. I think there is a greater awareness of diversity in terms of people’s drinking practices.\n\nBut certainly in the early days of my recovery I found it incredibly difficult. Not necessarily because I might be tempted to drink, but that is always a possibility, but because I just found it so stressful to be in that environment. It would cause me flashbacks to to myself being drunk. I would find people’s kind of lack of rationality quite challenging.\n\nBut as a person in recovery, you see it from a very different perspective. And it is difficult. It’s difficult to be around it.\n\nAcademia has historically at least functioned around drinking.\n\nAlso other drugs as well, especially the kinds of drugs that enhance cognitive performance in the short term. And that is driven by the kind of pressure to deliver above and beyond the usual 9-5.\n\nIn order to be competitive in an academic environment, there is a sense that people feel they need to have some kind of enhanced performance in order to deliver. And that’s a real problem.\n\nAdam Levy 11:35\n\nNow you’ve actually turned some of your academic study to understanding the spiritual elements of recovery and some of the frameworks for recovery.\n\nWhat has it meant to you as an academic to be able to investigate these questions from this more academic side?\n\nWendy Dossett 11:52\n\nThat’s such a lovely question.\n\nIt’s meant the world to me. I felt as though this research really was me finding my academic voice, actually, and finding the contribution that I could make to the recovery world, and to the academic study of recovery.\n\nSo it was wonderful. You know, recovery from substance misuse is different to recovery from other kinds of mental health issues. Because that recovery scene is so inflected by ideas that people associate with spirituality.\n\nAnd of course, the recovery scene is not homogenous. There are many, different ways of recovering from alcohol or other drug use. But you know, because of the massive influence of the 12 step episteme, you know, with Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous.\n\nThose all derive from a spiritual notion that the person suffering with the addiction, their condition is a state of powerlessness, and their willpower is not sufficient to overcome the problem. So therefore they must access a higher power.\n\nPeople interpret that notion of higher power in very different, personal, nuanced ways that reflect the contemporary culture that they’re in. So I was, I was trying to show how members of 12 step programs are spiritual innovators in the way they they think about higher power.\n\nAdam Levy 13:42\n\nWhat does it mean to you to begin to be more open about this subject that does have so much stigma around it? I mean, you’re speaking to me now. You’re doing this research. You also spoke to Nature for a feature published back in 2025.\n\nWendy Dossett 13:59\n\nIt means a lot. It’s been a long and difficult journey to become more open. You know, although I openly say I’m in recovery, I always have that, that underlying anxiety that am I doing the right thing by saying that?\n\nBecause I want to be contributing to hope. And of course, if I don’t return to use then that’s that’s great. But I also know that I cannot be complacent about that.\n\nAdam Levy 14:29\n\nWhat would you have liked to have seen from colleagues in academia? What should academics listening do to better support their their colleagues who are going through challenges with dependency?\n\nWendy Dossett 14:41\n\nI’d love colleagues to become much more informed about addiction, and in particular, much more informed about recovery, and to know that recovery is possible.\n\nIn fact, recovery is probable.\n\nLots and lots of people do recover from addiction, and. And people should have hope and they should be encouraged.\n\nI think I’d like to see more compassion and more empathy.\n\nThere can often be a tendency to judge people who struggle with addiction. And, of course, somebody who is not functioning in an academic team that is under pressure is a passenger. And that’s very difficult for people. That needs to be acknowledged.\n\nI’d love it if more academics knew about the recovery-friendly university movement, and that means they’re actively seeking ways to support both staff and students who have substance issues.\n\nYou know, they are counteracting stigma. They’re saying that we are proud to have people in recovery within our university community.\n\nI think communities are the places in which recovery can happen in a in a community where there are people in recovery and they’re known and it’s seen that they’re welcomed and they’re celebrated, then that creates its own contagion. And it means that other people can find their way to recovery as well.\n\nSo universities are actually really places where we can seed recovery for the wider community.\n\nAdam Levy 16:28\n\nThat was Wendy Dossett. We’ll hear from her again in a later episode, as we discuss the struggles and stigma surrounding fertility.\n\nNext up, though, I spoke with another researcher, Victoria Burns, associate professor of social work at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nVictoria has also transformed her journey with alcohol into an integral part of her work. She is the founder and director of Recovery on Campus Alberta.\n\nWe’ll get to her work with this organization in just a moment.\n\nBut first we discussed how Victoria began to reflect on her relationship with alcohol.\n\nVictoria Burns 17:07\n\nI started to think about my relationship with alcohol more critically when I started university.\n\nI had my first drink when I was 12, and I didn’t really drink throughout high school, but when I did drink, I was prone to blacking out.\n\nAnd then I didn’t drink my first year of university.\n\nBut then my second year, I did an exchange program to France. And that’s where I really started to drink in earnest. And when I came back to Canada, (so I started going out to the clubs), and I was a weekend warrior.\n\nI’ll say I worked hard and played hard. I always held down jobs and was an A student. But I also started to drink more, and it was actually at 19 when a boyfriend gave me an ultimatum to stop drinking because I would black out and end up in risky situations.\n\nAdam Levy 18:13\n\nAnd has that been the case since then that you decided not to drink?\n\nVictoria Burn 18:18\n\nNo, so I did a lot more research. I said bye to the boyfriend, and thought that he was just being too controlling.\n\nAnd I was mainly a binge drinker. I wasn’t a daily drinker.\n\nAnd during that period, there were many, I guess, increasingly dangerous situations that I was in related to my drinking.\n\nSo I like to say every time I drank, something bad didn’t happen, but anytime something bad happened, alcohol was involved.\n\nAnd I sought therapy during this time because I couldn’t, I thought I just had to kind of get my anxiety under control, and then I’d be able to drink, quote, unquote, like a lady.\n\nBut once I started, I never knew when I was going to stop. So I ended up, in my second year of my PhD, hitting my final bottom, ending up in the hospital and that’s when I stopped.\n\nAdam Levy 19:19\n\nYou just kind of mentioned it in passing there. But did it shake you up quite a bit to end up having to seek, you know, medical support in this situation?\n\nVictoria Burns 19:28\n\nSo yes, I did. I did seek medical support earlier on at my university.\n\nI was at McGill University in Montreal. And after some particularly bad binges I went to the student wellness and no one really gave me supports related to my drinking.\n\nThey just told me I needed to drink less and were quite judgmental. And I ended up in the hospital a couple of times, but I was met with more shame than compassion, I’ll say.\n\nAnd when I ended up in the hospital, that last time, I ended up seeing three therapists, actually.\n\nIt was the abstinence-based one who had recommended I try AA. I ended up going to AA, to to an open speaker meeting that year, and hearing, I don’t know, it’s just ready, it’s it’s just, it doesn’t really make sense why it stuck that time, but it did.\n\nAnd then I found a woman’s meeting. And I had tried, actually, 14 months before my final bottom to go to rehab, but they wouldn’t accept me because I was quote, unquote, too organized as a full time student. I was married, I had a house, all of these things.\n\nSo on paper, things looked okay, but I was really dying inside.\n\nAdam Levy 20:52\n\nAnd now, after you did successfully go to AA and transition away from alcohol, how did you approach discussing, disclosing this with academic colleagues and with supervisors, for example?\n\nVictoria Burns 21:08\n\nSo I didn’t disclose to anybody in my academic circles, except for a couple of senior academics.\n\nAnd I didn’t tell my supervisors.\n\nI was advised by senior academics. I did tell not to tell anyone noise in recovery, because it could negatively affect my job prospects.\n\nI didn’t want to do anything that would negatively affect my career. So I really led a double life in recovery for the first five years. And I am a social work scholar. And this became increasingly unmanageable as well.\n\nAdam Levy 21:47\n\nNow you’ve actually done research to look at this kind of stigma that you’re talking about, in this reluctance to disclose that you’re talking about.\n\nWhat do we know about how researchers who struggle with substance dependence, disclose or don’t disclose?\n\nVictoria Burns 22:04\n\nIn 2018 I did disclose to my Dean. And I was prepared to leave my tenure track job because it was negatively affecting my recovery and my work.\n\nI was researching harm reduction and housing first at the time.\n\nSo I was bumping up against these conversations quite often, and I felt there was a really important perspective that I was not disclosing.\n\nSo I ended up disclosing to my Dean. He was very accepting. And he gave me a green light to conduct research in this area, because he said, out of his 26-year career, he never had anyone disclosed to him about being in recovery.\n\nAnd that really surprised me and intrigued me. And I thought, I can’t be the only one, when we look at the data, the prevalence of not only people in in recovery, but the rates of addiction.\n\nAnd I ended up getting a small grant and interviewed most of the Deans and other service providers about their experiences with faculty disclosing addiction and recovery.\n\nAnd there are only three disclosures out of over 300 years of service of all the people I interviewed. However, there were many incidents where faculty members were showing up to the classroom intoxicated or concerns about people’s drinking or drug use, but Deans and service providers not really knowing what that process was to help them.\n\nAnd several of the participants actually said, ”Well, as long as they’re bringing in grants, no one really cares.”\n\nAnd it’s also problematic, because like me, I have never met anyone in recovery in academia, and I was a student for 14 years.\n\nThat fed into the stigma as well, and the misunderstanding of what addiction and recovery are.\n\nSo one of the recommendations of this work was to shift more into this vulnerable, authentic leadership and role model.\n\nYou know, recovery is not something to be ashamed of. It’s something that’s actually a source of pride, often committed to service and helping others.\n\nSo these are people you do want, as colleagues, as leaders, and that was something that came out of that study.\n\nAdam Levy 24:29\n\nI find it almost paradoxical, because, on the one hand, alcohol is so visible in academia. You know, there’s so many contexts in academia, at least in certain countries where alcohol and also alcohol abuse can be quite visible.\n\nBut then there seems to be a silence around both the misuse of alcohol and the recovery from that misuse.\n\nVictoria Burns 24:53\n\nYeah, there definitely is a paradox around that. You’re stigmatized if you drink too. Much you’re stigmatized if you stop. You’re sort of damned if you do, damned if you don’t.\n\nI had been sober for about two years at the time, and I successfully passed my defence and my two supervisors, the tradition was to have some champagne, and they had known me as a drinker as well.\n\nBut they had the champagne, and everyone was around ready to celebrate, and my supervisor poured me a glass and said, ”For you.”\n\nAnd I said, ”No, thank you.” And he said, ”Come on, Victoria, you know you deserve it.” And I said, ”No, thank you” twice.\n\nAnd then the third time I said no, thank you. He said, ”Come on, it’s not like you’re an alcoholic.”\n\nAnd I took the glass and I pretended to drink it and then I threw it away, but it was such a common kind of innocuous tradition, seemingly.\n\nBut these are the kind of things we need to, I realize, educate people on how to be a recovery ally.\n\nBecause if I had not been as secure in my recovery, I think, you know, that could have been a really a shakier moment than it was.\n\nAnd I’m just really grateful that I was able to kind of push through that and not pick up. But these things happen all the time.\n\nAdam Levy 26:11\n\nNow you’ve alluded to this already, but you’ve kind of turned this stigma for yourself around to some extent, and you are actively trying to do work to support other academics who are going through recovery.\n\nCan you explain the work that you’re doing a little bit?\n\nVictoria Burns 26:27\n\nYeah, so another recommendation from that research was to start a peer support group for faculty. I was really committed to creating a recovery-friendly workplace.\n\nSo if someone did put their hand up and say, ”I’m struggling with substance use,” that they would get the help and be met with compassion and non judgment.\n\nThere wasn’t any recovery programs on campuses until 2019.\n\nAnd it was actually a student at University of British Columbia who started the first campus recovery program in Canada.\n\nAnd it was through that work, I was able to to hire a part time coordinator, and now we have 10 going on, 11 peer support meetings a week. We’ve grown from that $8,000 to over $5 million.\n\nAdam Levy 27:16\n\nWith this in mind, what’s your hope for the academia of the future, and academia where, instead of maybe exacerbating people’s issues around substances, we provide a more supportive environment?\n\nVictoria Burns 27:31\n\nI don’t want a student or a staff member to feel the shame and stigma of being in recovery or of seeking help.\n\nThe visibility of people in recovery, I think, is very important, because there’s still such a narrow perception of what it means to, well, A, have an addiction, and B, what it means to be in recovery.\n\nAnd really, we know that one of the pillars of recovery is purpose.\n\nSo allowing folks who go to treatment, they have that community on campus where they have a safe place to go, that we’re normalizing the idea that you could have a really enriching, fun, joyful university experience without the need to be intoxicated. It’s not about prohibition.\n\nThere are many people who can use substances and safety, but there are also many people who can’t.\n\nAnd up until recently, they didn’t really have that space where they could fully be themselves and be around others on similar paths.\n\nAdam Levy 28:39\n\nVictoria Burns there, joined, as you might have heard towards the end of the interview, by her cat Charlie.\n\nThis need to be around others on similar paths isn’t unique to alcohol.\n\nCommunity can be so important for each and every stigmatized subject we’ve touched on in this series, from coming out as LGBTQIA+, to navigating research with a disability. And this is equally important for the subject of next week’s episode: navigating grief.\n\nSpeaker 4 29:12\n\nI wished I had a grief group. I actually needed advice and directions and resources.\n\nAdam Levy 29:22\n\nUntil then, this has been Off Limits: Academia’s Taboos, a podcast from Nature Careers.\n\nThanks for listening.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Alcohol use is common in academic settings, often part of social and professional life. Yet, despite this, talking openly about alcohol problems remains rare and stigmatized among academics.\n\n**What happened** – Two academics, Wendy Dossett from the UK and Victoria Burns from Canada, shared their personal struggles with alcohol dependence and recovery. Both faced shame and silence but later used their experiences to help others. Wendy studies addiction recovery through the lens of spirituality, while Victoria founded Recovery on Campus Alberta, a support network for students and staff.\n\n**Impact** – Their stories reveal how stigma around addiction stops people from seeking help and sharing their experiences. By speaking out and creating recovery-friendly programs, they help change academic cultures that often expect drinking and hide addiction. These efforts promote understanding, compassion, and support within universities.\n\n**What’s next step** – The goal is to expand recovery-friendly environments in more universities, encouraging open conversations and peer support. This can help more academics and students get help without fear and reduce the isolation caused by addiction stigma.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Opening up about alcohol dependence in academia and building supportive communities can break stigma and help many find recovery and strength.\n",

      "content": "Yet even as the architecture weakens, signs of progress – including nuclear-weapon-free zones and rising youth engagement – offer grounds for cautious hope, a UN researcher on nuclear non-proliferation has told UN News.\n\nGaukhar Mukhatzhanova, a fellow with the UN Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) – an autonomous institute studying disarmament and international security issues – said that decades of arms control built through painstaking negotiations are now at risk of unravelling.\n\n“The situation right now is very difficult,” she added.\n\n“We are observing the disintegration of the arms control architecture that was built primarily through negotiations between [the then] Soviet Union – and subsequently Russia – and the United States.”\n\nUN Photo/Evan Schneider Gaukhar Mukhatzhanova, briefs the Security Council on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. (November 2025)\n\nArms control architecture under strain\n\nThat erosion has left the global non-proliferation regime increasingly fragile, with most Cold War-era agreements either abandoned or expired. The 2010 US-Russia New START accord – which capped deployed strategic nuclear warheads – expired this week without a successor in place.\n\nWhile both American and Russian presidents acknowledged the dangers of a renewed nuclear arms race, no replacement for the New START is currently under negotiation.\n\nThis is a troubling backdrop for the next review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), scheduled for April-May in New York, Ms. Mukhatzhanova said.\n\nOpened for signature in 1968 and extended indefinitely in 1995, the NPT remains the only binding multilateral treaty requiring nuclear-weapon States to pursue disarmament.\n\nHowever, the political conditions that once made cooperation possible have deteriorated sharply, added Ms. Mukhatzhanova.\n\n“We are back to a period of severe mistrust between the major actors – arguably worse than during the Cold War,” she said.\n\nWe are back to a period of severe mistrust between the major actors – arguably worse than during the Cold War\n\nChallenges and emerging risks\n\nStatements by the US suggesting a possible resumption of certain forms of nuclear testing have raised alarm, even if limited to so-called “subcritical experiments” – highly explosive tests where no chain reaction is involved.\n\nSuch moves, Ms. Mukhatzhanova said, risk undermining the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and reopening questions many hoped were settled.\n\n“If full-scale explosive testing were to return,” she warned, “we are talking about a really drastic and very negative change – one that would open the door for others to resume nuclear testing.”\n\nNew technology, new risks\n\nHypersonic weapons, autonomous systems and artificial intelligence are accelerating arms competition and increasing the risk of miscalculation.\n\n“The concern is that too much is left to the decision of a machine,” Ms. Mukhatzhanova said, warning that AI-driven early-warning systems could misinterpret data and trigger inadvertent escalation.\n\nShe noted recent UN resolutions calling for “meaningful human control” over nuclear-related technologies.\n\nUN Photo/Mitsugu Kishida Hiroshima, shortly after a nuclear bomb was dropped on this city in August 1945.\n\nRoom for progress remains\n\nDespite the grim outlook, she highlighted areas where progress continues.\n\nNuclear-weapon-free zones – covering Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and Central Asia – demonstrate how states can pursue security without nuclear weapons.\n\n“They are a feel-good story,” she said, describing them as practical examples of cooperation even amid global tensions. The Central Asian zone stands out for its strong verification standards and links to broader non-proliferation commitments.\n\nYoung people engaging\n\nMs. Mukhatzhanova also pointed to growing engagement by younger generations, who increasingly question the long-standing narrative that nuclear weapons guarantee security.\n\n“They are ready to challenge that framing,” she said. “That gives me hope.”\n\nWhile the arms control system may be fraying, she argued that history shows it can be rebuilt.",
