      "title": "How community solar turned a Superfund site into savings in Illinois",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nAs someone who spent several years as a workers’ rights organizer, Fredy Amador is intimately familiar with the financial struggles people face in the current economy. Northern Illinois’ skyrocketing energy bills make the situation even tougher.\n\nNow, Amador has become an evangelist for something that can provide a modest measure of relief: a community solar project, built on a Superfund site too polluted for much else in the city of Waukegan where he lives, about 40 miles north of Chicago.\n\nResidents who subscribe to get energy from the solar farm are guaranteed to see savings on their energy bills, under a state program incentivizing solar in low-income areas.\n\nThe 9.1-megawatt Yeoman Solar Project, which went online last month, can provide energy for about 1,000 households, as well as the Waukegan school district, which owns the land.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nThe school district bought the site in the 1950s hoping to build a new high school. But the land proved too swampy, and from 1958 to 1969 it was used as a dump for industrial and municipal waste. The highly contaminated Yeoman Creek Landfill was finally cleaned up 20 years ago, and now the district receives lease payments from CleanCapital, the national solar-investment company that owns and operates the solar farm.\n\nSuch brownfields are attractive locations for solar installations because of ​“existing electrical infrastructure, lower-cost land, and community acceptance,” noted Paul Curran, CleanCapital’s chief development officer. Incentives from the state initiative Illinois Solar for All helped make the project financially viable, even given extra costs incurred from building on a Superfund site.\n\nIt’s an example of how state policy can drive clean energy development and cost savings, even as federal tax credits for solar are being cut. The project also shows how solar can turn a community liability into an asset.\n\n“The Yeoman Solar Project encapsulates so much of solar’s promise,” said Andrew Linhares, senior manager for the central U.S. at the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. ​“The project instills new life into the Yeoman Creek Landfill Superfund site like only solar can.”\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nBuilding on pollution\n\nAs an unlined pit amid wetlands, the Yeoman Creek Landfill leached toxic chemicals into the environment, including its namesake creek. In 1989, the landfill was added to the Superfund list, the federal program that requires companies responsible for pollution to clean it up.\n\nThe remediation was completed in 2005, though gas release, groundwater, and sediment are still being monitored.\n\n“Since then, it’s been vacant,” and discussions started in 2012 regarding the fate of the land, said LeBaron Moten, deputy superintendent of Waukegan Community Unit School District No. 60.\n\n“There were not too many options on the table for this specific site. We couldn’t build anything on it,” Moten said. ​“Our main objective was to keep people off it.”\n\nThe Yeoman community solar project, dusted in an early-season snow.\n\nCleanCapital\n\nRepresentatives of the school district, the city, and the group of companies involved in the cleanup decided to pursue putting a solar farm on the site, and in 2017 the school district issued a request for proposals. A national developer experienced in building solar on landfills, BQ Energy, was selected. In 2022, it was acquired by CleanCapital, which launched construction of the project.\n\nMoten said the lease payments from CleanCapital and the energy savings from solar power will be helpful for the district, which serves over 13,000 students, the majority of whom are Latino and 68 percent of whom are considered low-income. The school district will be the project’s anchor tenant, using about 40 percent of the energy produced.\n\nSeven of the school district’s buildings have rooftop solar arrays, which are referenced in sustainability lessons in the classroom. Moten said he hopes Yeoman Solar will similarly factor into educating students about clean energy, and potentially preparing them for jobs in the industry.\n\nA new direction brings new challenges\n\nA longtime industrial hub, Waukegan is home to five Superfund sites. The city still has a lot of manufacturing, and until 2022 a large coal plant operated on the shore of Lake Michigan, not far from residents’ homes. That location remains contaminated with toxic coal ash. The community organization Clean Power Lake County and local activists have long demanded a just transition for Waukegan, in which economic opportunities and renewable energy benefit residents who have suffered from pollution.\n\nInstalling solar on brownfields is one way to accomplish this.\n\nSolar is a good fit for sites that are too polluted for housing or other types of development, noted Curran. Under the terms of the Superfund remediation, residential use is prohibited at the Yeoman Creek site.\n\nBut installing arrays on landfills or other remediated areas does entail some challenges.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reviews solar developers’ plans for Superfund sites, Curran said, to be sure the construction won’t damage caps over contaminated soil or otherwise release pollutants. The EPA examines ​“every single step of construction, from how big ballasts can be to stormwater protection to how we’re going to revegetate,” he added.\n\nEven mowing the grass below solar panels — a normally mundane process — can pose risks when a landfill lies underneath.\n\n“The lawn is basically what’s holding the land in place, so you don’t get erosion,” Curran said.\n\nAn Illinois law passed in October and awaiting the governor’s signature creates a rebate for community solar paired with battery storage. Curran said that batteries would likely be too heavy to locate on a landfill, but CleanCapital may explore putting them on firmer ground nearby.\n\nThe company has developed solar on brownfields and landfills in other states, including a new 822-kilowatt site in Maryland. Curran said community solar should be built on more of the nation’s thousands of closed landfills.\n\nPolicies like those in Illinois help facilitate the process. A 2017 law created robust incentives for community solar. Since then, more than 700 community solar projects totaling over 1,800 megawatts have been built through the Illinois Shines incentive program. Another 33 projects representing 64 megawatts have been subsidized by Illinois Solar for All, a program for low-income and environmental justice areas (separate from the federal program of the same name that was ended by the Trump administration).\n\nThe Illinois Power Agency, which acquires power on behalf of utilities, procures solar built on brownfields. The Illinois EPA also provides low-interest loans and other resources for brownfield redevelopment.\n\nA shared resource\n\nAmador found out about Yeoman Solar from local clean energy leaders after he helped launch a Waukegan branch of the Chicago Workers Collaborative, which organizes and advocates for temporary workers. (He is no longer with the group, though he still lives in Waukegan.)\n\nCommunity solar makes clean energy accessible to people who can’t or don’t want to install solar on their own homes — like Amador himself.\n\n“I live in a condo building, and if I bought a house I probably would not have solar panels. I don’t like how they look on rooftops,” he said.\n\nHe often gets the same reaction when he tells people about community solar. ​“At first they think I’m talking about installing solar on their homes — they don’t want that.”\n\nBut after explaining and extolling the community solar model, Amador has recruited dozens of family, friends, and members of his church to subscribe to Yeoman Solar.\n\n“It will help their wallet and help the ecosystem too,” Amador said.\n\nThe Yeoman Solar subscriptions will cover more than 90 percent of a household’s energy needs, said Ryan Libby, director of subscriber acquisition for PowerMarket, which CleanCapital contracted to recruit subscribers. Amador expects to save about $300 a year through his subscription, which equates to about 5 kilowatts of solar panels.\n\n“That money can pay for utilities, for food, for other bills,” Amador said. ​“With how bad this economy is, it’s an important impact.”\n\nYeoman Solar is the largest community solar array in the territory of ComEd, the utility that serves northern Illinois. It reduces the amount of energy the utility needs to provide, and ComEd has praised the project. While any ComEd customer can subscribe, Curran said CleanCapital is prioritizing outreach to Waukegan residents.\n\nAmador indeed feels it represents a new path for the city.\n\n“All the pollution, the coal plant, the disinvestment — communities like Waukegan should be prioritized for projects like this,” he said. ​“I’d like to encourage people to ask questions — go to meetings, find out how these projects work, try to sign up. That will help them to save some money, and if we all participate, we’re stronger.”",

      "summary": "Scientists have identified a brand-new species of worm living in the Great Salt Lake, marking only the third known animal group able to survive its extreme salinity. The species, named Diplolaimelloides woaabi with guidance from Indigenous elders, appears to exist only in this lake. How it got there remains a mystery, with theories ranging from ancient oceans to birds transporting it across continents. The discovery could help scientists track the lake’s health as conditions rapidly change.",
      "content": "Scientists studying the Great Salt Lake have identified at least one species of nematode that is completely new to science, with evidence suggesting there may be a second. Researchers from the University of Utah recently published a paper describing the tiny roundworm and formally naming it in a way that honors the Indigenous people whose ancestral lands include the lake.\n\nThe species has been named Diplolaimelloides woaabi and appears to live only in the Great Salt Lake. That makes it endemic to the lake and potentially an important, though still poorly understood, part of its ecosystem. To choose the name, the research team, led by University of Utah biology professor Michael Werner, worked with the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation. Tribal elders suggested Wo'aabi, an Indigenous word meaning \"worm.\"\n\nWhy Nematodes Matter\n\nNematodes are among the most widespread animals on Earth. They are found in nearly every environment imaginable, including polar ice, deep-sea hydrothermal vents and ordinary backyard soil. Most are smaller than a millimeter, which is why they often go unnoticed.\n\nDespite their size, nematodes are extraordinarily abundant. Scientists have identified more than 250,000 species so far, making them the most numerous animal phylum in both land and water ecosystems. Roughly 80% of animal life in terrestrial soils and about 90% of animals living on the ocean floor are nematodes.\n\nThe First Discovery in the Lake\n\nUntil recently, no nematodes had been definitively documented in the Great Salt Lake. That changed in 2022, when field expeditions led by Julie Jung uncovered nematodes living in the lake's microbialites. These are hardened, mound-like structures formed by microbial communities on the lakebed.\n\nJung, who was a postdoctoral researcher in Werner's lab at the time, collected samples while traveling across the lake by kayak and bicycle. The team reported that initial discovery in a scientific paper published last year.\n\n\"We thought that this was probably a new species of nematode from the beginning, but it took three years of additional work to taxonomically confirm that suspicion,\" said Jung, now an assistant professor at Weber State University.\n\nOnly the Third Animal Known to Survive There\n\nWith this finding, nematodes became just the third group of animals known to live in the Great Salt Lake's extremely salty water. The other two are brine shrimp and brine flies, which are crucial food sources for millions of migratory birds that stop at the lake each year.\n\nFurther research suggests the story may not be finished. Genetic evidence indicates there could be a second, previously unknown nematode species among the samples collected. Thomas Murray, an undergraduate researcher and second author on the paper, has been helping sample different regions of the lake to investigate this possibility.\n\n\"It's hard to tell distinguishing characteristics, but genetically we can see that there are at least two populations out there,\" Werner said.\n\nHow Did the Worms Get There?\n\nThe discovery raises two major questions for scientists. First, how did these worms arrive in the Great Salt Lake? Second, what role do they play in the lake's ecosystem?\n\nFrom early on, the team suspected the nematodes belonged to the family Monhysteridae. This is an ancient group of nematodes known for surviving in extreme conditions, including very salty environments. Genetic and physical analyses confirmed that the species belongs to the genus Diplolaimelloides, a group typically found in coastal marine and brackish waters.\n\nThat makes the Great Salt Lake discovery especially puzzling. Only one other member of this genus is known to live outside coastal regions, and that species is found in eastern Mongolia. The Great Salt Lake, by contrast, sits about 4,200 feet above sea level and is roughly 800 miles from the nearest ocean.\n\n\"That begs some more interesting, intriguing questions that you wouldn't have even known to think of until we figured out the alpha taxonomy,\" Werner said. \"There are two hypotheses, two models that are both kind of crazy for different reasons.\"\n\nAncient Seas or Traveling Birds\n\nOne explanation comes from coauthor Byron Adams, a nematologist and biology professor at Brigham Young University. He suggests the worms may have been living in the region for millions of years. During the Cretaceous Period, much of what is now Utah was located along the shoreline of a vast inland sea that split North America in two.\n\n\"So we were on the beach here. This area was part of that seaway, and streams and rivers that drained into that beach would be great habitat for these kinds of organisms,\" Adams said. \"With the Colorado Plateau lifting up, you formed a great basin, and these animals were trapped here. That's something that we have to test out and do more science on, but that's my go-to. The null hypothesis is that they're here because they've always kind of been here.\"\n\nWerner pointed out a major challenge to that idea. Northern Utah has not always been salty. Between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago, the region was covered by Lake Bonneville, a massive freshwater lake.\n\n\"If the nematode has been endemic since 100 million years ago, it has survived through these dramatic shifts in salinity at least once, probably a few times,\" he said.\n\nThe alternative explanation, which Werner admits is even \"crazier,\" is that the worms were transported by migratory birds. In this scenario, nematodes could have clung to feathers after birds visited saline lakes in South America and were then carried thousands of miles north.\n\n\"So who knows. Maybe the birds are transporting small invertebrates, including nematodes, across huge distances,\" Werner said. \"Kind of hard to believe, but it seems like it has to be one of those two.\"\n\nA Potential Early Warning for Lake Health\n\nBack in the lab, researchers noticed another unexpected pattern. Female nematodes were far more common than males in samples collected directly from the lake.\n\n\"That's another confusing part of the story for us. When we sample out there on the lake and bring them back in the lab, we get less than 1% males. But when we have cultured them in the lab, the males make up about 50% of the sex ratio,\" Werner said. \"We're super happy to be able to culture them in the lab, but there's something about it that's clearly different than the lake environment.\"\n\nThe worms live within algal mats that coat the lake's microbialites, feeding on bacteria that thrive there. Researchers found that the nematodes are concentrated in just the top few centimeters of these mats and are absent below that layer.\n\nWhile scientists are still determining their exact position in the food web, nematodes are known to be ecologically important in many environments. Their presence in the Great Salt Lake suggests they likely play a meaningful role there as well.\n\nNematodes are also widely used as bioindicators. Changes in their populations, diversity or distribution can signal shifts in water quality, salinity or sediment chemistry. With the Great Salt Lake under increasing pressure from human activity, this newly identified species could become a valuable tool for monitoring environmental change.\n\n\"When you only have a handful of species that can persist in environments like that, and they're really sensitive to change, those serve as really good sentinel taxa,\" Adams said. \"They tell you how healthy is your ecosystem.\"\n\nBecause Diplolaimelloides woaabi appears to live exclusively on microbialites, it may have unique relationships with microbes or unusual survival strategies that scientists have yet to uncover. Since microbialites play a central role in producing energy and supporting life in the lake, any interactions involving these nematodes could have effects that spread throughout the ecosystem.\n\nStudy Details and Funding\n\nThe research appears in the November 2025 issue of the Journal of Nematology under the title, \"Diplolaimelloides woaabi sp. n. (Nematoda: Monhysteridae): A Novel Species of Free-Living Nematode from the Great Salt Lake, Utah.\"\n\nThe study's authors include Solinus Farrer, Abigail Borgmeier and Byron J. Adams of Brigham Young University; Jon Wang and Morgan Marcus of the University of Utah; Gustavo Fonseca of the Federal University of São Paulo; and Thomas Powers of the University of Nebraska. Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health, the Society of Systematic Biologists, the National Science Foundation and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico.",
