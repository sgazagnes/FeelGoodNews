      "summary": "Scientists found that certain molecules made by gut bacteria travel to the liver and help control how the body uses energy. These molecules change depending on diet, genetics, and shifts in the microbiome. Some even improved insulin response in liver cells when tested in the lab. The findings could open the door to new ways of preventing or managing obesity and diabetes.",
      "content": "A research project supported by FAPESP and carried out at Harvard University in the United States has identified a set of metabolites that move from the intestine to the liver and then on to the heart, which distributes them throughout the body. These circulating compounds appear to influence how metabolic pathways function within the liver and how sensitive the body is to insulin. The findings point to potential new strategies for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. The study was published in Cell Metabolism.\n\n\"The hepatic portal vein drains much of the blood from the intestine to the liver. Therefore, it's the first place to receive products from the gut microbiome. In the liver, they can be conjugated, transformed, or eliminated, and then enter the systemic circulation,\" explains Vitor Rosetto Muñoz, first author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at the Ribeirão Preto School of Physical Education and Sports at the University of São Paulo (EEFERP-USP) in Brazil.\n\n\"By analyzing the blood leaving the intestine and the peripheral blood circulating throughout the body, we were able to more accurately observe the enrichment of these metabolites derived from the gut microbiome in each location and, consequently, how they can modify hepatic metabolism and metabolic health,\" adds Muñoz. He completed this work during an internship at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School in the United States with support from a FAPESP scholarship under the guidance of researcher Carl Ronald Kahn.\n\nGut Microbiome Diversity and Metabolic Disease Risk\n\nOver the past several years, scientists have increasingly recognized that the gut microbiome acts as a key link between genetics, environmental factors, and the development of metabolic disorders. Studies have shown that people and animals with obesity, type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance, or insulin resistance often have distinct gut microbial compositions compared to those without these conditions.\n\nEven so, researchers still struggle to determine which specific bacteria or microbial products drive these differences or how they interact with intestinal tissues. To explore this question, the recently published study examined metabolites in the blood of mice that varied in their susceptibility to obesity and diabetes. Samples were taken from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the intestine to the liver, and from peripheral blood, which travels from the liver to the heart before circulating through the body.\n\n\"Normally, studies tend to look at metabolites present in fecal material or peripheral blood, but they don't accurately reflect what's first reaching the tissue of the liver, which is an important metabolic organ linked to different diseases,\" says the researcher.\n\nEnvironmental and Genetic Effects on Metabolite Profiles\n\nIn healthy mice, the team detected 111 metabolites enriched in the hepatic portal vein and 74 in peripheral blood. When mice genetically predisposed to obesity and type 2 diabetes were fed a hyperlipidemic diet (rich in fat), the number of metabolites enriched in the hepatic portal vein dropped from 111 to 48. This finding indicates that environmental factors, such as diet, can strongly influence the distribution of these compounds.\n\nThe metabolite profiles in these susceptible mice also differed from those observed in a strain of mice naturally resistant to metabolic syndrome. This contrast suggests that genetic background plays a central role in shaping which metabolites appear in the hepatic portal vein.\n\n\"This shows that both the environment and the host's genetics can interact in complex ways with the gut microbiome. As a result of these interactions, different combinations of metabolites may be sent to the liver and subsequently to the peripheral circulation. These metabolites likely play an important role in mediating the conditions that lead to obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome,\" says Muñoz.\n\nTesting Microbiome Disruption and Metabolite Effects\n\nTo identify which bacteria and microbial byproducts contribute to these metabolite patterns, the researchers treated obesity and diabetes susceptible mice with an antibiotic designed to target specific intestinal microorganisms. As expected, the treatment altered the microbiome and changed the balance of metabolites in both peripheral blood and the hepatic portal vein.\n\nOne outcome was an increase in metabolites such as mesaconate, which participates in the Krebs cycle, a fundamental energy-producing pathway in cells.\n\nUsing this insight, the scientists exposed hepatocytes (liver cells) to mesaconate and its isomers, which are chemical compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. The treatments improved insulin signaling and regulated genes involved in hepatic fat accumulation (lipogenesis) and fatty acid oxidation, both of which are crucial processes for maintaining metabolic health.\n\n\"The metabolites found in the blood of these two sites, therefore, play important roles in mediating the effects of the microbiome on liver metabolism and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes insulin resistance, which is related to eating a high-fat diet,\" says Muñoz.\n\nNext Steps in Mapping Gut Driven Metabolic Pathways\n\nThe scientists now aim to characterize each metabolite in greater detail and determine how they are produced. This deeper understanding of microbial influences on metabolism may eventually lead to the identification of molecules that could serve as new therapeutic options for metabolic diseases.",

      "summary": "Senescent “zombie” cells are linked to aging and multiple diseases, but spotting them in living tissue has been notoriously difficult. Researchers at Mayo Clinic have now taken an inventive leap by using aptamers—tiny, shape-shifting DNA molecules—to selectively tag these elusive cells. The project began as an offbeat conversation between two graduate students and quickly evolved into a collaborative, cross-lab effort that uncovered aptamers capable of binding to unique surface proteins on senescent cells.",
      "content": "One potential strategy for treating a wide range of illnesses involves targeting senescent cells. These cells -- also known as \"zombie cells\" -- stop multiplying but fail to clear themselves from the body as healthy cells normally do. They appear in many conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and throughout the aging process. Although scientists are working on ways to eliminate or repair these cells, a major challenge has been detecting them within living tissue without disturbing nearby healthy cells.\n\nResearchers at Mayo Clinic, writing in the journal Aging Cell, describe a new method for labeling senescent cells. Their approach uses \"aptamers\" -- short pieces of synthetic DNA that fold into three-dimensional structures. These structures can attach to proteins found on the outer surfaces of cells. In experiments with mouse cells, the team identified several rare aptamers, selected from more than 100 trillion random DNA sequences, that were able to recognize specific surface proteins and mark senescent cells.\n\n\"This approach established the principle that aptamers are a technology that can be used to distinguish senescent cells from healthy ones,\" says biochemist and molecular biologist Jim Maher, III, Ph.D., a principal investigator of the study. \"Though this study is a first step, the results suggest the approach could eventually apply to human cells.\"\n\nHow a Chance Conversation Sparked a Collaboration\n\nThe idea that led to this project began when a Mayo Clinic graduate student shared an offbeat thought during a casual discussion with a classmate.\n\nKeenan Pearson, Ph.D. -- who recently received his degree from Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences -- had been working with Dr. Maher on how aptamers might be used for neurodegenerative diseases or brain cancer.\n\nMeanwhile, several floors above, fellow graduate student Sarah Jachim, Ph.D., was studying senescent cells and aging in the lab of researcher Nathan LeBrasseur, Ph.D.\n\nTheir paths crossed at a scientific gathering, where they exchanged ideas about their thesis projects. Dr. Pearson wondered if aptamers could be adapted to detect senescent cells. \"I thought the idea was a good one, but I didn't know about the process of preparing senescent cells to test them, and that was Sarah's expertise,\" says Dr. Pearson, who became lead author of the publication.\n\nMentors Back a Bold Student Idea\n\nThe students brought their concept to their advisors and to researcher Darren Baker, Ph.D., whose work centers on senescent cell therapies. Dr. Maher recalls that the idea initially struck him as \"crazy\" but worth exploring. All three mentors supported the proposal. \"We frankly loved that it was the students' idea and a real synergy of two research areas,\" says Dr. Maher.\n\nAs early experiments produced promising results, the pair enlisted more students from their labs. Then-graduate students Brandon Wilbanks, Ph.D., Luis Prieto, Ph.D., and M.D.-Ph.D. student Caroline Doherty added new techniques, including advanced microscopy and additional tissue types. \"It became encouraging to expend more effort,\" Dr. Jachim says, \"because we could tell it was a project that was going to succeed.\"\n\nRevealing New Clues About Senescent Cells\n\nBeyond providing a tagging method, the research offered insight into the biology of senescent cells. \"To date, there aren't universal markers that characterize senescent cells,\" says Dr. Maher. \"Our study was set up to be open-ended about the target surface molecules on senescent cells. The beauty of this approach is that we let the aptamers choose the molecules to bind to.\"\n\nThe team found that several aptamers attached to a variant of a protein called fibronectin on the surface of mouse cells. Scientists do not yet know how this fibronectin variant relates to senescence. However, its discovery suggests that aptamers may help identify features unique to senescent cells.\n\nPotential Applications for Human Health\n\nMore work will be needed to find aptamers that can reliably detect senescent cells in human tissue. If aptamers can be adapted for this purpose, they could eventually be used to deliver treatments directly to these cells. Dr. Pearson notes that aptamers are less costly and more flexible than traditional antibodies, which are commonly used to distinguish one cell type from another.\n\n\"This project demonstrated a novel concept,\" says Dr. Maher. \"Future studies may extend the approach to applications related to senescent cells in human disease.\"",

      "content": "Forskolin, a plant-derived compound, may offer a meaningful improvement in therapies for a highly aggressive leukemia known as KMT2A-rearranged Acute Myeloid Leukemia (KMT2A-r AML). Researchers at the University of Surrey report that this natural molecule could play a valuable role in enhancing patient outcomes.\n\nAccording to findings published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, forskolin not only slows the growth of leukemia cells but also increases how well chemotherapy drugs work. The Surrey team discovered that forskolin activates Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and reduces the activity of several cancer-linked genes (MYC, HOXA9 and HOXA10).\n\nNatural Compound Greatly Improves Chemo Sensitivity\n\nThe study also identified a notable and unexpected effect. Forskolin made KMT2A-r AML cells far more responsive to daunorubicin, which is a standard chemotherapy option. This improvement did not rely on PP2A activation. Instead, forskolin appeared to interfere with P-glycoprotein 1, a protein that cancer cells use to remove chemotherapy drugs. By limiting the function of P-glycoprotein 1, more daunorubicin remained inside the leukemia cells, increasing the strength of the treatment.\n\nDr. Maria Teresa Esposito, Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry at the University of Surrey, said:\n\n\"Our findings have highlighted an exciting dual mechanism of action for forskolin. Not only does it have direct anti-leukemic effects, but it also acts as a powerful enhancer to conventional chemotherapy. Combining forskolin with daunorubicin could lead to a more effective treatment strategy, potentially allowing for lower doses of chemotherapy and reducing the severe side effects often associated with AML treatments.\"\n\nDr. Simon Ridley, Director of Research and Advocacy at Leukemia UK, says:\n\n\"We are committed to funding innovative research and are proud to have supported Dr. Esposito's work. AML is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancer types, and this study not only deepens our understanding of KMT2A-rearranged AML but also opens the door to kinder, more effective treatments. Work like this is essential if we are to achieve our goal of doubling the five-year survival rate for AML within the next decade.\"\n\nLarge Research Collaboration Supports Findings\n\nThe work was funded by Leukaemia UK and carried out through a broad collaboration involving scientists at the University of Surrey, University of Roehampton, Barts Cancer Institute-Queen Mary University of London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health London- UCL and the Genomic Regulation, CRG Barcelona (Spain).",

Improving children’s nutrition is among the government’s top three priorities and a cornerstone of the new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework in the Asian island nation, which is expected to be signed in coming weeks and implemented in the 2026-2030 period.\n\nThe UN-supported school feeding programme benefits over 70,000 children across the country, while strengthening government capacity in nutrition, ensuring long-term sustainability.\n\nThe Government has made school feeding a national priority, decentralizing its management and funding to municipalities.\n\nWhile this approach promotes local ownership and the inclusion of home-grown produce, challenges remain in diversifying diets and guaranteeing consistent access to locally grown foods.\n\n© WFP/Isabel Pereira A farmer grows produce for school meal programmes in Timor-Leste.\n\nTo bridge these gaps, the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) are working alongside national and local authorities to strengthen menus and supply chains, improve kitchen infrastructure, and train school staff on nutrition and hygiene, in support of the government’s vision of linking nutrition, education and local economic development for long-term sustainability.\n\nStew and beans\n\nOn a recent Monday, the menu at the Same school consisted of deer stew, vegetables and brown rice, all served on stainless steel trays provided by the Ministry of Education with support from WFP.\n\nWFP also advised authorities on creating balanced meal plans using local ingredients and is helping to build a modern kitchen on the school grounds.\n\nIn Betano, where the children on the same Monday enjoyed chicken satay skewers with spinach, accompanied by rice and beans, FAO provided kitchen equipment. WFP provided training on budget management, school menu preparation, and kitchen hygiene.\n\n“The students eat everything, and that is great to see,” said Imana Imaculada Fernandes, the head cook at the Same school. “The meal plans – developed on the advice of the government and WFP – include 75 per cent local produce.”\n\nMs Fernandes and her team can spend 35 US cents per day per child and an additional 7 cents for other costs, such as fuel and labour. “That is 70 per cent more than we had before – and that translates into more nutritious food and improved hygiene”.\n\nEat what you grow\n\nThe initiative also brings steady income to local farmers. Andre Pereira de Sousa and his neighbours on the outskirts of Betano have seen stable demand for their tomatoes, watermelon, sweet potatoes and bananas.\n\n“The biggest advantage is that we no longer spend time and use fuel going to the market,” he said. “We can use that time to improve our farms and spend more time with our families.” Stable demand has also reduced food waste and encouraged farmers to increase production.\n\nThe Betano farmers supplying the schools were among the 9,000 households who have benefitted from an FAO programme on conservation agriculture.\n\nAs a result, they have diversified into higher value crops and now use compost rather than fertilizer, reducing costs and the environmental impact of their farms. The farmers’ group also received small mills to produce flour and prepare snacks for sale, along with a trailer to transport their produce.\n\nA united approach\n\nThe coordinated work of FAO and WFP exemplifies an approach increasingly adopted by the United Nations, where agencies work in complementary ways to support the government.\n\n“This is a great example when one plus one equals more than two, re-enforcing benefits for greater sustainability of projects,” said Funmi Balogun Alexander, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Timor-Leste. “The new Cooperation Framework between Timor-Leste and the UN is built around such joint approaches.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In Timor-Leste, a country where many families struggle to afford healthy food, children often miss out on nutritious meals. Nearly half of young children suffer from poor growth due to lack of good nutrition. The government, with help from the United Nations, wants to change this.\n\n**What happened** – Schools in Timor-Leste now provide free, healthy meals to over 70,000 children every day. These meals include protein, vegetables, and grains, made mostly from local farm products. Two UN groups, the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), help by training cooks, improving kitchens, and supporting farmers who supply the food.\n\n**Impact** – Children eating these meals are more focused in class and receive better nutrition than before. At the same time, local farmers benefit from steady demand for their crops, saving time and money while reducing waste. This connection helps the community by improving both education and farming.\n\n**What's next step** – The government plans to keep expanding and managing the program with local towns to make it sustainable. With ongoing UN support, the goal is to improve diets further, strengthen supply chains, and link nutrition to education and economic growth across the country.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Timor-Leste’s school meal program uses locally grown food to boost children’s nutrition and learning while supporting farmers and local communities.\n",

Près de la moitié des jeunes enfants souffrent d’un retard de croissance lié à une mauvaise alimentation. Le gouvernement, aidé par les Nations Unies, veut changer cette situation.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Plus de 70 000 enfants reçoivent désormais chaque jour des repas gratuits et sains à l’école. Ces repas contiennent des protéines, des légumes et des céréales, principalement issus des agriculteurs locaux. Deux agences de l’ONU, le Programme alimentaire mondial (PAM) et l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour l’alimentation et l’agriculture (FAO), aident en formant les cuisiniers, en améliorant les cuisines et en soutenant les agriculteurs fournisseurs.\n\n**Impact** – Les enfants qui mangent ces repas sont plus attentifs en classe et mieux nourris. En même temps, les agriculteurs locaux bénéficient d’une demande régulière pour leurs produits, ce qui leur fait économiser du temps et de l’argent tout en réduisant le gaspillage. Ce lien améliore à la fois l’éducation et l’agriculture dans la communauté.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – Le gouvernement prévoit d’étendre et de gérer ce programme avec les municipalités pour assurer sa durabilité. Avec le soutien continu de l’ONU, l’objectif est d’améliorer encore les régimes alimentaires, de renforcer les chaînes d’approvisionnement et de relier nutrition, éducation et développement économique à travers le pays.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – Le programme de repas scolaires du Timor-Leste utilise des aliments locaux pour améliorer la nutrition et l’apprentissage des enfants tout en soutenant les agriculteurs et les communautés locales.\n",
