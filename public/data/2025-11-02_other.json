      "content": "Military homes to be renovated in £9bn government plan\n\nIn 2022, dozens of members and their families told the BBC they were having to live in damp, mould-infested housing without heating.\n\nThe plan is in response to consistent complaints from serving personnel about the state of their accommodation.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence's new housing strategy will see improvements made to almost all of its 47,700 homes for military families in what Defence Secretary John Healey said will be the \"biggest renewal of Armed Forces housing in more than 50 years\".\n\nThousands of military homes across the UK will be modernised, refurbished or rebuilt over the next decade under a £9bn government plan to improve defence housing.\n\nA Commons defence committee last year found two-thirds of homes for service families needed \"extensive refurbishment or rebuilding\" to meet modern standards.\n\nUnder the new strategy, service family accommodation (SFA) will be refurbished with new kitchens, bathrooms and heating systems.\n\nAbout 14,000 will receive either \"substantial refurbishment\" or be completely replaced.\n\nThe plans are part of the government's wider defence housing strategy, to be published on Monday. A total of £4bn in funding to tackle the housing problem had already been announced.\n\nThe government says it has also identified surplus MoD land which could be used to build 100,000 new homes for civilian and military families.\n\nHealey said: \"This is a new chapter - a decisive break from decades of underinvestment, with a building programme to back Britain's military families and drive economic growth across the country.\"\n\nAlmost three years ago, the BBC was contacted by families in military accommodation in Sandhurst who had been living without heating for days.\n\n\"We're at breaking point and something has to change. The system is broken,\" they said at the time.\n\nIn response to the story, the MoD said it was working with its contractors to improve the service. But a report released in December last year found those problems \"still exist\".\n\n\"It is shocking that until a policy change in 2022, it was considered acceptable to house families in properties known to have damp and mould,\" the report said.\n\nThe MoD last year announced it would acquire 36,347 military houses from property company Annington Homes for nearly £6bn, reversing a privatisation deal struck in 1996 under the Conservative government.\n\nThe deal would save millions in rent and maintenance costs, the MoD said, money that would be put towards fixing military accommodation.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Military families in the UK have faced poor housing conditions, including damp, mould, and lack of heating. Complaints have been ongoing for years, with many homes needing major repairs.\n\n**What happened** – The UK government announced a £9 billion plan to renovate or rebuild almost all 47,700 military family homes over the next ten years. This includes upgrading kitchens, bathrooms, and heating systems. Around 14,000 homes will get major refurbishments or be completely replaced. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) also bought back thousands of military houses from a private company to save costs.\n\n**Impact** – This is the largest update to Armed Forces housing in over 50 years. It will improve living conditions for thousands of military families who have suffered in poor homes. The plan also helps reduce rent and maintenance costs by owning the homes directly. It shows a clear commitment to supporting military personnel and their families.\n\n**What's next step** – The government will publish its full defence housing strategy soon. Work will begin on renovating and rebuilding homes, and unused MoD land could be used to build 100,000 new homes for military and civilian families.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The UK government is investing £9 billion to fix and improve nearly all military family homes, ending decades of poor housing conditions.\n",

      "content": "Egypt's Grand Museum opens, displaying Tutankhamun tomb in full for first time\n\n10 hours ago Share Save Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent, in Cairo, and Wael Hussein, in Cairo Share Save\n\nGetty Images The new museum will show all of the artefacts discovered by Howard Carter and his team in the tomb of Tutankhamun\n\nNear one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World - the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza - Egypt has officially opened what it intends as a cultural highlight of the modern age. The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), described as the world's largest archaeological museum, is packed with some 100,000 artefacts covering some seven millennia of the country's history from pre-dynastic times to the Greek and Roman eras. Prominent Egyptologists argue that its establishment strengthens their demand for key Egyptian antiquities held in other countries to be returned – including the famed Rosetta Stone displayed at the British Museum. A main draw of the GEM will be the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun, displayed together for the first time since it was found by British Egyptologist Howard Carter. They include Tutankhamun's spectacular gold mask, throne and chariots.\n\nWatch: Pharaoh drone display and fireworks mark opening of Egypt's Grand Museum\n\nReuters The museum is packed with some 100,000 artefacts, including a statue of King Ramses II\n\n\"I had to think, how can we show him in a different way, because since the discovery of the tomb in 1922, about 1,800 pieces from a total of over 5,500 that were inside the tomb were on display,\" says Dr Tarek Tawfik, president of the International Association of Egyptologists and former head of the GEM. \"I had the idea of displaying the complete tomb, which means nothing remains in storage, nothing remains in other museums, and you get to have the complete experience, the way Howard Carter had it over a hundred years ago.\" Costing some $1.2bn (£910m; €1.1bn), the vast museum complex is expected to attract up to 8m visitors a year, giving a huge boost to Egyptian tourism which has been hit by regional crises. \"We hope the Grand Egyptian Museum will usher in a new golden age of Egyptology and cultural tourism,\" says Ahmed Seddik, a guide and aspiring Egyptologist by the pyramids on the Giza Plateau. Apart from the Tutankhamun exhibit and a new display of the spectacular, 4,500-year-old funerary boat of Khufu - one of the oldest and best-preserved vessels from antiquity - most of the galleries at the site have been opened to the public since last year. \"I've been organising so many tours to the museum even though it was partially open,\" Ahmed continues. \"Now it will be at the pinnacle of its glory. When the Tutankhamun collection opens, then you can imagine the whole world will come back, because this is an iconic Pharoah, the most famous king of all antiquity.\" \"It's an absolute must-see,\" says Spanish tourist, Raúl, who is awaiting the full public opening on 4 November. \"We're just waiting to go and check out all of the Egyptian artefacts,\" says Sam from London, who is on an Egypt tour. \"It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nGetty Images The majority of the museum, including the Grand Staircase, has been open to the public since last year\n\nAnother British tourist says she previously saw the Tutankhamun exhibits on display at the neoclassical Egyptian Museum in bustling Tahrir Square. \"The old museum was pretty chaotic, and it was a bit confusing,\" she comments. \"Hopefully the Grand Museum will be a lot easier to take in and I think you will just get more out of it.\" The new museum is colossal, spanning 500,000 square metres (5.4m sq ft) – about the size of 70 football pitches. The exterior is covered in hieroglyphs and translucent alabaster cut into triangles with a pyramid shaped entrance. Among the GEM showstoppers are a 3,200-year-old, 16m-long suspended obelisk of the powerful pharaoh, Ramesses II, and his massive 11m-high statue. The imposing statue was moved from close to the Cairo railway station in 2006, in a complex operation in preparation for the new institution. A giant staircase is lined with the statues of other ancient kings and queens and on an upper floor a huge window offers a perfectly framed view of the Giza pyramids. The museum was first proposed in 1992, during the rule of President Hosni Mubarak, and construction began in 2005. It has now taken nearly as long to complete as the Great Pyramid, according to estimates.\n\nReuters The vast complex is expected to attract up to eight million visitors a year\n\nThe project was hit by financial crises, the 2011 Arab Spring – which deposed Mubarak and led to years of turmoil - the Covid-19 pandemic, and regional wars. \"It was my dream. I'm really happy to see this museum is finally opened!\" Dr Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former long-time minister of tourism and antiquities, tells the BBC. The veteran archaeologist says it shows that Egyptians are equals of foreign Egyptologists when it comes to excavations, preservation of monuments and curating museums. \"Now I want two things: number one, museums to stop buying stolen artefacts and number two, I need three objects to come back: the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum, the Zodiac from the Louvre and the Bust of Nefertiti from Berlin.\" Dr Hawass has set up online petitions – attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures – calling for all three items to be repatriated. The Rosetta Stone, found in 1799, provided the key to deciphering hieroglyphics. It was discovered by the French army and was seized by the British as war booty. A French team cut the Dendera Zodiac, an ancient Egyptian celestial map, from the Temple of Hathor in Upper Egypt in 1821. Egypt accuses German archaeologists of smuggling the colourfully painted bust of Nefertiti, wife of Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten, out of the country more than a century ago. \"We need the three objects to come as a good feeling from these three countries, as a gift, as Egypt gave the world many gifts,\" Dr Hawass says.\n\nGetty Images The Dendera Zodiac is currently in the Louvre but the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum has renewed calls for it to be returned",
