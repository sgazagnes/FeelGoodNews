      "title": "Scientists find a missing link between Epstein-Barr virus and multiple sclerosis",
      "summary": "New research suggests that Epstein-Barr virus may actively provoke the immune system in people with multiple sclerosis. Scientists found large buildups of virus-targeting immune cells in the nervous systems of MS patients, far more than in their blood. One viral gene was active only in people with MS, hinting at a direct role in the disease. The findings could help guide new approaches to treatment.",
      "content": "Researchers at UC San Francisco have identified new evidence that may help explain how Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) contributes to multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a long-term autoimmune condition that affects nearly one million people in the United States.\n\nThe findings were published Feb. 5 in Nature Immunology. The study shows that people with MS have higher levels of certain CD8+ \"killer\" T cells. These immune cells normally destroy infected or damaged cells. Some of the elevated killer T cells specifically respond to EBV, suggesting the virus may help set off the harmful immune activity seen in MS.\n\nFor years, scientists have known that EBV is closely linked to MS. The virus infects about 95% of adults and is found in nearly everyone who eventually develops the disease.\n\n\"Looking at these understudied CD8+ T cells connects a lot of different dots and gives us a new window on how EBV is likely contributing to this disease,\" said senior author Joe Sabatino, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of Neurology and a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.\n\nWhy the Immune System Attacks in MS\n\nMultiple sclerosis occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks myelin, the protective layer surrounding nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. Over time, this damage leads to worsening neurological problems.\n\nUntil now, much of MS research has centered on CD4+ T cells. These cells help organize immune responses but do not directly kill other cells. CD4+ T cells are easier to study in animal models, which has left CD8+ killer T cells less explored despite their potential importance.\n\nSabatino's team set out to study these killer T cells directly in people.\n\nComparing Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid\n\nThe researchers examined blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 13 individuals with MS or early signs of the disease. They also studied samples from five people without MS.\n\nTheir analysis focused on CD8+ T cells that recognized specific proteins found in these fluids. In participants without MS, these immune cells appeared in similar numbers in both the blood and CSF.\n\nThe pattern was very different in people with MS. In those patients, the protein recognizing CD8+ T cells were between 10 and 100 times more concentrated in the CSF than in the blood. This striking imbalance pointed to unusual immune activity inside the central nervous system.\n\nViral Activity Inside the Nervous System\n\nEBV itself was detected in the CSF of most participants, regardless of whether they had MS. Some EBV genes were active in these samples. One gene stood out because it was active only in people with MS. This finding suggests the gene may help drive the heightened immune response that defines the disease.\n\nThe results add to growing evidence that EBV plays a role in autoimmune illness. In addition to MS, the virus has been linked to lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and long COVID.\n\nPotential Paths Toward New Treatments\n\nBecause of the strong association between EBV and MS, some researchers have already started testing treatments that aim to target the virus directly.\n\n\"The big hope here is that if we can interfere with EBV, we can have a big effect, not just on MS but on other disorders, and improve the quality of life for many, many people,\" Sabatino said.\n\nAdditional UCSF authors on the study include Fumie Hayashi, Kristen Mittl, Ravi Dandekar, Josiah Gerdts, Ebtesam Hassan, Ryan D.

This combination points to an African population closely related to Homo antecessor and living near the evolutionary split between African and Eurasian human lineages. Why northwest Africa matters for human origins More than 30 years of Moroccan French research along the Casablanca coast have uncovered a remarkably well preserved cave site that was once used by carnivores. These discoveries underscore northwest Africa's central role in the early evolution of the genus Homo.\n\nPrecisely Dated Fossils From Coastal Morocco\n\nAn international team of scientists has analyzed newly identified hominin fossils from Thomas Quarry I (Casablanca, Morocco), offering one of the most securely dated snapshots of early human evolution in Africa. The research was led by Jean-Jacques Hublin (Collège de France & Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology), David Lefèvre (Université de Montpellier Paul Valéry), Giovanni Muttoni (Università degli Studi di Milano) and Abderrahim Mohib (Moroccan Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine, INSAP).\n\nThe fossils have been dated to 773,000 plus or minus 4,000 years ago using an exceptionally detailed magnetostratigraphic record. This record captures the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary, the most recent major reversal of Earth's magnetic field, which serves as a precise global time marker in the Quaternary period. Published in Nature, the study sheds new light on African populations that lived close to the evolutionary branch leading to Homo sapiens and helps clarify the shared ancestry of H. sapiens, Neanderthals, and Denisovans.\n\nDecades of Fieldwork Lead to a Breakthrough\n\nThe discoveries are the result of more than 30 years of sustained archaeological and geological research carried out under the Moroccan-French Program \"Préhistoire de Casablanca.\" This long-running collaboration has involved large-scale excavations, detailed stratigraphic analysis, and extensive geoarchaeological studies across the southwestern part of Casablanca.\n\nOver time, this careful work revealed the unusual quality of preservation at Thomas Quarry I, including its layered sediments, environmental record, and archaeological materials. These conditions ultimately led researchers to the hominin remains and the geological context that makes the current study possible.\n\nAs Abderrahim Mohib explains: \"The success of this long-term research reflects a strong institutional collaboration involving the Ministère de la Jeunesse, de la Culture et de la Communication Département de la Culture of the Kingdom of Morocco (through INSAP) and the Ministère de l'Europe et des Affaires Étrangères of France (through the French Archaeological Mission Casablanca).\" Additional support came from institutions in Italy, Germany, and France, including the Università degli Studi di Milano, the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, the LabEx Archimède -- University of Montpellier Paul Valéry, the University of Bordeaux, and the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nA Geological Hotspot for Human Prehistory\n\nThomas Quarry I sits within the raised coastal formations of the Rabat-Casablanca littoral, an area internationally recognized for its remarkably complete record of Plio-Pleistocene shorelines, dunes, and cave systems. According to Jean-Paul Raynal, who co-directed the program during the key excavation period, repeated changes in sea level, wind-driven sedimentation, and rapid cementation of coastal sands created ideal conditions for preserving fossils and archaeological evidence.\n\nThese processes turned the Casablanca region into one of Africa's most important archives of Pleistocene life. The area documents early Acheulean stone tool industries, shifting animal communities linked to climate change, and multiple phases of hominin presence over hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nThe Grotte à Hominidés and Its Exceptional Context\n\nExcavated within the Oulad Hamida Formation, Thomas Quarry I is already known for containing the oldest Acheulean tools in north-western Africa, dated to about 1.3 million years ago. The site is also close to Sidi Abderrahmane, a landmark locality for Middle Pleistocene archaeology in Northwest Africa.\n\nWithin this broader setting lies the \"Grotte à Hominidés,\" a cave system created during a marine highstand and later filled with sediments that remained undisturbed over time. David Lefèvre describes it as \"a unique cave system carved by a marine highstand into earlier coastal formations and later filled with sediments that preserved hominin fossils in a secure, undisturbed and undisputable stratigraphic context.\"\n\nLocking Fossils to a Moment in Time\n\nDetermining the age of Early and Middle Pleistocene fossils is often difficult because rock layers are incomplete or dating methods come with large uncertainties. The Grotte à Hominidés stands out because sediments accumulated rapidly and continuously, preserving an unusually detailed magnetic signal.\n\nEarth's magnetic field periodically flips polarity, and these reversals leave a clear and globally synchronized signature in sediments. The Matuyama-Brunhes transition (MBT), which occurred around 773,000 years ago, is the most recent major reversal and one of the most reliable chronological markers available. As Serena Perini explains: \"Seeing the Matuyama-Brunhes transition recorded with such resolution in the ThI-GH deposits allows us to anchor the presence of these hominins within an exceptionally precise chronological framework for the African Pleistocene.\"\n\nThe cave sequence records the end of the Matuyama Chron (reverse polarity), the MBT itself, and the beginning of the Brunhes Chron (normal polarity). By analyzing 180 magnetostratigraphic samples, an unprecedented number for a hominin site of this age, researchers pinpointed the exact position of the polarity switch at 773,000 years and captured its brief duration of 8,000 to 11,000 years. The hominin fossils were deposited during this narrow window, a conclusion further supported by animal remains found at the site.\n\nFossils Near the Base of the Human Family Tree\n\nThe human remains appear to come from what was once a carnivore den. Evidence includes a hominin femur marked by clear signs of gnawing. The assemblage consists of a nearly complete adult lower jaw, part of a second adult mandible, a child's mandible, several vertebrae, and isolated teeth.\n\nDetailed analyses using micro-CT scans, shape measurements, and anatomical comparisons reveal a mix of primitive and more derived features. Some traits resemble hominins from Gran Dolina in Atapuerca, often referred to as Homo antecessor, raising the possibility of very early population connections between north-west Africa and southern Europe. However, by the time of the Matuyama-Brunhes transition, these groups appear to have already diverged, suggesting any contact occurred earlier.\n\nWhat Teeth Reveal About Ancestry\n\nMatthew Skinner explains how internal tooth structures provided critical clues: \"Using microCT imaging we were able to study a hidden internal structure of the teeth, referred to as the enamel-dentine junction, which is known to be taxonomically informative and which is preserved in teeth where the enamel surface is worn away. Analysis of this structure consistently shows the Grotte à Hominidés hominins to be distinct from both Homo erectus and Homo antecessor, identifying them as representative of populations that could be basal to Homo sapiens and archaic Eurasian lineages.\"\n\nShara Bailey adds that the overall tooth shape supports this conclusion. \"In their shapes and non-metric traits, the teeth from Grotte à Hominidés retain many primitive features and lack the traits that are characteristic of Neanderthals. In this sense, they differ from Homo antecessor, which -- in some features -- are beginning to resemble Neanderthals. The dental morphological analyses indicate that regional differences in human populations may have been already present by the end of the Early Pleistocene.\"\n\nRethinking Africa's Role in Human Evolution\n\nThe findings reinforce the idea that Northwest Africa was a major center of early human evolution during periods when shifting climates opened migration routes across what is now the Sahara. As Denis Geraads notes: \"The idea that the Sahara was a permanent biogeographic barrier does not hold for this period. The palaeontological evidence shows repeated connections between Northwest Africa and the savannas of the East and South.\"\n\nThe Grotte à Hominidés hominins lived around the same time as those from Gran Dolina, earlier than Middle Pleistocene fossils linked to Neanderthals and Denisovans, and roughly 500,000 years before the earliest known Homo sapiens remains from Jebel Irhoud. Their combination of ancient African traits and features that foreshadow later Eurasian and African populations offers rare insight into the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, and Denisovans -- estimated from genetic evidence to have lived between 765,000 and 550,000 years ago. Fossil evidence from the Moroccan site aligns most closely with the earlier part of this range.\n\nJean-Jacques Hublin concludes that \"the fossils from the Grotte à Hominidés may be the best candidates we currently have for African populations lying near the root of this shared ancestry, thus reinforcing the view of a deep African origin for our species.\"",

      "summary": "New research suggests the astringent sensation caused by flavanols could act as a direct signal to the brain, triggering effects similar to a mild workout for the nervous system. In mouse experiments, flavanol intake boosted activity, curiosity, learning, and memory—despite these compounds barely entering the bloodstream. The key appears to be sensory stimulation: the taste itself activates brain pathways linked to attention, motivation, and stress response, lighting up regions involved in arousal and memory.",
      "content": "Astringency is the dry, puckering, rough, or sandpapery feeling people notice when eating foods rich in certain plant compounds called polyphenols. Polyphenols include flavanols, which have long been linked to lower cardiovascular disease risk. Flavanols are especially common in cocoa, red wine, and berries, and research has associated them with better memory, improved cognitive performance, and protection against damage to brain cells.\n\nHowever, flavanols present a scientific puzzle. Only a small portion of what people consume actually makes it into the bloodstream after digestion. This low bioavailability raises an important question: if so little is absorbed, how do flavanols still appear to influence brain function and the nervous system?\n\nA New Hypothesis Focused on Taste\n\nTo explore this mystery, researchers led by Dr. Yasuyuki Fujii and Professor Naomi Osakabe at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan turned their attention to sensory perception. Their study, published in Current Research in Food Science, examined whether the distinctive astringent taste of flavanols could itself act as a signal to the brain.\n\n\"Flavanols exhibit an astringent taste. We hypothesized that this taste serves as a stimulus, transmitting signals directly to the central nervous system (comprising the brain and spinal cord). As a result, it is thought that flavanol stimulation is transmitted via sensory nerves to activate the brain, subsequently inducing physiological responses in the periphery through the sympathetic nervous system,\" explains Dr. Fujii.\n\nTesting Flavanols in Animal Experiments\n\nThe team tested this idea using 10-week-old mice. The animals received oral doses of flavanols at 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg of body weight, while a control group was given distilled water. The mice that consumed flavanols showed noticeably higher levels of physical activity, increased exploration, and stronger performance in learning and memory tasks compared with the control group.\n\nBrain analysis revealed that flavanols boosted neurotransmitter activity in multiple regions. Shortly after administration, levels of dopamine and its precursor levodopa increased, along with norepinephrine and its metabolite normetanephrine in the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline network. These chemicals play key roles in motivation, attention, alertness, and stress regulation. The researchers also observed increased production of enzymes essential for norepinephrine synthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-β-hydroxylase) and transport (vesicular monoamine transporter 2), suggesting stronger signaling within this brain system.\n\nStress Pathways and Hormone Responses\n\nAdditional biochemical tests showed higher levels of catecholamines in urine, which are hormones released during stress, along with increased activity in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). This brain region is central to controlling stress responses. Flavanol intake also raised levels of c-Fos (a key transcription factor) and corticotropin-releasing hormone in the PVN, further indicating activation of stress-related brain pathways.\n\nEffects That Resemble Exercise\n\nWhen viewed together, the findings suggest that flavanols can trigger broad physiological responses similar to those produced by physical exercise. Rather than acting only through absorption into the bloodstream, flavanols appear to function as a moderate stressor that stimulates the central nervous system, leading to heightened attention, alertness, and memory.\n\n\"Stress responses elicited by flavanols in this study are similar to those elicited by physical exercise. Thus, moderate intake of flavanols, despite their poor bioavailability, can improve the health and quality of life,\" remarks Dr. Fujii.\n\nImplications for Sensory Nutrition\n\nThe results point to new possibilities in the emerging field of sensory nutrition. By focusing on how foods feel and stimulate the nervous system, researchers suggest it may be possible to design next-generation foods that combine appealing taste, beneficial physiological effects, and improved palatability.\n\nThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number 23H02166).",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les flavanols sont des composés naturels présents dans le cacao, le vin rouge et les baies. Ils sont liés à une meilleure mémoire et santé du cerveau. Mais les scientifiques s'interrogent sur leur fonctionnement, car peu de flavanols passent dans le sang après consommation.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Des chercheurs japonais ont testé si le goût sec et amer des flavanols, appelé astringence, envoie des signaux directs au cerveau. Chez des souris, ce goût a augmenté leur activité, curiosité et mémoire. Des substances chimiques du cerveau liées à l'attention et au stress ont aussi augmenté, même si les flavanols n'étaient presque pas absorbés.\n\n**Impact** – Cette étude montre que le goût des flavanols agit comme un léger exercice pour le cerveau. Au lieu d'être absorbés, ces signaux sensoriels activent des zones du cerveau responsables de l'alerte et de l'apprentissage. C'est une nouvelle façon dont la nourriture peut influencer le cerveau.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs pourraient développer des aliments qui améliorent le cerveau grâce au goût et aux sensations. Ils étudieront aussi si ces effets se produisent chez l'humain et comment cela peut aider à mieux apprendre ou mémoriser.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le goût sec et amer des flavanols stimule directement l'activité cérébrale et améliore la mémoire en activant des nerfs, sans passer par l'absorption dans le corps.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Los flavanoles son compuestos naturales que se encuentran en el cacao, el vino tinto y las bayas. Se han relacionado con una mejor memoria y salud cerebral. Pero los científicos se preguntaban cómo funcionan porque solo una pequeña parte llega al torrente sanguíneo.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigadores en Japón probaron si el sabor seco y amargo de los flavanoles, llamado astringencia, envía señales directas al cerebro. En ratones, este sabor aumentó su actividad, curiosidad y memoria. También subieron sustancias químicas del cerebro relacionadas con la atención y el estrés, aunque los flavanoles casi no se absorbieron.\n\n**Impacto** – Este estudio muestra que el sabor de los flavanoles funciona como un ejercicio suave para el cerebro. En lugar de ser absorbidos, el sabor activa nervios que despiertan áreas del cerebro para estar alerta y aprender. Es una forma nueva en que la comida puede afectar el cerebro.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos podrían crear alimentos que mejoren la función cerebral enfocándose en el sabor y la estimulación sensorial. También estudiarán si estos efectos ocurren en humanos y cómo podrían ayudar en el aprendizaje o la memoria.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – El sabor seco y amargo de los flavanoles puede estimular directamente la actividad cerebral y mejorar la memoria activando señales nerviosas, no solo a través de la absorción en el cuerpo.",
