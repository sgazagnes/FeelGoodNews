      "content": "Tough, smart and ahead of her time - how Dame Stephanie changed women's role in the tech industry\n\n16 hours ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman • @zsk Technology editor Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nTo many women in tech, myself included, Dame Stephanie Shirley, who has died aged 91, was inspirational. Her pioneering and controversial decision to hire exclusively women coders and data inputters, working from home, was way ahead of its time and changed many lives. She had a difficult life, and it made her tough. She was stoic about grief and showed - publicly at least - extraordinary strength in the face of a number of traumatic experiences. She was from a generation whose childhoods were shaped by the atrocities of World War 2. She died on 9 August, her family said in an Instagram post on Monday.\n\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nBorn Vera Buchthal in the German city of Dortmund in 1933, Dame Stephanie's Jewish father was a judge. He had hoped that being in a position of power would protect his family, but as the Nazi government increased its persecution of German Jews, they fled to the Austrian capital Vienna. She was one of thousands of Jewish children fleeing the Nazis and came to Britain aged five as part of the Kindertransport - a British rescue effort in the months preceding World War 2 which brought 10,000 children to the UK - where she was brought up by loving foster parents. She went on to become a computer industry and women's rights pioneer in the 1950s and 1960s. She founded the software company Freelance Programmers, which shook up the tech industry by almost exclusively hiring women, and in later life donated almost £70m to help those with autism and to IT projects. She was very smart and truly formidable, even adopting the name \"Steve\" to help her in a male-dominated tech world.\n\nDame Stephanie Shirley Dame Stephanie (left) and her sister, pictured with their German father and Austrian mother, who put them on a Kindertransport train to escape Nazi-occupied Austria\n\nDame Stephanie was determined not to be defined by her traumatic childhood. After starting out as a scientific civil servant, in 1962 she founded Freelance Programmers - later known as FI Group, later still Xansa - something which was almost unheard of for a woman to do in the 1960s. She designed the company to provide jobs for women with children. It changed the landscape for women working in technology by offering flexible working practices. Of the first 300 staff, 297 were female. The success of the company left Dame Stephanie with a fortune of about £150m, most of which she donated to good causes. Her late son Giles was autistic and she was an early member of the National Autistic Society, with her charity the Shirley Foundation funding many projects particularly related to autism. She founded Autism at Kingwood, a service which now supports autistic adults in Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. She also helped set up Prior's Court - a school for autistic young people in Thatcham, Berkshire.\n\nDame Stephanie Shirley Dame Stephanie was at the forefront of UK computing advances\n\n\"Steve was an absolute legend, and an incredible friend and role model for me over the last 30 years,\" Professor Sue Black told the BBC. \"Before the likes of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Shirley was innovating and solving problems with tech in the UK.\" And Dame Wendy Hall, one of the world's leading computer scientists, said Dame Stephenie had been \"inspirational\". \"She was my mentor and my friend and she will be hugely missed,\" she said. \"She did so much for the computer science community to encourage women into that community, and of course, for the world of autism.\"\n\nThe last time I saw her, I introduced her at an event on stage. She was frail, but as always extremely glamorous and totally captivating. She said she knew she was coming to the end of her life and she reflected candidly on what she felt she had learned. She had a strong moral compass and believed in using her wealth for good. And she never stopped standing up to sexism. She spent her whole life refusing to conform to society's many gender stereotypes and clichés. Much time has passed since Dame Stephanie started signing letters as Steve in order to get the attention of the male business contacts she was messaging. But Tech continues to be a male dominated industry and women still have to shout loud to be heard. Steve was one of the first, and she shouted the loudest.",

      "content": "Deborah Daley 00:06\n\nHello and welcome to Changemakers, a podcast series brought to you by Nature, where we shine a light on fascinating and extraordinary scientists.\n\nI’m Deborah Daley, global Chair of Springer Nature’s Black Employee Network, and I’m very proud to present this series, where we explore exclusion in science and how some researchers are doing something about it.\n\nIn episode six, we meet a US researcher who works tirelessly to bridge the Native American worldview with Western science.\n\nJoslynn Lee 00:50\n\nYá’át’ééh.\n\nMy name is Joslynn Lee. I am of the Diné (Navajo) and Keres-speaking Laguna-Acoma people, and I’m currently an associate professor of chemistry at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado. And I am really excited to bring my Indigenous values from my cultural upbringing into chemistry and STEM courses that I teach here.\n\nSo I grew up in New Mexico. And this wasn’t too far from where my dad grew up. He grew up in Shiprock, New Mexico, and that’s one of the larger towns on Navajo Nation.\n\nMy mom grew up in a little village of Mesita, which is part of Laguna Pueblo. But growing up not fully immersed on the reservation was where I missed being able to speak my Native languages and being what we call inter-tribal. So that’s being background from multiple tribal nations or Indigenous groups.\n\nSo that also brought more lived experiences that I think differ from a lot of other Indigenous folks.\n\nBut with that, I had a different perspective from my peers who grew up in the city and may not have had connections to their traditional upbringing.\n\nMy nálí. So this is what we call your paternal grandparents on your Navajo side. She was the first person who really got me into science, and she raised goats and would herd them in her younger days.\n\nNow she’s a little bit older that it’s hard for her to get out walking, so my parents would drop us off, and we would spend time with her, and we would also go sheep herding or goat herding with her.\n\nAnd along those experiences, I got to see the vast geology, and not really knowing the scientific terms, but just making observations.\n\nAnd I think when I reflect back on that, that is a key component as a scientist. So on these walks, we would look at various plants, and she would highlight which were medicinal or which were edible.\n\nAnd I think that experience really got me captivated by how we use plants, how we take care of them, how we talk to them.\n\nAnd then I would go back to school in the border town, where we really didn’t have that training. It was more of classification. This is a plant, and that’s it. There was not really a reciprocal understanding of it.\n\nSo I think early on in my perspective as a scientist, it was more battling the two worldviews that we didn’t really talk about as a family. It was more you kept them separate.\n\nIt wasn’t until I got to college that I was taking organic chemistry, and I had a really great professor here who was interested in how I could bridge some of my cultural background into organic chemistry.\n\nSo we had a natural dyes lab. And with that, I go back to the plants that my nálí, my grandmother, shared with me, and she took me out, and I was able to gather some plants, bring them back to the lab and look at some of the colouring, but also identify some of the molecules that were used on the medicinal side, both from literature, but also using some of our spectroscopy methods.\n\nSo that was really a unique space that I got excited, on how I could bring my whole self in science. And also, you know, think about the knowledge you share.\n\nBecause I had the discussion with my professor of like, “I can’t share where this plant is from, because I don’t want other people going through and gathering it, or studying it.”\n\nAnd, you know, I wanted to return stuff that wasn’t used in lab back home, because that’s sort of what we were taught culturally.\n\nSo that was my experience of thinking about my culture being Indigenous. And then you know what ways I could identify spaces in my college career.\n\nSo Fort Lewis College is a Native American-serving non-tribal institution. Thirty per cent of our student population identifies as Indigenous, Native American, Alaska Native.\n\nSo that designation is similar to a Hispanic-serving institution or minority-serving institution. But at the school, and why I chose to work here, was because of the higher population of Indigenous students.\n\nSo currently I teach our lower division general chemistry classes and upper division biochemistry courses. That’s my teaching portion.\n\nThe research side, because I’m an assistant professor, my group, we study microbes in various environments, specifically environmental.\n\nAnd one project we have is studying the microbial makeup of acid mine drainage.\n\nSo in the beautiful mountains around Durango in the early 1900s there’s been a lot of mining. And some of those mines have been abandoned and not fully cleaned up.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the federal government here has allocated money, but there are over 400 mines, so I’m interested in what are some of those unique microbes in those extreme conditions of low pH, and how they uptake different metals.\n\nSo that’s one avenue. Another is looking at that shift in the microbial makeup at some of those extreme conditions in rivers, and then how that moves down into New Mexico.\n\nSo following the Animas river that’s in Colorado, linking up to the San Juan river in New Mexico, and that San Juan river goes through Navajo Nation.\n\nSo there have been a lot of questions on, what is the health of our rivers? So that’s one thing. I’m trying to do more of a longitudinal study to identify impacts of some of this runoff that we get when we have freeze-thaw, because we get a lot of snow in the mountains up here. And what are the cycles? What are the shifts.\n\nDo we see more metals that are released? And then what do some of those microbes do? Do they uptake some of the metals, or as their sort of bio, natural bioremediation? Or do we need to be more careful in the cleanup of this?\n\nSo when I think about my values and knowledge system in my role currently, I think about growing up, being shown the land, sort of seeing my responsibility to take care of it.\n\nSo I think that aligns into why I do the research I do. I care about our water. I care about the plants because we rely on them.\n\nAnd even though I’m not in my exact traditional homelands, you know, we’re bordering them, where I’m at in Durango, Colorado, but just knowing the river ways are connected, so everything that happens in the mountains is what’s downstream water sources for where the desert is.\n\nAnd growing up, learning about how to think about taking care of other people, was also an embedded value for me.\n\nSo as I’m thinking of my role as a faculty member, thinking about who’s in my classroom, trying to build a community of support, but also empower the students who I’m teaching to see themselves as also the same position of they want to take care of Mother Earth, Father Sky.\n\nSo they’re here to get an education, to be able to go back to their own home communities and see how they can either advocate, do research to help answer questions, and also think about sustaining their language, their cultural practices.\n\nWhen I’m thinking about, you know, not just teaching chemistry, it’s also a group of students that have the same lived experience that I do.\n\nThat we all have this goal that it’s not…we’re just here to learn chemistry, to get a job, it’s much bigger than that.\n\nAnd trying to get other faculty to be aware of this. That these students, you know, may not came come from the best educational system, but they really want to have those final goals to help their families.\n\nThere are ways that I think about my learning, so I do a lot of storytelling or, like, talk about experiments on how people get to finding out knowledge, because that’s how I was raised, on how we know about spaces within our tribal communities and how we use land.\n\nBecause when I think about my Keres side, we don’t write down, it’s an oral tradition that’s passed. So you have to speak the language, practice ceremonies. And not growing up there. I don’t have all of the full understanding. On my Navajo side. You know, there is a written language.\n\nWe think about the Navajo code talkers also, so it’s been written down. But there are also oral stories that help us learn about concepts think about our ways of life.\n\nSo for me, when I’m thinking about instructing in the classroom, a lot of students who don’t come from that sort of upbringing don’t like the style as much of hearing about more of a story and coming back around to it.\n\nThat’s one thing I’ve seen in some of my student evaluation, is that I’m very long-winded in some areas, but we still do some hands on-activities, but it takes me maybe two to three lectures for them to finally get to like, \"Oh, we follow this full circle that you’re coming back to for a concept.\"\n\nAnd then another main worldview, it’s called hózhó. And this is for Navajo, that we try to see a balance in how we live our lives, and that’s sort of like our level we want to get to.\n\nSo as you’re progressing from a child to an elder, you have different lived experiences.\n\nBut the ultimate goal is to make sure you’re taking care of yourself, but your people around you, and also Mother Earth, and every decision that you make will get you to that direction.\n\nSo when we talk about our tribal elders, they’re the ones who have the knowledge, the experience, and they are trying to attain that level of their livelihood.\n\nAnd when I think about how I also rely on their knowledge, on not just my education, but just how you are as a human being.\n\nSo that’s one thing I think a lot of students would want more elders on campus, but we haven’t really figured out the best way that we could help that connection.\n\nSo there are different things I think I can do in the classroom, in research, and then having access for students to see that you can have your Indigenous values when you’re in academia.\n\nWhen we think about our traditional stories, a lot of these we see as gifts. And they’re also like beings.\n\nSo there’s a respect for, like, a plant. It’s not just like a plant to us. This is another living entity that, you know, we see in a different manner than people.\n\nSo whenever we have students who have to dissect or go and collect samples for class, like, it’s really tricky for them because a lot of them see them as, like, beings that, in our culture, we respect at a different level. And we have to make an offering.\n\nBut if you’re in a classroom, you’re going out collecting stuff, and you have to just, like, pick something up, but that’s not usually the manner you approach a plan. It can be very uneasy for a lot of students.\n\nSo we’ve talked about within our school, how do we balance that field collecting or even dissecting? Because some of the animals that we see in our Indigenous practices are protectors, and we shouldn’t harm them.\n\nOthers may have a taboo or bad perspective that we aren’t supposed to engage with them. So that’s another thing of like, how do you build an inclusive class that is mindful of cultural practices but provide some of the knowledge that you can gain from it.\n\nSo yeah, so microbes are an area I got into because I didn’t have to figure out how do I prepare students working with a cell line or something that comes from a human?\n\nBecause for us Navajo folks, we’re not supposed to touch things from another human or interact with it, because we don’t know what happened to that individual.\n\nSo working with human cells is really tricky. I think for a lot of indigenous folks. Some people may not be that traditional, so they don’t practice it. So that’s another nuance that we see.\n\nWe can’t assume everybody who’s Indigenous doesn’t have this. But how do we create that space to talk about it is one thing I’ve been learning being a faculty member.\n\nWhen we think about the word diversity, when I think about it in the context of science, it’s really the idea that you have different viewpoints.\n\nSo when I think about research questions that I’ve encountered in my graduate training, postdoc training, I don’t just focus on one thing. I see the interconnectedness and other areas we have to consider.\n\nMy Indigenous perspective is all the actions we have are going to have effects on other things.\n\nSo if we extract something from Mother Earth, in our perspective, we go back and either return it, or fix or update or modify to get it back to the most original state to avoid any repercussions happening.\n\nSo that’s one thing I always think about whenever I’m out in the field, is to have less impact. But when we’re looking at research questions in the lab, is just we can’t look at one thing on its own.\n\nWe can start with that, but you have to think about the interconnectedness to other entities within the cell if you’re looking at it.\n\nAs students have that reminder of just like, “Oh, even though we’re focusing on maybe one molecule, there is some connectedness to other organisms that we see.”\n\nSo we talk about antibiotics, like those come from bacteria. So it’s, I think, really cool to have that more worldview or whole perspective that can encourage people to think outside of the box or have more creativity.\n\nSo when I think about the idea of diversity in science and why it’s so crucial and different worldviews, it’s mostly that sort of reminder that not everyone is going to approach science in one way.\n\nDeborah Daley 18:33\n\nIn the next episode, we meet a Mexican American research leader who has turned mentoring into an evidence-based science.",

Those under 25 today will make up over 90 per cent of the global prime-age workforce by 2050.\n\nIn addition, an international survey of over 27,000 respondents in 26 countries on challenges faced by people in public lives revealed that 67 per cent believe in a better future, with 15 to 17-year-olds expressing the most optimism.\n\nDespite their immense potential for good, young people continue to face systemic challenges.\n\n© UNICEF/Siegfried Modola Young men from the Rohingya community receive electrician training at a refugee camp in southern Bangladesh.\n\nChronic job shortage\n\nYouth unemployment, although at a 15-year low, still stands at 13 per cent globally.\n\nAmong 10 to 19-year-olds, one in seven experience a mental health disorder. In low- and middle-income countries, nearly six in ten 10-year-olds cannot read and comprehend a simple paragraph.\n\nInternational Youth Day 2025 aims to highlight not only the urgency of these issues, but also the solutions already being forged by youth themselves – in their communities, cities and countries.\n\nAs Mr. Guterres emphasised: “Global progress begins in communities. And in every corner of the world, young people are leading the way.”\n\nNairobi to host global commemoration\n\nThis year’s official observance will take place in Nairobi, Kenya, organized in collaboration with UN-Habitat, the UN agency focused on sustainable urban development.\n\nTuesday’s event will bring together youth leaders, city officials, policymakers and UN officials to showcase solutions and strategies for strengthening youth engagement in local development.\n\nInternational Youth Day was first proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in 1999, building on the World Programme of Action for Youth adopted in 1995.",

      "summary": "Twenty-two Angika speakers and five language guardians joined a workshop in Bhagalpur, Bihar, India from April 28–29, 2025, to explore digital strategies for enhancing Angika’s online presence, organized by Rising Voices and Angika Wikimedians.",
      "content": "The online presence of a language is vital for promoting its usage in everyday life. This is something well understood by speakers of Angika, a language spoken in the Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nFollowing a call for participation by Angika Wikimedians and Rising Voices, Angika language speakers and supporters gathered in Bhagalpur, India, on April 28–29, 2025, to explore digital strategies for strengthening Angika's presence online. Guided by eight key strategies — facilitate, multiply, normalize, educate, reclaim, imagine, defend, and protect — Angika speaking participants learned about community-centered approaches to support and revitalize their language in the digital sphere.\n\nCreating a roadmap for digitizing Angika\n\nThe two-day workshop in Bhagalpur ran from 10 am to 4 pm each day. The event attracted significant interest, from which 22 participants were selected. In addition to the participants, five language guardians, including veteran Angika writers, were present throughout both days of the workshop.\n\nDay one began with participants introducing themselves. They discussed their connection to the Angika language and identity, and shared their motivations for supporting Angika. They also stressed the importance of speaking one’s language as a means of strengthening community bonds.\n\nAn interactive session on language rights followed, which prompted a range of responses from attendees. Participants ruminated over the decline of Angika as a preferred language for public communication, the lack of educational resources in Angika, and their desire to spearhead a shift in social attitudes by increasing the language's online visibility.\n\nPreceded by an announcement on group expectations, the second half of the day featured an introduction to the UNESCO and Rising Voices toolkit, Digital Initiatives for Indigenous Languages, and its strategies, presented by trainer Amrit Sufi.\n\nDay two continued with further training, followed by a roadmap creation activity for each participant. The purpose of this exercise was to help participants visualize the needs of Angika within their specific areas of interest and prepare a pathway for the creation of a solution.\n\nEach participant had unique aspirations for the language — some emphasized the role of music in preserving the language’s culture, others aimed to build apps, while some focused on creating illustrated books for children or language-learning apps. Several others also proposed contributing to Wikimedia projects as a way to support Angika digitally by creating content. Kumar Gaurav, the workshop coordinator contributed significantly to furthering the discussion on next steps.\n\nFollow-up activities\n\nFollowing the April 2025 workshop, several participants expressed interest in pursuing Angika Wikipedia as a method to enhance the language’s online visibility. Due to the overwhelming amount of interest, organizers arranged for a follow-up online workshop on July 17, 2025, facilitated by Nitesh Gill from Open Knowledge Initiatives. Enthusiastic participants joined to learn about different Wikimedia projects, editing Wikipedia articles, and using reliable references. New editors also discussed challenges related to account creation, blocks, and technical difficulties.\n\nThe online workshop session began with an intro to Wikipedia, followed by training in both visual and text editing, and concluded with a Q&A session. The next workshop in the series will focus on improving the quality and depth of Wikipedia articles. The goal is to continue these workshops to empower the Angika-speaking community and help them become self-sufficient contributors to digital knowledge platforms.\n\nThe April 2025 Rising Voices workshop was well-timed to meet the needs of the Angika community, which is striving to represent itself independently and collaborate in asserting its linguistic and cultural identity.",
