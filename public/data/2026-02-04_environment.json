      "title": "New catalyst turns carbon dioxide into clean fuel source",
      "summary": "Researchers have found that manganese, an abundant and inexpensive metal, can be used to efficiently convert carbon dioxide into formate, a potential hydrogen source for fuel cells. The key was a clever redesign that made the catalyst last far longer than similar low-cost materials. Surprisingly, the improved manganese catalyst even beat many expensive precious-metal options. The discovery could help turn greenhouse gas into clean energy ingredients.",
      "content": "A new study from scientists at Yale University and the University of Missouri shows that catalysts made with manganese can efficiently convert carbon dioxide into formate. Manganese is widely available and low cost, making it an attractive alternative to expensive metals. Formate is considered a promising material for storing hydrogen, which could help power the next generation of fuel cells.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Chem. The lead authors are Yale postdoctoral researcher Justin Wedal and University of Missouri graduate research assistant Kyler Virtue. Senior authors include Yale professor Nilay Hazari and University of Missouri professor Wesley Bernskoetter.\n\nWhy Hydrogen Fuel Cells Matter\n\nHydrogen fuel cells work by turning chemical energy from hydrogen into electricity, similar to how a battery operates. Although the technology holds promise for clean energy, large-scale adoption has been limited by the difficulty and cost of producing and storing hydrogen efficiently.\n\n\"Carbon dioxide utilization is a priority right now, as we look for renewable chemical feedstocks to replace feedstocks derived from fossil fuel,\" said Hazari, the John Randolph Huffman Professor of Chemistry, and chair of chemistry, in Yale's Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS).\n\nFormate as a Hydrogen Carrier\n\nFormic acid, the protonated form of formate, is already manufactured at an industrial scale. It is commonly used as a preservative, an antibacterial agent, and in leather tanning. Many scientists also see it as a practical source of hydrogen for fuel cells, provided it can be made in a sustainable and efficient way.\n\nToday, most industrial formate production relies on fossil fuels, which limits its long-term environmental benefits. Researchers say a cleaner alternative would be to produce formate directly from carbon dioxide in the air. This approach would both reduce greenhouse gas levels and create a useful chemical product.\n\nThe Catalyst Challenge\n\nTransforming carbon dioxide into formate requires a catalyst, and that has been a major obstacle. Many of the most effective catalysts developed so far depend on precious metals that are costly, scarce, and often toxic. More abundant metals tend to break down quickly, which reduces their ability to drive the chemical reaction.\n\nHow Manganese Outperformed Expectations\n\nThe research team developed a new strategy to overcome this problem. By redesigning the catalyst structure, they significantly extended the working lifetime of manganese-based catalysts. As a result, these catalysts performed better than most precious metal alternatives.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the key improvement came from adding an extra donor atom to the ligand design (ligands are atoms or molecules that bond with a metal atom and influence reactivity). This change helped stabilize the catalyst and maintain its effectiveness.\n\n\"I'm excited to see the ligand design pay off in such a meaningful way,\" said Wedal.\n\nBroader Implications for Clean Chemistry\n\nThe team believes this approach could be applied beyond carbon dioxide conversion. Similar design principles may improve catalysts used in other chemical reactions, potentially expanding the impact of the work.\n\nYale researchers Brandon Mercado and Nicole Piekut also contributed to the study. Funding for the research was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists are looking for ways to turn carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into useful and clean energy. Hydrogen fuel cells are one promising technology, but making and storing hydrogen is often expensive and difficult.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Yale University and the University of Missouri created a new catalyst using manganese, a common and cheap metal, to change carbon dioxide into formate. Formate can store hydrogen, which fuel cells use to make electricity. The team redesigned the catalyst to last much longer, and it worked better than many expensive catalysts made from rare metals.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it uses a low-cost, widely available metal instead of precious metals that are costly and rare. It also helps reduce carbon dioxide in the air while producing a clean fuel ingredient. This could make hydrogen fuel cells more practical and affordable in the future.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers plan to apply this new catalyst design to other chemical reactions, which might improve more clean energy technologies. They will also continue testing the catalyst to bring it closer to real-world use.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have developed a longer-lasting, affordable manganese catalyst that turns carbon dioxide into a clean fuel source for hydrogen energy.\n",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 03 February 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00314-4The stalled multinational effort to protect environmental and human health from plastic pollution is salvageable, with a revamped negotiation process.",
      "content": "Plastic pollution is a scourge of land and seas, and has reached Earth’s remotest regions1. Failure to deal with it could mean exposing ecosystems and people to harmful microplastics, nanoplastics and chemicals2 for centuries. Transported globally, including by rivers and the wind2, plastics are intertwined with issues around equity and justice. Many of the communities that are most harmed by plastic pollution, for instance, are those that are least responsible for producing it3 (see ‘A giant problem’).\n\nPlastics’ persistence over time, ability to cross borders and impacts on climate change demand international regulation. Production alone is responsible for around 5% (2.24 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) of global greenhouse-gas emissions, compared with the 1.4% (0.6 GtCO 2 ) of emissions that stem from aviation4. In recognition of this, in March 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), the organization’s highest environmental decision-making body, established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) to develop a global treaty to end plastic pollution, including in the ocean.\n\nSource: R. Geyer in A Brief History of Plastics 33–47 (Springer Nature, 2017).\n\nYet, following six rounds of negotiations over more than three years, delegates from 184 member states remain deadlocked. After ten days of debate at a reconvened fifth session in Geneva, Switzerland, in August 2025, no agreement on a treaty could be reached.\n\nAs official observers of the INC process (P.E. and L.D.S.) and advisers among the roughly 20-person German delegation (M.B. and A.J.), we have become convinced that the INC process — as currently designed — won’t succeed. But on 7 February, a new INC chair will be elected. Several key procedural changes, if implemented and overseen by the new chair, could break the impasse and pave the way for an effective global plastics treaty.\n\nWhy the deadlock?\n\nCreating a global plastics treaty was never going to be easy, as many experts have pointed out5.\n\nFirst, negotiators have been trying to converge on rules about regulating plastics globally within a complex and fragmented pre-existing governance landscape for waste and pollution6.\n\nWhat now for the global plastics treaty?\n\nAlthough far from adequate to deal with the growing problem of plastic pollution, various conventions already regulate pollution from ships and the cross-border movement and trade of hazardous substances and waste, including some plastics. These include the London Convention, which entered into force in 1975; Annex V to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, which entered into force in 1988; the 1992 Basel Convention; and the Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions, both of which entered into force in 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, at regional and national levels, several countries have introduced policies that affect the production or use of plastics (upstream interventions) or the collection, incineration, recycling or repurposing of plastic waste (downstream interventions).\n\nSecond, partly because most pre-existing multilateral environmental agreements regulate the downstream components of the life cycle of plastics, the INC was mandated to take a more precautionary approach and consider the full life cycle. But addressing plastic pollution holistically means considering all sorts of interlinked and politically fraught issues — from resource extraction, production, trade, use and disposal to financing and equity.\n\nThird, countries tend to take different positions on the various aspects that need to be debated, depending on the drivers of their economies.\n\nPlastic waste covers the Jambe River in West Java, Indonesia.Credit: Dasril Roszandi/NurPhoto via Zuma Press\n\nSome economies that are heavily dependent on oil and gas, such as the United States, Russia and Arab states, generally support regulating waste management — so focus on downstream interventions. Other countries, such as those with significant Indigenous populations, small island states and coastal states7, many of which are disproportionately affected by plastic pollution3, support regulations across the entire life cycle of plastics. These policies might involve banning the production of certain plastics, the regulation of chemical design, or financial aid to bolster collection infrastructure, recycling and the remediation of existing pollution in low- and middle-income countries. Highly regulated industrial economies, including the European Union (EU), Norway and Canada, meanwhile, push for ambitious global standards to level the playing field and increase their access to international markets, while protecting human and environmental health.\n\nFinally, there’s the problem of intense lobbying by industry. Fossil-fuel and petrochemical industry representatives have been present in growing numbers since the second round of negotiations. And some have used tactics, such as strong messaging on the benefits of plastics to delegates, to delay, weaken or derail measures, particularly those concerning caps on the production of plastics.\n\nAll of these challenges, however, are standard for multilateral environmental agreements. Similar difficulties, particularly with respect to member states pulling in different directions, were overcome before 198 parties ratified the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer. The same was true before 196 parties adopted the Paris agreement by consensus in 2015.\n\nIn our view, the repetitive, fragmented debates that are typical of INC negotiations are largely the result of how the process has been structured and governed.\n\nPitfalls in the process\n\nThree design flaws are proving particularly problematic.\n\nLack of prioritization and sequential decision-making. The document8 resulting from the 2022 UNEA meeting — UNEA Resolution (5/14) — states that the INC should address “the full life cycle of plastic”. But member-state delegates deliberately interpret ‘full life cycle’ differently, depending on their countries’ economic interests. In the reconvened fifth session, for example, some delegates argued that the term does not include extraction. Others maintained that it does not refer to health impacts (see ‘Interacting impacts’).\n\nLikewise, UNEA Resolution (5/14) states that a global plastics treaty must “complement” existing agreements. But, to stall proceedings, some delegates have used the argument that a number of the problems posed by plastics are already being addressed (or could be addressed) by pre-existing regulations.\n\nEnvironmental treaties are paralysed — here’s how we can do better\n\nCertain delegations repeatedly argue, for example, that together, the Basel Convention (which controls the trade and disposal of hazardous waste, including some plastics) and the Stockholm Convention (which regulates persistent organic pollutants, meaning toxic chemicals) already address problems associated with plastics and related chemicals. But most plastics would not be defined as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention. Furthermore, only about 6% of the more than 16,000 chemicals that can be intentionally used, or that are unintentionally present in plastics, are regulated under the Basel and Stockholm conventions and the Minamata Convention, which came into force in 20179.\n\nIn our view, at the very least, priorities must be defined and decisions made about whether caps on plastic production, regulations on chemicals and products of concern, and financing schemes are to be included in the treaty early in the process, before subsequent decisions can be made.\n\nCompressed timeline. The INC’s original remit was to deliver a global treaty by the end of 2024. This ambitious timeline for a complex treaty (see ‘Timelines for agreements’) has hindered prioritization and sequential decision-making, and has pushed negotiators to debate details before ensuring that everyone concurs on the basics.\n\nSource: High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution\n\nThe timeline has also driven negotiators to debate interconnecting issues in parallel sessions. In one room, participants might be discussing caps on plastics production or bans on the use of certain chemicals. In an adjoining room, another group might be trying to tackle how plastic-waste management in low- and middle-income countries might be financed. Yet, in many cases, reaching agreement on one issue could help to do the same elsewhere. If an agreement to cap plastic production was reached, for example, countries with more-ambitious goals would probably be more willing to contribute financially to collection schemes and the funding of remediation. Currently, such countries do not support subsidizing waste management for escalating amounts of production.\n\nInadequate procedural rules. Whether co-chairs (delegates appointed to moderate discussions) have the authority to synthesize contributions and propose draft text is currently unclear. This makes the drafting process inefficient and laborious, especially when combined with other ambiguities around the process and the fact that there are parallel tracks of discussion. (Each discussion group can be focused on between 2 and 20 or more treaty articles.) It also means that considerable time is spent arguing about the INC process itself rather than about the contents of the treaty.\n\nA lack of well-defined rules similarly obstructs the management of disputes. If two opposing positions emerge in a formal discussion group (called a contact group) and there is no way to reach agreement in the group, informal negotiations can take place without observers present. It is unclear, however, whether or how the ‘informals’ then affect the draft text, which further erodes trust and paves the way for yet more disagreement.\n\nA raft of plastic waste in the South China Sea drifts onto a Vietnamese beach.Credit: Prisma/ Dukas Presseagentur/Alamy\n\nWithout adequate and transparent rules on procedure, more and more text that lays out ever-more nuanced positions on an issue will continue to be added to draft text. And some delegations will keep using the ‘nothing is agreed until everything is agreed’ mantra to stall negotiations.\n\nSince the second INC session was held in Paris, delegates have been unable to agree even on a process decision — specifically, whether to allow, under well-defined circumstances, delegates to vote and decisions to be based on majority rule rather than on consensus. We became convinced at the reconvened fifth session in Geneva that the current structure of the INC process is not fit for purpose. During the fifth negotiation round in Busan, South Korea, delegates seemed to be converging on how to deal with discarded fishing gear. In Geneva, the text was opened up for discussion again, and because so much nuance was added, agreement broke down.\n\nAnother way",

      "title": "The Earth911 Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Guide",
      "summary": "Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are found in many devices we use every day, like smartphones, laptops,...\nThe post The Earth911 Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Guide appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are found in many devices we use every day, like smartphones, laptops, tablets, wireless earbuds, power tools, e-bikes, and electric vehicles. By 2023, there were more than 40 million electric vehicles on the road worldwide, and billions of portable electronics used Li-ion cells. These batteries are valuable for recycling, but they can be dangerous if not disposed of correctly.\n\nIn 2024, the lithium-ion battery recycling market was worth over $7 billion and is expected to grow to $24 billion by 2032, with annual growth of more than 20%. This growth is driven by the demand for minerals needed for electrification. Batteries contain valuable materials like cobalt, nickel, lithium, and graphite, which can be reused to make new batteries.\n\nThe Critical Safety Issue: Fire Risk\n\nMore batteries mean greater risk for recycling workers, and at home, where they are stored, even expired batteries can cause fires.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are the biggest fire risk in the waste and recycling system. A 2024 report from the National Waste & Recycling Association found that U.S. recycling facilities have more than 5,000 fires each year, many caused by lithium batteries thrown away incorrectly. From 2022 to 2025, facility fires increased by 26% compared to the 2016-2021 average, mostly because more batteries are ending up in the waste stream.\n\nLi-ion batteries can catch fire if they are crushed, punctured, or damaged, which often happens in garbage trucks or recycling machines. This damage can cause a chain reaction called “thermal runaway,” where the battery heats up quickly and can ignite nearby materials. Even batteries that seem “dead” still have enough energy left to start a fire.\n\nDisposable vaping devices are a growing fire risk. About 1.2 billion single-use vapes are thrown away each year, and each one has a small lithium battery. Because these devices have thin cases, they are easily damaged and can quickly overheat. Even a small spark can start a fire.\n\nNever put lithium batteries in curbside recycling or trash. A single battery in a recycling truck can cause a fire that destroys the vehicle and endangers workers. Always use battery recycling programs.\n\nWhy Li-ion Battery Recycling Makes Economic Sense\n\nUnlike alkaline batteries, which are not worth recycling for their materials, lithium-ion batteries have valuable contents that make recycling worthwhile:\n\nCobalt: Used in many Li-ion cathodes (particularly NMC and LCO chemistries), cobalt is expensive, and current supplies are concentrated in politically unstable regions. Recycling cobalt can offset the high costs of virgin material for battery manufacturers.\n\nNickel: Essential for high-energy-density batteries, nickel is an expensive commodity. NMC and NCA battery types include substantial nickel content.\n\nLithium: While lithium prices have fluctuated significantly, the element remains critical for all Li-ion batteries. Modern hydrometallurgical processes can recover over 90% of the lithium content in a used battery.\n\nGraphite: This material is used in battery anodes. As recycling methods improve, recovering graphite is becoming more practical and profitable.\n\nCopper and aluminum: These metals are found in the parts of batteries that connect the electrodes to the contacts. Both are valuable and easy to recycle.\n\nSeveral companies, including Redwood Materials, Li-Cycle, and Ascend Elements, have recycling facilities in the United States. In October 2025, Redwood Materials raised $350 million to expand operations. Battery recycling has become a mainstream business.\n\nThe LFP Challenge\n\nLithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries now account for roughly 40% of electric vehicle batteries worldwide. LFP batteries are safer—less prone to catching fire or thermal runaway—and do not use cobalt or nickel, which are valuable for recycling and important to traditional lithium-ion battery chemistries. However, because LFP batteries use iron and phosphate, which are much less valuable, recycling them is less profitable and more challenging. This means that recycling LFP batteries often requires different business strategies and policy support than recycling other Li-ion batteries.\n\nExtended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws are shifting the financial and logistical burden of end-of-use battery management from consumers and municipalities to the manufacturers and brands that put these products into the market. As states implement EPR frameworks for batteries—Colorado, California, and Oregon have already passed battery EPR legislation—producers are becoming legally obligated to fund and manage collection and recycling infrastructure regardless of whether the recovered materials generate profit.\n\nThis type of regulation is especially important for LFP batteries. Since the materials in LFP batteries are not as valuable as those in other Li-ion batteries, there is little financial motivation for recyclers to process them without legal requirements. EPR laws ensure LFP batteries are recycled because the law requires it, not just because it is financially profitable.\n\nThe EU’s new Battery Regulation, which started in 2024, shows what U.S. policy might look like in the future. It sets required collection rates, recycled content rules, and producer responsibilities for all battery types. LFP battery makers will need to set up their own take-back programs, join producer groups, or work with certified recyclers.\n\nHow to Recycle Lithium-Ion Batteries\n\nIf you notice your Li-ion battery is bulging, take special care to avoid fire and contact with its chemicals.\n\nConsumer Electronics (Phones, Laptops, Tablets)\n\nMost often, you’ll dispose of a Li-ion battery along with the device it powers. When trading in or recycling electronics:\n\nManufacturer take-back: Apple, Samsung, Dell, HP, and most major manufacturers accept their products for recycling and properly handle the batteries.\n\nRetailer programs: Best Buy accepts most consumer electronics with batteries for recycling. Wireless carrier stores (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) accept phones.\n\nE-waste events: Many communities hold periodic electronics recycling events that accept Li-ion powered devices.\n\nStandalone Batteries and Power Tools\n\nThe Battery Network/Call2Recycle: Over 20,000 drop-off locations accept lithium-ion batteries weighing up to 11 pounds and with a capacity of up to 300 watt-hours. Use the locator tool to find participating retailers, including The Home Depot, Lowe’s, Best Buy, and Staples.\n\nTerraCycle-backed programs: Stanley Black & Decker offers free mail-in recycling for DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, BLACK+DECKER, STANLEY, PORTER-CABLE, and other brand tools with non-removable lithium batteries.\n\nHousehold hazardous waste: Many municipal HHW programs accept lithium batteries, particularly larger or damaged ones.\n\nE-Bike Batteries\n\nE-bike batteries are bigger than most consumer batteries and need special handling. The Battery Network runs a recycling program just for e-bike batteries, with over 1,600 trained collection sites. In 2023, this program collected more than 60,000 pounds of e-bike batteries.\n\nElectric Vehicle Batteries\n\nEV batteries are typically handled by dealerships and manufacturers as part of vehicle service or end-of-life processing. Many EV batteries are first repurposed for stationary energy storage applications before eventually being recycled. If you have an EV battery that needs recycling, contact your vehicle manufacturer or dealership.\n\nSafe Handling Guidelines\n\nLithium-ion batteries need to be handled more carefully than other types of batteries:\n\nTape terminals: Cover battery terminals with electrical tape or place each battery in a separate plastic bag to prevent shorts.\n\nCover battery terminals with electrical tape or place each battery in a separate plastic bag to prevent shorts.

Recycle promptly: Don’t let used batteries pile up. Take them to drop-off locations regularly.\n\nState Requirements and EPR Laws\n\nExtended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws are rapidly expanding to cover lithium-ion batteries. Current and upcoming requirements include:\n\nCalifornia (AB 2440 & SB 1215): These laws impose comprehensive recycling of all battery types. Producer stewardship programs must be in place by April 2027. Consumer recycling fees were added to battery-embedded products in January 2026.\n\nWashington (SB 5144): This portable battery disposal ban takes effect in January 2027.\n\nWashington, D.C.: A battery disposal ban has been in effect since January 2022 under the Zero Waste Omnibus Amendment Act.\n\nIllinois: The Battery Stewardship Act requires manufacturers to submit approved plans by January 2026, and the disposal ban will take effect in January 2028.\n\nNew Jersey: The Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Battery Management Act became the first state law to include EV propulsion batteries in 2024.\n\nThe federal government is paying more attention to battery recycling, with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act providing grants for battery manufacturing and recycling. States are still leading the way on EPR requirements. It is not yet clear how federal battery recycling programs will develop in the future.\n\nRecycle Batteries for a Cleaner, Secure Economy\n\nLithium-ion battery recycling is essential for environmental and safety reasons. The valuable materials inside these batteries make recycling economically viable and support domestic supply chains for critical minerals. However, the immediate concern for your community is fire prevention: keeping Li-ion batteries out of trash and curbside recycling protects recycling workers, prevents facility damage, and ensures these hazardous materials are properly managed.\n\nTake action now! use the free battery drop-off locations at major retailers to recycle your batteries safely. For devices with built-in batteries, return them through manufacturer or retailer take-back programs. Always tape battery terminals before recycling to prevent fires during transport. Your efforts make a real difference—help protect your community, environment, and supply chains by recycling every lithium-ion battery properly.",

      "title": "Why the future of meat production is in vats, not farms",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "I recently ate a pig that’s alive and well at a sanctuary in upstate New York. Her name is Dawn, and she donated a bit of fat, which a company called Mission Barns grows in bioreactors, then blends with plant-based ingredients to create pork products (like the meatballs above) that taste darn near like the real thing. Its “cultivated” offerings join a herd of alternative meats — including those from mainstays like Impossible Foods and Eat Just — that are challenging the traditional livestock industry, which uses immense swaths of land and spews staggering quantities of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn his new book Meat: How the Next Agricultural Revolution Will Transform Humanity’s Favorite Food — and Our Future, Bruce Friedrich, founder and president of the Good Food Institute, catalogs the extraordinary costs of conventional meat production and the vast potential for alternative culinary technologies. Grist sat down with Friedrich to talk about the progress, challenges, and potential of the fledgling industry. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nQ. It’d be great to get a rundown on — if you’ll pardon the pun — your beef with meat.\n\nA. Conventional meat production has significant external costs. In 2006, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization released a more-than-400-page report called Livestock’s Long Shadow. It said that animal-product production is responsible for all of the most serious environmental harms at every scale, from local to global. It looked at deforestation, climate change, air pollution, water pollution, water depletion, loss of biodiversity, and said that the inefficiency and extra stages of production involved in producing animal products made meat, dairy, and eggs a significant contributor to all of those, including being the number one contributor to deforestation.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nAll of those environmental consequences have gotten worse. If it takes 9 calories of feed to get 1 calorie of chicken, or 10 or more calories of feed to get a calorie of farmed fish or pork, and even more calories to get a calorie from a ruminant animal — a cow or a sheep or a goat — that’s an inherent inefficiency that really is 800 percent food waste, or more. All of the inefficiency adds up, and that’s why the latest numbers are that roughly 20 percent of climate emissions are attributable to animal agriculture.\n\nQ. We’re at an interesting point in which the technology has gotten extremely advanced when it comes to replicating what is grown in an animal in a field somewhere. What are the options for alternative meats?\n\nA. It’s very much similar to how we think about renewable energy or electric vehicles. There is a recognition that the world is going to consume more energy, the world is going to drive more miles. The world is also going to eat more meat. In the last 25 years, meat production is up about 65 percent. It will probably be up something like 65 percent again through 2050, and that means all of the external costs of meat production continue to get worse.\n\nJust like if you’re talking about energy, we need an all-of-the-above strategy. So we want everything from more energy-efficient light bulbs to houses, but we do need renewable energy as one of the tools in the toolkit. Here, the solution is to figure out how we create plant-based meat that is indistinguishable and less expensive, and how we grow actual animal meat in factories rather than on live animals.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nQ. You talk in the book about a number of ways this can be incentivized, though there are many states that have already done things like ban cultivated meat. What could be done in these early days of alt meats that could accelerate both the science and the adoption?\n\nA. One very encouraging aspect of a shift in the direction of plant-based meat and cultivated meat is that because they are so much more efficient, there is a massive profit motive. And there is also a massive food-security motive for countries like China, Japan, and Korea that have significant food self-sufficiency concerns. Countries that cannot feed themselves recognize that that is a significant national security threat and are highly motivated to figure out how to feed themselves. These countries recognize that if they can produce meat with a fraction of the inputs required to produce animal-based meat, that will be a boon to their national security. And in the United States, we’re also seeing bipartisan support for alternative proteins for economic competitiveness reasons.\n\nQ. One challenge now is that there’s a backlash in the United States against ultra-processed foods. Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have been struggling financially lately, perhaps as part of that. Is that a surmountable challenge for the industry?\n\nA. The first thing to say is that the plant-based meats are significantly healthier than what they are replacing. All of the plant-based meats that consumers like best, relative to animal-based meat, have less fat, less saturated fat, less cholesterol, more fiber, and more protein. All of the plant-based meats are significantly less calorically dense than the animal-based meat they’re replacing. The indictment against ultra-processed foods works, generally speaking, as shorthand for products that are low in fiber, calorically dense, high in fat, high in sugar. But comparing plant-based meat to Doritos and Coca-Cola doesn’t make a lot of sense. There are some questions around some of the other ultra-processed foods, but the science is clear that the meat and dairy alternatives do not lead to bad health outcomes.\n\nQ. You make the point in the book that these companies should collaborate with the traditional meat industry, reforming the industry instead of replacing it. Why?\n\nA. The goal of the meat industry is to produce high-quality protein profitably. Figuring out how to produce that same end product far more efficiently is going to be extremely profitable for the companies and countries that lean in. If you’re sort of analogizing to photography, nobody wants to be Kodak. Everybody wants to be Canon, and to seize the opportunity rather than to pretend it doesn’t exist.",
