      "content": "Washington State University scientists have identified a way to interfere with a key viral protein, stopping viruses from entering cells where they can trigger disease. The finding points to a potential new direction for antiviral therapies in the future.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nanoscale, focused on uncovering and blocking a specific molecular interaction that herpes viruses rely on to gain access to cells. The work brought together researchers from the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and the Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology.\n\n\"Viruses are very smart,\" said Jin Liu, corresponding author of the study and a professor in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering. \"The whole process of invading cells is very complex, and there are a lot of interactions. Not all of the interactions are equally important -- most of them may just be background noise, but there are some critical interactions.\"\n\nUnderstanding the Viral Fusion Process\n\nThe team examined a viral \"fusion\" protein that herpes viruses use to merge with and enter cells, a process responsible for many infections. Scientists still have limited insight into how this large and complex protein changes shape to make cell entry possible, which helps explain why vaccines for these widespread viruses have been difficult to develop.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, researchers turned to artificial intelligence and detailed molecular simulations. Professors Prashanta Dutta and Jin Liu analyzed thousands of potential interactions within the protein to identify a single amino acid that plays an essential role in viral entry. They created an algorithm to examine interactions among amino acids, the basic components of proteins, and then applied machine learning to sort through them and pinpoint the most influential ones.\n\nUsing AI to Pinpoint a Critical Weak Spot\n\nAfter identifying the key amino acid, the research team moved to laboratory experiments led by Anthony Nicola from the Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology. By introducing a targeted mutation to this amino acid, they found that the virus could no longer successfully fuse with cells. As a result, the herpes virus was blocked from entering the cells altogether.\n\nAccording to Liu, the use of simulations and machine learning was essential because experimentally testing even a single interaction can take months. Narrowing down the most important interaction ahead of time made the experimental work far more efficient.\n\n\"It was just a single interaction from thousands of interactions. If we don't do the simulation and instead did this work by trial and error, it could have taken years to find,\" said Liu. \"The combination of theoretical computational work with the experiments is so efficient and can accelerate the discovery of these important biological interactions.\"\n\nWhat Researchers Still Need to Learn\n\nAlthough the team confirmed the importance of this specific interaction, many questions remain about how the mutation changes the structure of the full fusion protein. The researchers plan to continue using simulations and machine learning to better understand how small molecular changes ripple through the entire protein.\n\n\"There is a gap between what the experimentalists see and what we can see in the simulation,\" said Liu. \"The next step is how this small interaction affects the structural change at larger scales. That is also very challenging for us.\"\n\nThe research was carried out by Liu, Dutta, and Nicola along with PhD students Ryan Odstrcil, Albina Makio, and McKenna Hull. Funding for the project was provided by the National Institutes of Health.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn a transformative leap for regenerative medicine, scientists have developed the first entirely human-engineered bone marrow system. This lab-grown “blood factory” may change how researchers study blood diseases, test treatments, and ultimately care for patients battling conditions like leukemia and anemia.\n\nConstructed from human cells and built to replicate the biological complexity of actual bone marrow, the new model is not just a technical achievement. It also offers a potential alternative to animal testing and brings precision medicine closer to reality.\n\nWhat’s the deal with bone marrow?\n\nBone marrow plays a vital but often overlooked role. Hidden inside our bones, it is responsible for generating the blood cells that fuel our immune systems and carry oxygen throughout the body. When that process breaks down, as in cancers like leukemia, the consequences can be life-threatening.\n\nUnderstanding how blood is made, and how it goes awry, has traditionally required animal models or simple cell cultures. But these systems fall short of fully capturing how human marrow functions. That is what researchers at the University of Basel and University Hospital Basel set out to change.\n\nTheir study, published in Cell Stem Cell, describes a bioengineered model that mimics the complex, three-dimensional environment where human blood cells are born.\n\nBuilding a human niche from the ground up\n\nThe team, led by Professor Ivan Martin and Dr. Andrés García García, began with a synthetic scaffold made from hydroxyapatite, a mineral naturally found in human bones. Into this framework, they introduced reprogrammed human pluripotent stem cells. These stem cells are capable of developing into multiple types of cells, including those found in the bone marrow.\n\nThrough a carefully staged process, the researchers guided these stem cells to generate a diverse population of blood-producing cells. The result was a small but functionally rich human bone marrow model just eight millimetres in diameter and four millimetres thick that successfully maintained blood cell production in the lab for several weeks.\n\nMost importantly, it recreated a specific zone in the marrow known as the endosteal niche. This region, located near the surface of bones, is where blood stem cells live and where certain blood cancers are known to resist treatment.\n\nUntil now, no lab-grown model had succeeded in capturing the biological complexity of this niche. “Our model brings us closer to the biology of the human organism,” said Martin. “It could serve as a complement to many animal experiments in the study of blood formation in both healthy and diseased conditions.”\n\nToward better treatments and fewer animal tests\n\nThe ethical and practical implications are significant. By offering a human-specific model, the system could reduce reliance on animal testing while improving scientific accuracy. This aligns with broader efforts in the scientific community to refine, reduce, and replace animal experiments.\n\nThe research team also sees promise in using the model for drug development. While the current version is too large for high-throughput testing, miniaturised versions could one day allow researchers to test multiple drug compounds in parallel.\n\nLooking further ahead, the researchers envision even more ambitious applications. In theory, doctors could use a patient’s own cells to build personalised marrow models, allowing for treatment plans tailored to each individual’s biology. Such a strategy could significantly improve outcomes in blood cancer therapy.\n\nBut the road to that future is still long. “For this specific purpose, the size of our bone marrow model might be too large,” noted García García. Further refinements, including downsizing the model and integrating it into broader diagnostic workflows, would be necessary.\n\nA foundation for future care\n\nEven with those caveats, the creation of a fully human, lab-grown bone marrow system marks an important milestone in medical research. It shifts the focus from animal proxies toward human-specific biology and opens up new possibilities for testing drugs, studying disease, and designing therapies that meet patients where they are.\n\nThis “blood factory” may be miniature in size, but it holds enormous potential both for understanding the inner workings of the human body and for reshaping the way we treat its failures.\n\nSource study: Cell Stem Cell—Macro-scale, scaffold-assisted model of the human bone marrow endosteal niche using hiPSC-vascularized osteoblastic organoids",

Their findings indicate that lifestyle choices and stress management can meaningfully affect the rate of brain aging, even among individuals who live with chronic pain.\n\n\"These are things that people have some level of control over,\" said Jared Tanner, Ph.D., a research associate professor of clinical and health psychology at the University of Florida and one of the study's leaders. \"You can learn how to perceive stress differently. Poor sleep is very treatable. Optimism can be practiced.\"\n\nMeasuring Brain Age With MRI and Machine Learning\n\nThe study tracked 128 adults in midlife and older adulthood, most of whom had chronic musculoskeletal pain related to or at risk of knee osteoarthritis. Over a period of two years, researchers used MRI scans processed through a machine learning model to estimate each participant's \"brain age\" and compare it to their chronological age. The difference between the two, known as the brain age gap, offered a single measure of whole-brain health.\n\nCertain hardships, including chronic pain, lower income, limited education and social disadvantages, were linked to brains that appeared older. However, those associations decreased over time. Instead, protective behaviors such as restorative sleep, healthy body weight, effective stress management, avoiding tobacco and maintaining supportive relationships showed a stronger and more lasting connection to younger appearing brains.\n\nProtective Habits Linked to Slower Brain Aging\n\nParticipants who reported the highest number of protective factors began the study with brains that looked eight years younger than their actual age, and their brain aging continued to progress more slowly throughout the two-year follow-up.\n\n\"The message is consistent across our studies, health promoting behaviors are not only associated with lower pain and better physical functioning, they appear to actually bolster health in an additive fashion at a meaningful level,\" said Kimberly Sibille, Ph.D., an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UF and senior author of the report.\n\nSibille, Tanner and collaborators across UF and other institutions published their results on in the journal Brain Communications.\n\nWhy Brain Age Matters for Long-Term Health\n\nResearchers have known for years that aging brains are more susceptible to cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Earlier studies often examined isolated brain regions, but pain, stress and major life events tend to influence widespread neural networks. The brain age gap -- the difference between someone's actual age and how old their brain appears on imaging -- provides a single measurement that reflects these broader effects.\n\nAlthough the research centered on people experiencing chronic pain, the authors note that habits such as lowering stress, strengthening social support and maintaining healthy sleep patterns are likely to benefit brain aging in a wide range of individuals.\n\n\"Literally for every additional healthy promoting factor there is some evidence of neurobiological benefit,\" Sibille said. \"Our findings support the growing body of evidence that Lifestyle is medicine.\"",

People with this type of cancer typically receive endocrine therapy, involving oestrogen-blocking drugs such as tamoxifen, but the development of resistance to this treatment is a common clinical challenge2. One way to enhance the effectiveness of endocrine therapy and delay the emergence of resistance is through periodic fasting, when, under clinical supervision, people restrict their eating and consume few or no calories for time spans of hours to days on a regular cycle. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect have been hard to determine3.

      "personality_title": "New research explains how fasting improves breast cancer treatment",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Breast cancer often involves a protein called estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα), which helps cancer cells grow. Many patients receive hormone-blocking drugs like tamoxifen to slow the cancer, but these drugs can stop working over time.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists studied mice and found that fasting, which means not eating for certain periods under medical supervision, can make hormone therapy work better. They discovered that fasting changes signals in the body and how certain genes behave, helping the treatment fight cancer more effectively.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it shows exactly how fasting helps improve treatment, not just that it does. Understanding the biological reasons means doctors might use fasting safely alongside hormone therapy to help patients respond better and for longer.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will likely test fasting combined with hormone therapy in more human studies. This could lead to new treatment plans that include controlled fasting to help breast cancer patients.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists found that fasting changes body signals and gene activity to make breast cancer hormone therapy work better, offering a new way to improve treatment outcomes.",
      "personality_title_fr": "Une nouvelle recherche explique comment le jeûne améliore le traitement du cancer du sein",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Le cancer du sein implique souvent une protéine appelée récepteur alpha des œstrogènes (ERα), qui aide les cellules cancéreuses à se développer. Beaucoup de patients reçoivent des médicaments bloquant les hormones, comme le tamoxifène, mais ces médicaments peuvent devenir inefficaces avec le temps.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des scientifiques ont étudié des souris et ont découvert que le jeûne, c’est-à-dire ne pas manger pendant certaines périodes sous surveillance médicale, peut rendre la thérapie hormonale plus efficace. Ils ont trouvé que le jeûne modifie les signaux dans le corps et le comportement de certains gènes, aidant ainsi le traitement à mieux combattre le cancer.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte est importante car elle montre précisément comment le jeûne améliore le traitement, pas seulement qu’il le fait. Comprendre ces mécanismes biologiques pourrait permettre aux médecins d’utiliser le jeûne en toute sécurité avec la thérapie hormonale pour aider les patients à mieux répondre au traitement et plus longtemps.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs vont probablement tester le jeûne associé à la thérapie hormonale chez des patients humains. Cela pourrait conduire à de nouveaux protocoles de traitement incluant un jeûne contrôlé pour aider les personnes atteintes de cancer du sein.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Les scientifiques ont découvert que le jeûne modifie les signaux corporels et l’activité des gènes pour rendre la thérapie hormonale du cancer du sein plus efficace, offrant une nouvelle voie pour améliorer les résultats du traitement.",
      "personality_title_es": "Nueva investigación explica cómo el ayuno mejora el tratamiento del cáncer de mama",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – El cáncer de mama a menudo tiene una proteína llamada receptor de estrógeno alfa (ERα), que ayuda a que las células cancerosas crezcan. Muchos pacientes reciben medicamentos que bloquean las hormonas, como el tamoxifeno, pero estos medicamentos pueden dejar de funcionar con el tiempo.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Científicos estudiaron ratones y descubrieron que el ayuno, que significa no comer durante ciertos períodos bajo supervisión médica, puede hacer que la terapia hormonal funcione mejor. Descubrieron que el ayuno cambia señales en el cuerpo y cómo se comportan ciertos genes, ayudando a que el tratamiento combata el cáncer de forma más efectiva.\n\n**Impacto** – Este hallazgo es importante porque muestra exactamente cómo el ayuno ayuda a mejorar el tratamiento, no solo que lo hace. Entender estas razones biológicas puede permitir que los médicos usen el ayuno de forma segura junto con la terapia hormonal para que los pacientes respondan mejor y por más tiempo.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores probablemente probarán el ayuno combinado con la terapia hormonal en más estudios con humanos. Esto podría llevar a nuevos planes de tratamiento que incluyan ayuno controlado para ayudar a pacientes con cáncer de mama.\n\n**Frase clave** – Los científicos encontraron que el ayuno cambia señales corporales y la actividad genética para hacer que la terapia hormonal contra el cáncer de mama sea más efectiva, ofreciendo una nueva forma de mejorar los resultados del tratamiento.",
