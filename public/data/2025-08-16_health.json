      "summary": "Arizona State University scientists have unveiled NasRED, a revolutionary one-drop blood test that can detect diseases like COVID-19, Ebola, HIV, and Lyme with incredible speed and precision. Using gold nanoparticles to spot microscopic disease markers, the device delivers results in just 15 minutes—outperforming traditional lab tests in sensitivity, speed, and affordability. Portable and costing only $2 per test, it could be deployed from remote clinics to urban hospitals, offering a lifeline for early detection and outbreak control worldwide.",
      "content": "Researchers at Arizona State University have developed a breakthrough diagnostic tool that could transform how quickly and reliably we detect illnesses like COVID-19, Ebola, AIDS or Lyme disease. The test uses just a single drop of blood, costs a couple of dollars and delivers results in only 15 minutes.\n\nIn a new study, the researchers show the test can detect the virus that causes COVID-19 with pinpoint accuracy, clearly distinguishing it from other infections.\n\nThe new diagnostic device, called NasRED (Nanoparticle-Supported Rapid Electronic Detection), is simple and portable enough to be used almost anywhere -- from remote rural clinics to busy urban hospitals. The tool provides lab-quality accuracy without expensive equipment and does not require specialized training, giving it the potential to become a public health game changer.\n\n\"We have the speed and ease of use of a rapid antigen test with sensitivity that's even better than lab-based tests,\" says Chao Wang, lead author of the new study. \"This is very difficult to achieve.\"\n\nWang is an associate professor with the Biodesign Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics and ASU's School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering. He is joined by ASU researchers Yeji Choi, Seyedsina Mirjalili, Ashif Ikbal, Sean McClure, Maziyar Kalateh Mohammadi, Scott Clemens, Jose Solano, John Heggland, Tingting Zhang and Jiawei Zuo.\n\nThe research appears in the current issue of the journal ACS Nano.\n\nHalting the spread of infectious diseases\n\nInfectious diseases are one of humanity's deadliest threats, causing immense suffering and economic damage worldwide. Collectively, infectious diseases cause over 10 million deaths around the world each year, and they are the leading cause of death in low-income countries.\n\nNearly 800,000 Americans die or are permanently disabled every year due to diagnostic errors, according to a study published in BMJ Quality & Safety. Many of these cases involve infections or vascular events that might have been treatable if caught early.\n\nIn many low- and middle-income countries, access to reliable diagnostic testing is limited or nonexistent. Expensive equipment, shortages of trained personnel and long turnaround times all contribute to delayed or missed diagnoses -- often with deadly consequences.\n\nA fast, affordable and portable test like NasRED would enable frontline health workers globally to detect infections early and respond before outbreaks spiral out of control.\n\n\"In many parts of the world, including the U.S., diseases are spreading, but people often don't get tested -- even for something like HIV. Ideally, you'd want to test them regularly, to catch infections early,\" Wang says. \"For example, people who use injection drugs are at higher risk for HIV or HCV, but they may be living in the streets and hard to reach. If we don't test them consistently over time, we may miss the chance to intervene -- until they develop serious complications like cancer or liver disease, when it's much harder to treat.\"\n\nStriking diagnostic gold\n\nAt the core of the new test are tiny gold nanoparticles, engineered to detect extremely small amounts of disease-related proteins. Researchers coat these nanoparticles with special molecules designed to detect specific diseases.\n\nSome nanoparticles carry antibodies, tiny molecules that act like magnets. Antibodies stick to proteins released by viruses or bacteria when they infect the body. Other nanoparticles carry antigens, fragments of proteins taken directly from viruses or bacteria themselves. These naturally attract antibodies produced by the body to fight infections.\n\nOnce coated, these nanoparticles are combined with a tiny sample of bodily fluid, such as a drop of blood, saliva or nasal fluid. If a disease is present, most nanoparticles will sink to the bottom of the tube. If there is no disease, they will remain suspended throughout the liquid.\n\nThe NasRED device shines a small beam of LED light through the liquid at the top of the tube. The team built a custom electronic detector that senses how much light gets through the tube. More light means the nanoparticles have sunk to the bottom, leaving the top fluid clearer, meaning that the disease is present.\n\nAccurate, accessible and affordable\n\nThe device is so sensitive it can detect disease even when only a few hundred molecules are present in a tiny fluid sample -- just a fraction of a single drop. This is a concentration nearly 100,000 times lower than what standard laboratory tests require.\n\nAdding to its promise is NasRED's portability and affordability. The current gold standards for testing, like PCR or ELISA, require expensive equipment and trained technicians. NasRED is compact and user-friendly. The researchers estimate each test costs $2, making it ideal for use in low-resource or remote locations.\n\nNasRED has the potential to fill a critical diagnostic gap, especially for diseases that are difficult to detect early, such as hepatitis C, HIV or Lyme disease. It is also promising for emerging outbreaks with low prevalence but high risk. Such diseases often go undiagnosed because running a lab test for just one or two patients isn't cost effective. NasRED bridges that gap by offering a highly sensitive test that works immediately and economically at the point of care.\n\nWhile NasRED currently requires small, benchtop machines for spinning and mixing samples, the researchers are working to further miniaturize and automate the process. With continued development, the technology might one day become a convenient home test, similar to existing rapid COVID-19 tests. However, it would have vastly superior sensitivity and broader applications.\n\nSignificant leap forward in diagnostics\n\nNasRED dramatically surpasses existing diagnostic standards. The new study shows that NasRED is roughly 3,000 times more sensitive than ELISA, requires 16 times less sample volume, and delivers results approximately 30 times faster.\n\nAn earlier version of the technology detected Ebola in a tiny sample of blood. \"For the new technology, we pushed the sensitivity down to the attomolar range,\" Wang says. That's like detecting a single drop of ink in 20 Olympic swimming pools.\n\nThe technology holds promise for detecting viral loads directly from bodily fluids without the complicated sample preparation used in PCR-based methods. In preliminary tests with actual coronavirus particles, NasRED achieved sensitivities comparable to Abbott ID NOW, a popular molecular test for many diseases such as COVID-19.\n\n\"One of the strengths of our sensor is that it's highly modular,\" Wang says. \"The nanoparticles are designed so that we can easily swap in different proteins, allowing the same platform to be adapted for many different diseases. We've already demonstrated this approach in our research on Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, as well as cancer biomarkers, Alzheimer's-related proteins, Lyme disease and African swine fever.\"\n\nWang recently received the Bay Area Lyme Foundation Emerging Leader Award and will make use of the high sensitivity and portability of this new technology to detect early Lyme infection.\n\nAs the technology evolves, its range of applications may extend beyond infectious diseases. Early detection of cancers, real-time monitoring of chronic illnesses and improved surveillance of public health threats are all within reach.",

      "content": "A brain scan (artificially coloured) produced by magnetic resonance imaging. Credit: K H Fung/Science Photo Library\n\nA brain implant can decode a person’s internal chatter — but the device works only if the user thinks of a preset password1.\n\nThe mind-reading device, or brain–computer interface (BCI), accurately deciphered up to 74% of imagined sentences. The system began decoding users’ internal speech — the silent dialogue in people’s minds — only when they thought of a specific keyword. This ensured that the system did not accidentally translate sentences that users would rather keep to themselves.\n\nThe study, published in Cell on 14 August, represents a “technically impressive and meaningful step” towards developing BCI devices that accurately decode internal speech, says Sarah Wandelt, a neural engineer at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, who was not involved in the work. The password mechanism also offers a straightforward way to protect users’ privacy, a crucial feature for real-world use, adds Wandelt.\n\nAvoiding eavesdropping\n\nBCI systems translate brain signals into text or audio and have become promising tools for restoring speech in people with paralysis or limited muscle control. Most devices require users to try to speak out loud, which can be exhausting and uncomfortable. Last year, Wandelt and her colleagues developed the first BCI for decoding internal speech, which relied on signals in the supramarginal gyrus, a brain region that plays a major part in speech and language2.\n\nA study participant who has trouble speaking clearly because of a stroke uses the brain–computer interface.Credit: Emory BrainGate Team\n\nBut there’s a risk that these internal-speech BCIs could accidentally decode sentences users never intended to utter, says Erin Kunz, a neural engineer at Stanford University in California. “We wanted to investigate this robustly,” says Kunz, who co-authored the new study.\n\nFirst, Kunz and her colleagues analysed brain signals collected by microelectrodes placed in the motor cortex — the region involved in voluntary movements — of four participants. All four have trouble speaking, one because of a stroke and three because of motor neuron disease, a degeneration of the nerves that leads to loss of muscle control. The researchers instructed participants to either attempt to say a set of words or imagine saying them.\n\nRecordings of the participants’ brain activity showed that attempted and internal speech originated in the same brain region and generated similar neural signals, but those associated with internal speech were weaker.\n\nBrain implant translates thoughts to speech in an instant\n\nNext, Kunz and her colleagues used this data to train artificial-intelligence models to recognize phonemes, the smallest units of speech, in the neural recordings. The team used language models to stitch these phonemes together to form words and sentences in real time, drawn from a vocabulary of 125,000 words.\n\nThe device correctly interpreted 74% of sentences imagined by two participants who were instructed to think of specific phrases. This level of accuracy is similar to that of the team’s earlier BCI for attempted speech, says Kunz.",

      "content": "Virus-based treatments are already approved to treat several types of cancer, and combining them with bacteria could make them even more effective\n\nThe herpes virus can help treat severe skin cancer Science Photo Library/Alamy\n\nViruses have shown huge potential in treating various kinds of cancer, but the immune response has limited their application to tumours near the body’s surface. Now, scientists have demonstrated that shielding viruses with genetically engineered bacteria bypasses this issue, slowing the growth of severe tumours in mice.\n\nA few therapies that use cancer-killing, or oncolytic, viruses have been approved worldwide to treat cancers of the skin, brain and head and neck. These involve injecting the genetically engineered viruses directly into tumours, where they infect and kill cancer cells by bursting them apart.\n\nBut for harder-to-reach tumours deeper within the body, such viruses must be injected into the blood, where the immune system quickly destroys them before they get to the intended target.\n\nTo get around this hurdle, Zakary Singer at Columbia University in New York and his colleagues have made use of Salmonella typhimurium bacteria that have been genetically engineered to be harmless and provoke a weaker immune response than oncolytic viruses. They further engineered the bacteria to carry the genome of Senecavirus A, a virus which has been shown to kill human cancer cells in lab and animal experiments.\n\n“We’re talking about a Trojan horse approach, where the bacteria hide this virus [from the immune system], shuttle it where it needs to go and then deliver it so it can do its cancer-killing business,” says Singer. The bacteria are engineered to enter cancer cells and then release copies of the viral genome, he says.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Health Check Expert insight and news on scientific developments in health, nutrition and fitness, every Saturday. Sign up to newsletter\n\nTo put their approach to the test, the researchers grew nerve tumours on the backs of mice. One week later, they injected the virus-carrying bacteria, which they called CAPPSID, into the blood of half the mice. The remaining mice received Senecavirus A without the bacteria.\n\nWithin a day, the team found that CAPPSID – which they labelled with a fluorescent tag – had accumulated in the tumours, where immune responses are typically suppressed. Meanwhile, any CAPPSID remaining in the blood or that had reached healthy tissues was quickly eliminated by the immune system, says Singer.\n\nIt took 11 days, on average, for tumours in the Senecavirus A-only group to reach the maximum size allowed before ethical regulations dictate that the mice had to be euthanised. In contrast, it took 21 days for tumours to reach this size in mice that received CAPPSID. None of the mice experienced any apparent side effects.\n\n“The data looks absolutely wonderful,” says Guy Simpson at the University of Surrey in the UK. The team demonstrated that this approach works well against fast-growing tumours, like those derived from nerve cells, but it could be even more effective against slower-growing ones, he says.\n\nIn another part of the experiment, the researchers found that CAPPSID completely eradicated human lung tumours implanted into the backs of mice, however they didn’t include a control group that only received Senecavirus A.\n\nBefore this can be rolled out to people, further studies in mice and non-human primates should test it against a wider range of tumours, like pancreatic cancer, which has a particularly poor survival rate, says Simpson.",

I’m Arielle.\n\nKarissa\n\nAnd I’m Karissa, and we’re working hard to put solutions in view and optimism in movement.\n\nArielle\n\nHello! We are back with yet another episode of our pod to share the solutions from the Optimist Daily this week. And in case you can’t get enough of us, we definitely recommend that you sign up for our free daily newsletter. That way, you can get all of the solutions that we don’t get to talk about on the pod right into your inbox.\n\nKarissa\n\nYou can also follow us on socials if that’s how you prefer to get our news. We are @OptimistDaily on just about everything, except on X, where we are @OdeToOptimism. So definitely give us a follow if you want your solutions there.\n\nArielle\n\nWe’d also like to send out a really big thank you to all of our Emissaries—people who sign up on our website to support us financially. These are people who donate either just once or monthly or annually—however many times they like. So a huge thank you to you guys.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, we’re a small team, and we need your support. But there are definitely non-financial ways to support the mission of the Optimist Daily. You can share this podcast or the newsletter with a friend, share a social post—anything to get this positive, optimistic news out there and make a difference. So we really appreciate it.\n\nArielle\n\nWell Karissa, how are you doing this week?\n\nKarissa\n\nI am doing well for the most part. Summer is definitely summering, which is good and bad because it’s been really hot, but it’s been nice just to have a little bit of time to decompress. How about you?\n\nArielle\n\nI’m not gonna lie. I’m a little bit under the weather. I’m trying my best to not sound too sick and sniffly on the pod, but excuse me if I sound a bit congested.\n\nKarissa\n\nI feel like there hasn’t been much sickness in a while because it has been warm, so yeah.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, I’m actually grateful that it’s been so long since I’ve been sick. I’m going to take this and run with it. Hopefully I get better soon. I’ve just been making myself chicken noodle soup and chugging ginger lemon honey tea, so yeah, fingers crossed.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah. Hope the healing goes smoothly.\n\nArielle\n\nThank you.\n\nKarissa\n\nBut it kind of sounds like we’re both maybe in a little bit of a brain fog lately. My brain fog is not from being sick, but just like I said, it’s been hot and it’s summer and… that brings me to my “I’m an optimist, but…”\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, go for it.\n\nKarissa\n\nI’m an optimist, but I am not too optimistic about my level of focus lately. I try to give myself a little bit of a pass because it is summer, and I think summer is a good time to kind of step back a little bit and enjoy it, but I just feel like it’s gotten kind of bad. Last week, there was a day I was working and I just feel like I wasn’t even really working—I was just rotting away on my phone. I did get my work done, but it took a lot longer than it needed to.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah.\n\nKarissa\n\nI just feel like I haven’t been able to focus lately. So that’s why when I saw my solution for the week, I was pretty excited. I’ll get into that later. But before I jump into my solution, I want to hear if there’s anything you’re “an optimist, but…” about this week.\n\nArielle\n\nYes. Well, before we get started, I want to give a quick heads-up that my “I’m an optimist, but…” leads me into my solution, and it will touch on topics related to contraception and sexual health and the existence of sex in general. The discussion isn’t graphic at all, but just in case you prefer to skip that kind of content, feel free to jump ahead a few minutes to Karissa’s solution.\n\nWith that said, I’m an optimist, but lately it’s dawned on me that because I’ve been using hormonal birth control for over a decade now, I’m not truly in touch or aware of who I am without the potential side effects the pill has on me. I don’t know if you can relate, Karissa, but I know a lot of my friends have been choosing to stop taking birth control. After a few months of adjusting, they tell me there’s a certain level of self-knowledge about their cycles and their womanhood and their bodies that they never would have known had they continued taking the pill. I feel like I kind of want to experience this as well, but my partner and I definitely don’t want to get pregnant, and it feels too risky to stop birth control altogether. Do you have any feelings about this, Karissa?\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, I mean, I feel like I’m kind of in the exact same boat as you because I’ve been on the birth control pill for over a decade now too. And I have the same feelings like—do I really know who I am without the pill? I’ve been on the exact same brand of the pill, and I remember when I first started, I was also starting college.\n\nArielle\n\nYes.\n\nKarissa\n\nAnd I remember being so depressed that year. I don’t know if part of that was amplified by being on hormonal birth control, because that is one of the side effects. Probably the combination of everything going on and new changes and stuff. But we kind of talked last week about the societal tax of being a woman. It just sucks that we have to be the ones that deal with birth control in order to prevent pregnancies.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, I totally agree. So here’s my big question: why has male birth control been stuck in the condoms-or-the-snip era for decades now?\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, I mean literally that is the big question. Meanwhile, women have had pills, implants, IUDs, shots—the whole pharmacy aisle—and it’s felt pretty one-sided to prevent pregnancies.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah. Even with the non-hormonal ways that you can track your cycle, it’s still all on women to manage that.\n\nKarissa\n\nTotally.\n\nArielle\n\nBut the good news is that maybe that won’t be the case for much longer. That brings me to the title of the article I’m talking about today: First hormone-free male birth control pill shown safe in early trial. The new male birth control pill in question is called YCT-529.\n\nKarissa\n\nOh, so it’s also hormone-free? That’s a pretty big deal. I guess we’re talking about fewer side effects.\n\nArielle\n\nThat’s the hope. Instead of tinkering with testosterone or progestin, this pill targets something totally different. It blocks a vitamin A metabolite from attaching to receptors in the testes.\n\nKarissa\n\nOh, okay. So it stops sperm production at the source.\n\nArielle\n\nExactly—without touching hormones that affect mood, libido, or sexual function.\n\nKarissa\n\nAnd is it reversible?\n\nArielle\n\nYep. You take it, sperm production pauses. You stop, fertility gradually comes back. But this first trial wasn’t necessarily to prove it works as birth control yet—it was just about safety and how the body processes the drug.\n\nKarissa\n\nOkay. So who signed up for this trial?\n\nArielle\n\nSixteen healthy men aged 32 to 59. And here’s the clever part—they’d all had vasectomies, so even if something unexpected happened, there was zero risk of an accidental pregnancy.\n\nKarissa\n\nAh, built-in safeguard. That’s pretty clever.\n\nArielle\n\nMm-hmm. They split the participants into groups—smaller doses for some, larger doses for others—and a few tested what happens if you take the pill after a high-fat breakfast.\n\nKarissa\n\nAnd what were the results of that?\n\nArielle\n\nThe pill was well tolerated, no side effects linked to the drug. Nadja Mannowetz, the Chief Science Officer at YourChoice Therapeutics, said they saw good and quick bioavailability. Blood levels dropped by half in two to three days, which means this could become a once-a-day pill.\n\nKarissa\n\nOkay, so the safety is looking good. And what about actually lowering sperm count, since that’s important?\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, that’s what they’re testing now in efficacy trials. Mannowetz thinks the final dose will probably be closer to the higher end they tested—about 180 milligrams.\n\nKarissa\n\nI see. And are there other players in this race?\n\nArielle\n\nOh yeah. There’s NES/T—that’s N-E-S forward-slash T. It’s a daily gel with testosterone and progestin that you rub on your shoulders and arms. And then there’s ADAM, a non-hormonal hydrogel implant that temporarily blocks the vas deferens, like a reversible vasectomy.\n\nKarissa\n\nOh, okay. Well, good to see there will probably be some options. I feel like if any of these actually do end up hitting the market, there’s going to be a lot of interest.\n\nArielle\n\nThe surveys agree. In 2023, 75 percent of more than 2,000 men in the U.S. and Canada said they’d be open to trying new male birth control. And a 2019 study found nearly half of sexually active men aged 18 to 49—not trying to conceive—said they’d be very interested.\n\nKarissa\n\nWell, that’s huge.\n\nArielle\n\nStephanie Page, an endocrinologist at the University of Washington, put it perfectly: “Men are very eager to have more reproductive agency and to participate in contraception.”\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, that’s great news. Even if one of these works out, it could completely shift how responsibility is shared.\n\nArielle\n\nExactly. The goal is a future where contraception is truly a partnership—not something one side carries alone. And I know my partner would definitely be interested. (laughs)\n\nKarissa\n\nMine too!\n\nArielle\n\nIf you want to look more into this study, it was published in the journal Communications Medicine and the title is Safety and pharmacokinetics of the non-hormonal male contraceptive YCT-529.\n\nKarissa\n\nAwesome. Yeah, this is great. And any form of birth control isn’t 100 percent—it’s close—but I think having that double protection will be even better for people looking to prevent pregnancy at the moment or always.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah. And it’s a lot less… less of a commitment than getting the snip.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nArielle\n\nAll right. Well, I’m curious to see how your lack of focus will connect to your solution today, Karissa.\n\nKarissa\n\nSo lately I’ve been really trying to reinforce the theme in my life of staying consistent and focused on my goals, and I was taking a look at my vision board for the year earlier today that just hangs over my desk. And there’s so much about like focus and consistency on there. So I know that that’s something I wanted to work on a lot this year and just like in yoga lately too, because we often set intentions during our practice where we think of a word or a mantra, I just find myself choosing presence and focus a lot. So that’s why I was really pleased to see this interesting solution that is titled How to build a one-minute daily health check-in that actually sticks.\n\nBecause I mean, life often runs at full speed, and our own well-being can just get lost in the shuffle. So a daily check-in, even one that just takes a minute, it creates a pause to reconnect with yourself. You can kind of think of it as a daily reset button that will help you notice how you feel. Recognize early signs of stress and make small adjustments before burnout sets in.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah. Well, I think your plight is really relatable. I know that I can definitely relate. And this solution honestly sounds a lot more doable than trying to completely overhaul your wellness routine.\n\nKarissa\n\nA check-in is way less intimidating than larger wellness routines. It doesn’t require creating a perfect schedule or enough mental energy to dive deep.\n\nArielle\n\nRight. And sometimes we can’t control the fact that we didn’t get enough sleep, for instance, or have unexpected things to deal with during the day.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, exactly. So a minute check-in is simply a mindful moment that encourages awareness and small shifts in behavior. And we do all have a spare minute during the day.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, definitely. What should we do during these quick check-ins to really make the most of one minute?\n\nKarissa\n\nThe first step to building any habit is understanding why it matters. Do you want to feel more balanced, to manage energy better, or simply check in on your mental state? Defining your personal reasons makes the habit meaningful rather than just another goal. So you can try to jot down one or two statements that capture why this actually matters to you and this will keep your practice anchored when life gets busy.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, I love this. Intention is certainly key in anything we do. But life does get hectic. So are there any suggestions on the best time of day one can do this check-in?\n\nKarissa\n\nThat brings me to Step 2, which is to pick an actual time slot. A habit is easier to maintain when it fits into your daily rhythm, so choose a time you already pause, like after brushing your teeth, while your coffee is brewing, or before bed. And I was even thinking maybe instead of scrolling on my phone while maybe I’m sitting on the toilet for a long time, I could even do this practice too. So there’s a lot of windows of opportunity for this.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, I’m also thinking of a lot of the opportunities I have during the day where I can incorporate this practice. Maybe on a walk with my dog, for instance, or, you know, organizing or folding laundry.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, exactly. Those are great ideas. But overall consistency is key. So linking the habit to an existing routine makes it easier to remember, and those are definitely things you’re probably doing every day. Step 3 of this little check-in is to create your check-in template because your one-minute practice should be straightforward. So you can decide what you want to reflect on each time. Some examples you can include are: How does my body feel right now? Are there any areas of tension or discomfort? What is my energy level? Is it high or low or somewhere in between? How am I feeling emotionally? What does my body need—hydration, food, rest, or movement? You can choose a few prompts that feel most relevant to you and stick with them to create consistency, which is an overarching theme here.\n\nAnd Step 4 of this is to choose your style because there’s no single right way to do this. You can speak your thoughts aloud, type a quick note, or use a simple checklist too instead of it all just being in your head.\n\nArielle\n\nAh, I didn’t even consider that we could just write this out or make a checklist, but I like these ideas because I’m such a to-do list girl.\n\nKarissa\n\nMe too. Some people even prefer visual cues like emojis to track mood or energy levels, so that’s also a great idea. But the best format, of course, is one that you can sustain. And I guess that brings me to Step 5, which is to keep it simple because the magic of this habit lies in how short and accessible it is. It’s not really about solving every problem or diving into deep reflection. One minute of honest awareness is just enough.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, I guess it’s also a great focusing practice as well. Because you just want to focus on that one thing, which is checking in with yourself.\n\nKarissa\n\nYes, absolutely. And that’s why I need to do this—to practice focus. And on days when you have more time, you could expand the practice if you wanted, as long as you don’t let the longer sessions become a pressure.\n\nStep 6 here is to use it as a guide for your day. So a quick check-in is more than just self-awareness. It’s a tool for decision-making. I mean, if you notice you’re exhausted, you might swap a high-energy workout for a gentle stretch instead. And if stress is building, a few deep breaths or a short walk might help.\n\nStep 7 is to track your effort and note your answers. Instead of analyzing every response, focus on the act of showing up. You can mark a calendar or use a habit tracker to log your one-minute check-ins, and that can build momentum and a sense of accomplishment. So I really like that tip.\n\nAnd Step 8 is to actually personalize your practice. By naming your practice, you can make it feel like your own. So whether you call it a pause minute or a mood check, a personal touch really helps it stick.\n\nAnd Step 9 is to allow it to evolve because some days your check-in will feel insightful and other days it might just feel repetitive. But that’s part of the process.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah. And that’s also just what consistency is. Sometimes it’s boring.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, totally. And you can adapt the questions or timing as your needs change. The goal is simply to keep listening to yourself on a consistent basis.\n\nAnd that brings me to the 10th and final step: Practice this practice with kindness, because a check-in is not a performance or a test. If you discover you’re tired or tense, it’s an opportunity to care for yourself and not judge yourself. You should treat it as you would a conversation with a good friend—honest, curious, and kind.\n\nArielle\n\nThat’s a great reminder. Kindness to ourselves is so important and so overlooked. Well, Karissa, I certainly love these pointers and I am definitely going to try to incorporate this practice into my daily routine.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, me too. I mean, a one-minute check-in might seem small, but over time it builds a powerful sense of self-awareness and balance. And by pausing each day to ask how you feel and what you need, you really create this great habit of listening and responding with care—to yourself and to others, I would say too.\n\nArielle\n\nIt’s a simple yet transformative way to show up for your well-being. Thanks for sharing the solution, Karissa.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, absolutely. I really liked the solution and I really loved the other solutions we shared on the Optimist Daily this week as well.\n\nArielle\n\nYes, and they include Helsinki marks a year without traffic deaths, thanks to slower speeds and smarter streets, Monotasking is the mental reset your brain has been waiting for (and also kind of related to focus), Could flossing be the future of flu shots?, and 7 creative ways to repurpose your old sleeping bag before tossing it. What else do we have, Karissa?\n\nKarissa\n\nNew York becomes first state to mandate all-electric new buildings, Just looking at someone sick may prime your immune system, study finds—I wonder if people’s immunity is being boosted by looking at you, Arielle (laughs) or not—but yeah, that’s a really interesting one so I’d recommend checking out that cool study. We also had Drones reveal record-breaking turtle nesting site in the Amazon and Why spending time in nature boosts brain health, according to a neuroscientist. So a lot of really interesting solutions this week on the Optimist Daily, so go check them out.\n\nArielle\n\nAll right. Well, thank you so much, Karissa, for sharing your time and energy with me. We will be back next week with more solutions—and hopefully I’ll be better by then. In the meantime, I wish all of our listeners and readers a wonderful weekend. And you too, Karissa.\n\nKarissa\n\nYes, and I—and I’m sure everyone else—wish you a speedy recovery. Looking forward to being back with more solutions next week.\n\nArielle\n\nBye!\n\nKarissa",
