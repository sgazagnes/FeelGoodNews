Now I print them out for my daughter\n\n5 hours ago Share Save George Sandeman Share Save\n\nStephen Buffardi Stephen Buffardi, with wife Weena and daughter Sophia, lost thousands of family photos\n\nAs Stephen Buffardi was transferring photos to his new phone, the progress bar reached halfway - then it crashed. Thousands of pictures with friends and family, including early dates with his now wife, were lost forever. \"It was annoying,\" says the 36-year-old, who lives in Massachusetts. He and his wife Weena, 32, now have a six-year-old daughter, Sophia. \"When you have a kid you're like, it would have been nice to have those photos now - to save them for her.\" Sophia will never be able to see the pictures of her parents when they first met. For Stephen, this was a moment of realisation that digital photos don't always stand the test of time. So he decided to start making physical albums for her.\n\nStephen Buffardi Losing so many photos has spurred Stephen into creating physical albums for Sophia\n\nHe's documented her life as a newborn - featuring her hospital tag and ink prints of her tiny feet - as well as one for each year of her childhood so far. And he's currently putting together an album which will show her life as a five-year-old. Earlier this week he ordered 300 photographs to be printed. This is nothing new - people have been compiling photo albums and scrapbooks for more than 100 years. But what should you think about if you want to keep your photos safe? Experts broadly agree you should keep three versions of your most treasured pictures: the original on your phone, one copy online, and one on a hard drive. Some even suggest going one step further - printing them out.\n\nStephen Buffardi Sophia enjoys going through the albums Stephen has made to document her childhood\n\nIn a digital world, preserving information is everyone's problem. Last week the UK government told businesses they should have contingency plans on paper in case of cyber-attacks. And just days ago, a problem with Amazon Web Services disrupted more than 1,000 businesses globally. Christopher Barnatt, a former computing and future studies lecturer and YouTuber, says this is why we should think about making physical copies of all important documents - for example birth certificates, insurance papers and passports. Photos are arguably no different. And there are plenty of tools we can use to protect them. What caused the AWS outage - and why did it make the internet fall apart?\n\nAmazon Web Services outage: Are we relying too much on US big tech? One obvious step is to back them up onto an online cloud service like Apple's iCloud or Google Photos. Smartphones often do this automatically. But there are issues like space and cost. iCloud has a limit of 5GB - which covers photos as well as iPhone backups and other app data. After that, iCloud charges UK users £0.99 per month for up to 50GB of space. Google Photos offers 15GB - shared with the user's Gmail and Google Drive content - before charging. While these services are very stable, they are not totally risk-free. Earlier this year, a woman in North Carolina told the WBTV news outlet her iCloud account was hacked and her password changed. She lost access to her photos and videos and said Apple told her there was nothing they could do about it. You don't have to be hacked though. If you're really unlucky you might forget your password and be unable to restore it - meaning you can't log back into your cloud service.\n\n'I assume the house could burn down'\n\nIt's probably safer to keep your photos on a cloud service than on social media. \"A lot of people use social media almost like a diary. Social media platforms are set up to sort of serialise people's lives and [create] narratives,\" says Dr Esperanza Miyake of the University of Strathclyde, who researches how social media companies treat people's data. In 2019, a server migration by MySpace - which was once the most popular social media platform in the world - resulted in the loss of 12 years' worth of music uploads. They were \"all gone\", says Dr Miyake. The company apologised for the data loss. There can be a cost issue, too. Earlier this month Snapchat announced it would start charging people for storing photos and videos on their messaging app, much to the annoyance of some users. Snapchat said 5GB of storage would remain free, but after that users would be charged $1.99 (£1.48) per month for up to 100GB of space. Prof Winters suggests there will always be a problem with treating commercial platforms as archives. \"They don't have an archival function. They're commercial entities. \"The assumption that we will always be able to keep uploading every single photo we take and have it preserved in perpetuity by a commercial entity is one that's going to be tested.\"\n\nThis is why downloading photos and keeping them on an external device like a hard drive or memory card is a good idea. You shouldn't have to worry about images becoming unreadable for a very long time - thanks to \"robust\" image file formats like jpeg, according to Prof Winters. Many hard drives work for up to 10 years - with some lasting for 20 - so it's important to move your pictures to new hard drives as the decades pass.\n\nThendo Muloiwa Thendo Muloiwa thinks there is a particular joy in sharing physical photo albums\n\nIf you've got your three copies of your photos, you're in a good place. But what about printing them out? Despite the risks of fire, water damage, or simply being misplaced, it's still a genuinely durable way of passing down memories through the generations. Dr Barnatt and Dr Miyake say people who grew up with social media and mobile phones should keep offline copies of their most beloved items. \"It's about valuing what's important to you before it's too late,\" says Prof Winters. If you start thinking about printing out your digital archive too late in life, \"you may have lost the things you value already\". South African Thendo Muloiwa has decided to do just that, at the age of 28. He loves the photo albums his parents made for him when he was a young child and wants to do the same with the digital pictures he has snapped using his phone. They show the places he has been, and the friends he has made during his 20s.\n\nThendo Muloiwa Thendo loves the photo albums his parents made for him when he was a child",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Stephen Buffardi lost thousands of family photos when his phone crashed while transferring images to a new device. Many of these pictures showed important moments, like early dates with his wife, and now can’t be recovered.\n\n**What happened** – After this loss, Stephen decided to start printing physical photo albums for his daughter, Sophia. He has created albums documenting her life from birth, including special keepsakes like her hospital tag and footprints. He recently ordered 300 printed photos to preserve these memories in a way that digital files alone cannot guarantee.\n\n**Impact** – This story shows that relying only on digital photos can be risky because phones can crash, cloud services can be hacked, and online storage may cost money or have limits. Experts recommend keeping three copies of important photos: the original on your phone, a backup online, and a copy on a hard drive. Printing photos is also suggested as a lasting way to protect memories, even though physical copies can face risks like fire or water damage.\n\n**What's next step** – More people may choose to print photo albums along with digital backups to ensure their memories last. Experts advise updating hard drives over time and thinking early about preserving photos before they are lost. This approach helps families keep their stories safe for future generations.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Combining digital backups with printed photo albums offers a stronger way to protect cherished family memories from being lost.\n\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Stephen Buffardi a perdu des milliers de photos de famille lorsque son téléphone a planté en transférant des images vers un nouvel appareil. Beaucoup montraient des moments importants, comme ses premiers rendez-vous avec sa femme, et ne peuvent plus être récupérées.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Après cette perte, Stephen a décidé de commencer à imprimer des albums photo pour sa fille Sophia. Il a créé des albums retraçant sa vie depuis sa naissance, avec des souvenirs spéciaux comme son bracelet d'hôpital et ses empreintes de pieds. Il a récemment commandé 300 photos imprimées pour préserver ces souvenirs d’une façon que les fichiers numériques seuls ne garantissent pas.\n\n**Impact** – Cette histoire montre que se fier uniquement aux photos numériques comporte des risques car les téléphones peuvent tomber en panne, les services en ligne peuvent être piratés, et le stockage peut coûter cher ou être limité. Les experts recommandent de conserver trois copies de ses photos importantes : l’original sur le téléphone, une sauvegarde en ligne, et une copie sur un disque dur. Imprimer les photos est aussi conseillé comme moyen durable de protéger les souvenirs, même si les copies physiques peuvent aussi être endommagées.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – De plus en plus de personnes pourraient choisir d’imprimer des albums photo en plus des sauvegardes numériques pour que leurs souvenirs durent. Les experts recommandent de mettre à jour les disques durs régulièrement et de penser tôt à la conservation des photos avant qu’elles ne soient perdues. Cette méthode aide les familles à garder leurs histoires en sécurité pour les générations futures.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – Associer sauvegardes numériques et albums photo imprimés offre une meilleure protection des souvenirs familiaux précieux.\n\n",
