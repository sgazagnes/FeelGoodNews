      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nWhen New Mexico rolled out its landmark universal child care program, most headlines focused on working parents. But tucked into the policy is a quieter, deeply meaningful change: grandparents who are raising their grandchildren can now access free child care, even if they are retired or no longer in the workforce.\n\nFor thousands of families across the state, this shift is more than a regulatory tweak. It is a recognition of reality.\n\nNew Mexico has the highest rate of grandparents and other relatives caring for children in the nation. Between 2021 and 2023, about eight percent of children in the state were living in kinship care, more than double the national average of three percent. Many of these grandparents stepped in during moments of crisis, often with little warning and limited financial support.\n\nWhy grandparents were previously shut out\n\nIn most states, child care subsidies are tied to work or school requirements. Caregivers must prove they are employed or enrolled in education to qualify. That framework left many grandparents out.\n\nAs state officials gathered input from families over the past two years, the same story surfaced again and again. Grandparents who had taken on parenting roles later in life did not qualify for assistance because they were retired. Many were living on fixed incomes, facing the physical demands of caring for young children, and struggling to cover child care costs that can exceed $13,000 a year.\n\nNew Mexico’s substance abuse crisis has intensified this need. According to the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation, about 16 percent of the state’s adult, non-senior population struggles with substance abuse. In 2021, New Mexico ranked first in alcohol-related deaths and sixth in drug overdose deaths nationwide. These realities have pushed many grandparents into caregiving roles unexpectedly.\n\nAt the same time, roughly one in three grandparents raising grandchildren in the state lives at or below the poverty line.\n\nA policy designed to reflect real families\n\nUnder the new universal child care rules, grandparents with legal custody or kinship guardianship are explicitly exempt from work and school requirements. That change makes them newly eligible for free care.\n\n“We wanted grandparents to see that we see them and that we recognize they are doing hero’s work by taking care of their grandchildren,” said Elizabeth Groginsky, New Mexico’s cabinet secretary for early childhood education.\n\nOther states offer limited exemptions for kinship caregivers. Grace Reef, president of the Early Learning Policy Group, notes that 21 states have some version of this policy. But those exemptions are often buried in complex regulations. New Mexico’s approach stands out for its simplicity and scale.\n\n“New Mexico’s approach is simpler and more universally applicable to grandparents, helping reduce confusion and barriers for grandparents seeking child care access for their family,” said Anne Hedgepeth, senior vice president of policy and research at Child Care Aware of America.\n\nEarly signs of impact\n\nBefore the universal program launched, about 916 children in grandparent-led households received child care assistance in fiscal year 2025. In just the first three weeks of the new system, 61 additional grandparent-headed households were approved for care.\n\nFor advocates and providers, the change is long overdue. Barbara Tedrow, who owns five child care centers in Farmington, said she often felt compelled to waive tuition for grandparents who suddenly found themselves caring for toddlers they could not afford to enroll.\n\n“They were older, and they weren’t working. They were in their 70s taking care of a two-year-old,” Tedrow said. “There was no way they could afford the tuition. So we as providers were normally just letting them come for free.”\n\nTedrow added that consistent care is especially important for children who have already experienced trauma. “Let this child at least stay during their core hours getting fed, getting nurtured, educated, playing with other children their age,” she said. “‘I’m 70. I don’t know where to go find two-year-olds for my granddaughter to play with.’”\n\nWhat grandparents say they really need\n\nJovanna Archuleta, early childhood program director at the LANL Foundation, said grandparents consistently emphasize flexibility. Many do not need full-day care every day. What they need is relief.\n\n“They need respite care,” Archuleta said. “They need drop-in spots and times where they can just have time for themselves.”\n\nOne grandparent quoted in the LANL report described days packed with school drop-offs, meals, laundry, homework, and bedtime routines. “By the way I am 70 and a disabled vet, and a widow,” she wrote.\n\nCaring for young children is demanding at any age. For older adults, it can be even more physically and emotionally exhausting.\n\nThe biggest challenge ahead: capacity\n\nPolicy alone does not create child care slots. New Mexico now faces the challenge of building enough capacity to meet demand.\n\nEven before universal care, about 80 percent of children were eligible for assistance, yet only around 35 percent of eligible children under age five actually received it. Long waitlists, limited provider participation, and a shrinking number of home-based providers have all contributed to gaps.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2025, New Mexico saw registered home-based providers drop from 4,840 to just 821. To meet demand, the state estimates it needs 55 new child care centers and 1,120 additional home-based providers.\n\nTo get there, New Mexico is offering low-interest loans from a $13 million fund to expand or build centers, raising reimbursement rates, and streamlining payments to providers. It has also reduced some barriers for home-based providers, though challenges remain.\n\n“The majority of those families live with extended family or roommates,” said Lucy Leon, a former home-based provider. “From the jump it’s like, ‘There’s no way I’m going to do a background check for my husband, my son, and much less a coworker.’ That’s another great barrier.”\n\nA model with national implications\n\nNew Mexico’s universal child care program is funded through years of preparation, including oil and gas tax revenues and a voter-approved constitutional amendment championed by Latinas in the state. The early childhood fund has grown from $320 million in 2020 to $10 billion today.\n\nAs states like New York and Georgia explore similar proposals, advocates are watching closely. Nationwide, the number of grandparents raising grandchildren has been rising for 25 years, driven in part by the opioid epidemic.\n\n“If we are going to invest a huge amount of money into a universal child care system, let’s hold an ambitious goal for what it delivers to families,” said Natalie Renew, executive director of Home Grown. “I don’t think it’s going to be easy, but I think it is possible.”\n\nFor New Mexico’s grandparents, the message is already clear. The state has acknowledged their role, their sacrifice, and their need for support. And for families built on love rather than paperwork, that recognition matters.\n\nDid this solution stand out?

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – New Mexico has the highest number of grandparents caring for their grandchildren in the United States. Many of these grandparents took on this role suddenly, often without financial help, and struggled to pay for child care because most programs require caregivers to be working or studying.\n\n**What happened** – New Mexico introduced a universal child care program that now allows grandparents with legal custody or guardianship to get free child care without needing to prove they work or go to school. This change started in 2025 and has already helped dozens of grandparent-led families access care.\n\n**Impact** – This policy recognizes the real situation of many families and removes barriers that kept grandparents from getting help. It offers relief to older caregivers who often live on fixed incomes and face physical challenges, allowing children to have stable care and social time with peers. New Mexico’s approach is simpler and more inclusive than many other states.\n\n**What's next step** – New Mexico needs to increase the number of child care providers to meet the growing demand. The state is investing in building new centers, supporting home-based providers, and making payments easier. The program could inspire other states to adopt similar policies for kinship caregivers.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New Mexico’s new child care program helps grandparents raising grandchildren by providing free, accessible care that fits their unique needs.\n\n",

Under this anticipated new framework, EU countries would be able to either create a new corporate form or incorporate EU-wide rules into an existing one. MEPs insist on a single harmonised set of rules known as the “28th regime” to ensure a level playing field for businesses across the EU.\n\nFast digital registration\n\nThis Unified European Company (S.EU) would apply to non-listed limited liability companies based in one of the 27 EU countries. Registration of an S.EU should be fully digital and able to be completed in 48 hours, requiring a minimum paid-in capital of only one euro. To promote the seamless operation of S.EUs within the internal market, including digital communication with authorities and digital information for investors, MEPs want a Commission-operated uniform digital multilingual portal accessible across all EU member states.\n\nAttracting investment and talent\n\nMEPs want to ease access for S.EUs to investment, including via alternative financing models, while ensuring optional protection schemes, such as the separation of voting and economic rights or profit distribution based on contractual agreements limited in time or amount. They also propose rules to attract and retain top talent in S.EUs including via employee stock-ownership plans and employee stock options.\n\nTransfer of knowledge and specialised dispute-resolution\n\nParliament says S.EUs should be able to commercialise fundamental research and calls for measures that would ensure improved cooperation between SMEs, start-ups, scale-ups and research institutions in the EU.
