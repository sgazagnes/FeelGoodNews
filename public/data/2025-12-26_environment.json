      "summary": "A new eco-friendly technology can capture and destroy PFAS, the dangerous “forever chemicals” found worldwide in water. The material works hundreds to thousands of times faster and more efficiently than current filters, even in river water, tap water, and wastewater. After trapping the chemicals, the system safely breaks them down and refreshes itself for reuse. It’s a rare one-two punch against pollution: fast cleanup and sustainable destruction.",
      "content": "A research team at Rice University, working with international collaborators, has created the first environmentally friendly technology that can quickly trap and break down toxic \"forever chemicals\" (PFAS) in water. The results, published recently in Advanced Materials, represent a meaningful advance against one of the most stubborn pollution threats worldwide.\n\nThe project was led by Youngkun Chung, a postdoctoral fellow mentored by Michael S. Wong, a professor at Rice's George R. Brown School of Engineering and Computing. The effort also included Seoktae Kang, a professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), and Keon-Ham Kim, a professor at Pukyung National University in South Korea.\n\nWhat Are PFAS and Why Are They a Problem\n\nPFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are man-made chemicals that date back to the 1940s. They have been used in many everyday products, including Teflon pans, waterproof clothing, and some food packaging. PFAS became popular because they resist heat, grease, and water, but that same durability also means they break down very slowly, which is why they are often called \"forever chemicals.\"\n\nPFAS have now spread widely and can be found in water, soil, and air around the world. Research has linked exposure to liver damage, reproductive disorders, immune system disruption, and certain cancers. Cleanup has been difficult because once PFAS enter the environment, they are hard to remove and even harder to destroy.\n\nWhy Current PFAS Removal Methods Fall Short\n\nMany standard approaches rely on adsorption, meaning the chemicals stick to materials such as activated carbon or ion-exchange resins. These methods are common, but they have major limitations, including low efficiency, slow operation, limited capacity, and the buildup of additional contaminated waste that still has to be handled.\n\n\"Current methods for PFAS removal are too slow, inefficient and create secondary waste,\" said Wong, the Tina and Sunit Patel Professor in Molecular Nanotechnology and professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, chemistry and civil and environmental engineering. \"Our new approach offers a sustainable and highly effective alternative.\"\n\nThe Breakthrough LDH Material That Works Fast\n\nThe new approach is built around a layered double hydroxide (LDH) material made from copper and aluminum. Kim first identified this type of material while he was a graduate student at KAIST in 2021. As the team explored these compounds further, Chung found that a specific version containing nitrate could adsorb PFAS with unusually high performance.\n\n\"To my astonishment, this LDH compound captured PFAS more than 1,000 times better than other materials,\" said Chung, a lead author of the study and now a fellow at Rice's WaTER (Water Technologies, Entrepreneurship and Research) Institute and Sustainability Institute. \"It also worked incredibly fast, removing large amounts of PFAS within minutes, about 100 times faster than commercial carbon filters.\"\n\nResearchers say the impressive results come from the material's internal design. Its ordered copper-aluminum layers, along with small charge imbalances, create a highly favorable surface where PFAS molecules can attach quickly and strongly.\n\nTested in River Water, Tap Water, and Wastewater\n\nTo see how well the system could perform outside the lab, the team tested the LDH material in river water, tap water, and wastewater. Across all three, it remained highly effective. It also performed well in both static tests and continuous-flow setups, pointing to possible use in municipal water treatment systems and industrial cleanup.\n\nClosing the Loop With PFAS Destruction and Reuse\n\nCapturing PFAS is only half the battle since the chemicals still need to be destroyed safely. Working with Rice professors Pedro Alvarez and James Tour, Chung developed a process to thermally decompose PFAS after they are captured on the LDH material. When the PFAS-loaded material was heated with calcium carbonate, the researchers removed more than half of the trapped PFAS without releasing toxic by-products. The same step also regenerated the LDH, making it possible to use the material again.\n\nEarly testing showed the material could go through at least six complete cycles of capture, destruction, and renewal. That makes it the first known eco-friendly, sustainable system for PFAS removal that combines rapid cleanup with repeated reuse.\n\nInternational Collaboration and Research Support\n\n\"We are excited by the potential of this one-of-a-kind LDH-based technology to transform how PFAS-contaminated water sources are treated in the near future,\" Wong said. \"It's the result of an extraordinary international collaboration and the creativity of young researchers.\"\n\nA list of all the researchers involved in this study and their institutional affiliations can be found here.

      "summary": "In recent years, the concept of green leases, lease agreements that formally embed environmental goals,...\nThe post Guest Idea: Sustainable Lease Agreements Can Help Build A Greener Future appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "In recent years, the concept of green leases, lease agreements that formally embed environmental goals, has taken root in commercial real estate. Far from being a simple add-on, a green lease represents a powerful collaboration between landlords and tenants. By aligning incentives around energy efficiency, resource conservation, and sustainability, both parties can reduce costs, curb carbon emissions, and support long-term resilience.\n\nCommercial real estate matters a lot in the fight against climate change: buildings account for a huge share of global greenhouse gas emissions. According to the United Nations Environment Program, the buildings and construction sector—including both residential and commercial structures—accounts for approximately 34 percent of global CO₂ emissions and 32 percent of global energy consumption.\n\nAs more organizations commit to environmental targets, sustainable lease agreements become a central tool in transforming real estate footprints. These green leases are not just good for the planet — they make financial sense: lower utility bills, reduced risk, stronger corporate reputation, and healthier indoor environments are shared benefits.\n\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy\n\nAt the heart of a sustainable lease is a commitment to energy performance. Tenants and landlords can agree to minimum energy standards, for example, requiring a building to be Energy Star certified, LEED O+M (Operations and Maintenance) certified, or to meet a defined electricity consumption target in kilowatt-hours per square foot. By building these requirements into lease language, both parties share responsibility for performance and can incentivize upgrades.\n\nRenewable energy is another pillar. A green lease can require or encourage the installation of rooftop solar panels, procurement of green power via utility programs, or purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs). The lease should clearly spell out who installs and maintains the solar infrastructure, who owns it, how costs are shared, and what happens when the lease ends. Landlords might offer tenants lower rates in exchange for commitment, or tenants could agree to pay a premium tied to their green energy demand.\n\nIncentives also matter. A lease could include retrofit allowances or rent credits tied to energy-saving improvements. For example, if a tenant pays for more efficient HVAC systems, they might receive a rent reduction or cost-sharing from the landlord. These provisions encourage capital investments that reduce energy use over the life of the lease. According to research from the Institute for Market Transformation, green leases have the potential to enable over 17% of site energy savings in office buildings.\n\nWater and Waste Management\n\nSustainable lease agreements should also address water and waste, two resource streams often overlooked in traditional contracts. Tenants and landlords can agree to water efficiency targets, such as installing low-flow faucets, dual-flush toilets, waterless urinals, or collecting greywater for irrigation or toilet flushing. These systems lower utility bills and contribute to conservation.\n\nWaste management is equally crucial. A green lease can establish waste diversion goals, committing both landlord and tenant to recycling, composting, and safe disposal of specialty or hazardous waste. The lease should outline responsibilities, including who sorts, transports, and pays for waste streams, and how progress is measured.\n\nShared responsibility clauses help ensure cooperation. For example, the landlord could provide centralized recycling collection infrastructure and bins, while the tenant agrees to train staff, segregate materials, and report volumes. At the end of tenancy, a tenant might even commit to leaving behind furniture and fixtures for reuse rather than discarding them, reducing landfill waste.\n\nSustainable Fit-Out and Materials\n\nA green lease extends beyond utilities to the very fabric of the space. Sustainable fit-out clauses can require the use of materials with low environmental impact. This includes specifying low-VOC paints, FSC-certified wood, recycled content materials, and products certified with Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). Tenants help maintain healthy indoor air quality and reduce embodied carbon.\n\nPartnership is key. Both parties can develop a Green Fit-Out Guide that covers the selection of materials, energy-efficient lighting, occupancy sensors, daylighting strategies, and waste reduction during construction. This negotiated guide ensures that tenant improvements align with sustainability goals from the outset.\n\nThe lease can include deconstruction or materials reuse provisions at the end of tenancy. Instead of demolishing and discarding everything, tenants might dismantle fittings carefully so materials can be reused or recycled. This model reduces waste, saves money, and supports a circular-economy mindset, embedded in the lease itself.\n\nOperational Data Sharing and Reporting\n\nOne of the most powerful elements of a sustainable lease is data transparency. Tenants and landlords should agree to share regular operational data, including energy and water consumption, waste volumes, and carbon emissions. This data sharing lays the foundation for continuous improvement.\n\nClear reporting helps both sides track performance, benchmark against targets, and adjust behaviors. For example, if energy use spikes unexpectedly, they can investigate and respond. If water diversion rates stagnate, they can retool waste strategies. Transparent reporting also strengthens sustainability reporting for tenants with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals and helps landlords meet regulatory or voluntary green building certifications.\n\nData sharing fosters accountability. Lease clauses can include performance reviews, periodic audits, or incentives and penalties tied to whether targets are met. This encourages both parties to remain committed to environmental goals throughout the lease term. The Green Lease Leaders program, a joint initiative of the U.S. Department of Energy and the Institute for Market Transformation, provides model language and best practices for these provisions.\n\nThe Business Case: Why Green Leases Matter\n\nGreen leases are more than moral or environmental gestures; they are pragmatic business tools. For tenants, lower utility costs, a healthier workspace, and ESG alignment can boost employee satisfaction and brand credibility. For landlords, energy-efficient buildings are more attractive, can command higher rents or lower vacancy rates, and may qualify for tax incentives or green financing.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy estimates that if all leased office buildings executed green leases, the market could reap over $3 billion in annual cost savings while reducing utility bills by up to 22 percent.\n\nSustainable lease agreements can also mitigate risks. As regulations tighten and carbon pricing expands, buildings that already meet greener standards will be better insulated from future costs. Tenants who lock in green energy contracts or efficiency investments through their lease are also hedged against volatility in energy prices.\n\nMake Your Lease Green\n\nSustainable lease agreements represent a forward-looking and collaborative way to reshape how buildings operate. By embedding energy efficiency, water and waste management, sustainable construction, and data transparency into lease documents, landlords and tenants align around shared goals, reducing carbon emissions, cutting costs, and promoting long-term value.\n\nAs climate pressures intensify and sustainability becomes a business imperative, green leases offer a concrete strategy to respond. When both sides commit, they build not just greener spaces, but a more resilient and responsible future. For stakeholders across real estate, business, and environmental advocacy, sustainable lease agreements are an indispensable part of the transition, one lease at a time.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nThis sponsored article was written by Victoria Blake, Marketing Manager at LegalDocs.

      "title": "Recycling Mystery: Pet Food Packaging",
      "summary": "Americans spent $67.8 billion on pet food and treats in 2024. More than 94 million...\nThe post Recycling Mystery: Pet Food Packaging appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "Americans spent $67.8 billion on pet food and treats in 2024. More than 94 million U.S. households now include at least one pet. Whether your best animal friend is a dog, a cat, or a less common companion, you likely have some food packaging you’re looking to recycle.\n\nUnfortunately, the scale of pet food packaging waste is staggering. The Pet Sustainability Coalition estimates that 300 million pounds of pet food and treat packaging waste is generated in the United States each year, and over 99% of it ends up in landfills rather than being recycled. The pet food industry produces an estimated 300 million pounds of plastic waste annually, with most packaging made from non-recyclable or hard-to-recycle materials.\n\nHere’s a helpful guide on the recycling solutions for different pet food containers, and what you can do to make a difference.\n\nThe Environmental Impact\n\nPet food packaging contributes significantly to our environmental footprint. Most dry pet food bags are made of polypropylene (#5 plastic) or multi-layer materials that combine aluminum and plastic, making them challenging for conventional recycling programs to process.\n\nAccording to rePurpose Global, 20 pet food brands have partnered with the organization to recover 2,000 tons of plastic waste from nature; the equivalent of 111 million plastic bottles. These partnerships are financing waste recovery in Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya, and India while creating income streams for over 4,500 waste workers.\n\nThe Pet Sustainability Coalition’s Packaging Pledge, commits signatory companies to transition to 100% recyclable, reusable, or compostable packaging. The first companies to join included Open Farm, Primal Pet Foods, Stella and Chewy’s, Canidae, Earth Animal, and Instinct.\n\nCans\n\nWet dog and cat food usually comes in steel cans, and steel is the most commonly recycled material in the U.S. This is the same material used for soup and coffee cans, so if you can recycle those in your community, pet food cans will also be accepted.\n\nCanned foods are lined with Bisphenol A, or BPA, which prevents the metal from corroding and preserves the food. BPA has been linked to health risks in human children, but it won’t impact the recyclability of the can, as the liner is burned off during recycling.\n\nHow to recycle cans: Rinse empty cans and place them in your curbside recycling bin. Most municipalities accept steel and aluminum pet food cans with other metal containers.\n\nBags\n\nMany pet owners buy dry pet food in bags. Not only is it less expensive, but the larger sizes save shopping time and money. Dry food used to be packaged in multi-wall paper bags, which were a more durable form of paper bags you’d find at the grocery store.\n\nThe industry has shifted to polypropylene composite bags because they’re more durable than paper. Although the bags may look like paper, if you try to tear them, you’ll quickly realize they’re not. Many bags are also made of multiple layers that combine plastic, aluminum, and other materials to preserve freshness and prevent moisture damage.\n\nWhile polypropylene is commonly used for everything from laundry baskets to yogurt containers to reusable bags, the recycling market for polypropylene bags is limited. It’s unlikely they will be accepted in your curbside program, and grocery stores that accept plastic bags only want polyethylene bags (resins #2 and #4).\n\nBrand Recycling Programs\n\nSeveral pet food manufacturers have partnered with TerraCycle to offer free mail-in recycling programs for their flexible packaging. Here are the current options.\n\nFree TerraCycle Partnership Programs\n\nWellness Pet Food Complete Health, CORE, and Holistic Select bags and pouches Join Open Farm All flexible pet food packaging Join Royal Canin Royal Canin and Eukanuba flexible packaging Join Halo Pet Food All Halo flexible pet food packaging Join I and Love and You Flexible pet food packaging (cans and boxes recyclable curbside) Join Earthborn Holistic Earthborn Holistic, Venture, and Unrefined bags Join A Pup Above All pet food packaging Join Nulo Challenger Nulo Challenger pet food bags Join Portland Pet Food Company Pet food packaging Join\n\nHow it works: Create a free TerraCycle account, join the brand program, collect empty packaging (no need to wash), and download a free shipping label to mail your recyclables. Many programs also allow you to find or become a public drop-off location.\n\nEarthborn Holistic’s ReBorn program celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2025, having recycled over 2 million pet food bags and diverted more than 260,000 pounds of packaging from landfills.\n\nRetail Drop-Off Programs\n\nPetSmart: In partnership with TerraCycle and brand sponsors (Tiki Cat, Hill’s, Authority, Royal Canin, Canidae, and Simply Nourish), PetSmart offers in-store recycling for all brands of pet food, treats, and litter bags at select locations in Arizona and New Jersey, which are piloting the effort. Look for the TerraCycle collection box in-store.\n\nPet Supplies Plus & Wag N’ Wash: These retailers have partnered with TerraCycle to accept pet food, treat, and litter bags from all brands at participating locations nationwide. No TerraCycle account is needed, just drop off your empty bags.\n\nPaid Option: TerraCycle Zero Waste Box\n\nIf your preferred brand doesn’t have a free program, you can purchase a Pet Food Packaging Zero Waste Box from TerraCycle. The smallest box starts at $134, but you can share the cost with neighbors, your apartment building, or a community group. This option accepts packaging from any brand.\n\nOther Packaging\n\nPouches and Treat Packaging\n\nIf you buy pet snacks and treats, they usually come in plastic pouches. These are primarily polyethylene but contain other materials, so they don’t belong in grocery store bag recycling bins. Check if your treat brand participates in a TerraCycle program. If not, you’ll need to purchase a Zero Waste Box or these items will need to go in the trash.\n\nSome treat companies are innovating: Mars Petcare has expanded its use of compostable M&M’s-style packaging to pet treats in some markets, and several brands are testing compostable films for treats.\n\nFish Food\n\nFish food usually comes in a plastic container. Even though it doesn’t look like a bottle or contain a neck, this product is recyclable with other #1 plastic bottles if your local program accepts them. You may need to remove the cap and either discard or recycle it separately, depending on your local program.\n\nPackaging Innovations\n\nThe pet food industry is actively developing more sustainable packaging options.\n\nPaper-based alternatives: German pet food startup Wynn Petfood recently announced it will switch its packaging to 100% paper, using Koehler Paper’s NexFlex barrier paper technology—a first for wet food blends. Phoenix Bark uses compostable parchment sheets and recyclable paper sleeves.\n\nRecyclable mono-materials: TC Transcontinental Packaging has invested in Biaxially Oriented Polyethylene (BOPE) technology, creating fully recyclable mono-material packaging. Their VieVERTe product line includes recyclable mono-material films that are under review by How2Recycle.\n\nPost-consumer recycled content: Mars Petcare launched 60% post-consumer recycled (PCR) pouches for its Schmackos brand in Australia, eliminating 350 tons of plastic by transitioning its Whiskas cat food from pots to pouches. Nestlé Purina reports that about 80% of its packaging is currently recyclable.\n\nPFAS-free options: UPM Specialty Papers has developed grease-resistant packaging paper that achieves barrier properties without PFAS “forever chemicals,” making them recyclable in existing fiber recycling streams.\n\nExtended Producer Responsibility: What’s Next\n\nAs of October 2025, seven states have enacted comprehensive extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws focused on packaging: California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington. These laws require companies that sell products in packaging to help fund collection, sorting, and recycling systems.\n\nFor pet food manufacturers, this means:\n\nPackaging choices will increasingly factor in recyclability and compliance costs\n\nFlexible bags and pouches face different realities than aluminum cans\n\nCalifornia’s SB 54 sets 2032 targets and will raise $5 billion over 10 years for recycling infrastructure.\n\nMultiple additional states introduced EPR bills in 2025, including New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Illinois, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Hawaii—signaling that this regulatory approach is gaining momentum\n\nEditor’s Note: Originally published on May 11, 2018, this article was most recently updated in December 2025.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Americans spend nearly $68 billion on pet food each year, with more than 94 million households owning pets. This leads to a huge amount of pet food packaging waste, most of which currently ends up in landfills.\n\n**What happened** – Pet food packaging creates about 300 million pounds of plastic waste annually in the U.S., with over 99% not recycled. Many pet food companies have joined efforts like the Pet Sustainability Coalition’s Packaging Pledge and partnered with recycling programs such as TerraCycle to recover and recycle packaging. Some retailers offer drop-off recycling for pet food bags, and new packaging technologies are being developed to make containers recyclable or compostable.\n\n**Impact** – These efforts are important because pet food packaging is often made from difficult-to-recycle materials like mixed plastics and aluminum layers. By switching to recyclable packaging and creating special recycling programs, companies are reducing plastic waste and helping workers in countries like Colombia and India recover plastics from nature. New laws in several states are also requiring companies to take responsibility for packaging recycling, which will encourage more sustainable packaging choices.\n\n**What's next step** – More states are passing laws that make producers responsible for recycling their packaging. This will likely push the pet food industry to use more recyclable materials and support recycling programs. Meanwhile, new packaging technologies like paper-based bags and recyclable plastic films are being tested and could become common. Consumers can help by using brand recycling programs or retailer drop-off points.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Pet food companies and new laws are working together to reduce plastic waste by improving packaging recyclability and supporting specialized recycling programs.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les Américains dépensent près de 68 milliards de dollars par an en aliments pour animaux, avec plus de 94 millions de foyers possédant des animaux de compagnie. Cela génère une énorme quantité de déchets d'emballages, dont la plupart finissent en décharge.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Les emballages pour aliments pour animaux produisent environ 300 millions de livres de déchets plastiques par an aux États-Unis, dont plus de 99 % ne sont pas recyclés. De nombreuses entreprises ont rejoint des initiatives comme l'Engagement pour l'emballage durable et collaborent avec des programmes de recyclage comme TerraCycle. Certains magasins proposent des points de collecte pour recycler les sacs, et de nouvelles technologies d'emballage sont développées pour rendre les contenants recyclables ou compostables.\n\n**Impact** – Ces actions sont importantes car les emballages pour animaux sont souvent faits de matériaux difficiles à recycler, comme des plastiques mélangés et des couches d'aluminium. En adoptant des emballages recyclables et en créant des programmes spécifiques, les entreprises réduisent les déchets plastiques et aident des travailleurs dans des pays comme la Colombie et l'Inde à récupérer du plastique dans la nature. De nouvelles lois dans plusieurs États obligent aussi les fabricants à prendre en charge le recyclage, encourageant ainsi des choix plus durables.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – D'autres États adoptent des lois rendant les producteurs responsables du recyclage de leurs emballages. Cela poussera probablement l'industrie à utiliser plus de matériaux recyclables et à soutenir les programmes de recyclage. Parallèlement, de nouvelles technologies comme les sacs en papier ou les films plastiques recyclables sont testées et pourraient se généraliser. Les consommateurs peuvent aider en utilisant les programmes de recyclage des marques ou les points de dépôt en magasin.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Les entreprises d'aliments pour animaux et les nouvelles lois collaborent pour réduire les déchets plastiques grâce à des emballages plus recyclables et des programmes de recyclage spécialisés.\n",

      "content": "I have no regrets - What to do with unwanted Christmas presents\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Sophia Cobby Share Save\n\nRichard Wilson Dawn-Maria France is an advocate for regifting and says it's the perfect way to declutter her home\n\nMost of us have received at least one Christms present that missed the mark - a jumper that doesn't fit, a hideous ornament or a perfume you don't like. Not every present is greeted with delight - so instead of banishing them to the back of a cupboard, how can you get rid of them without causing offence?\n\n1. Regift\n\nGetty Images\n\nFor Dawn-Maria France from North Yorkshire, the solution to unwanted gifts is simple - pass them on to someone else. She says right after Christmas is the perfect time. She never feels any guilt for doing so and believes it is a more sustainable way of celebrating the festive season. \"One year I was given some garden seeds that I had no use for,\" she says. Rather than letting them go to waste, Dawn-Maria re-gifted them to a green-fingered friend. \"It's a budget-friendly way to manage spending, especially during the cost-of-living crisis, and it's helped me declutter my home,\" she adds. The habit could also help tackle a much bigger problem. Each year, an estimated £42m worth of unwanted presents are thrown away in the UK, with some ending up in landfill. Dawn-Maria re-wrapped her garden seeds adding a personalised note hinting that it was a regift. \"I was given this but I knew you'd love it,\" she wrote. \"It promotes sustainability,\" she says. \"I have no regrets about regifting\".\n\n2. Hide the evidence\n\nAntoinette Akanji The original gifter mustn't risk crossing paths with the new recipient of the gift, says etiquette expert Antoinette Akanji's\n\nSo how do you regift without causing offence? \"Don't get caught out,\" warns Louise Minchin, who presents the BBC's Rip Off Britain programme, advising regifters to remove any labels or notes that might be addressed to someone else. Before re-wrapping she recommends inspecting the gift carefully to make sure no seals have been broken or show signs of wear. If it's been opened or is part of an incomplete set, it's a clear giveaway the item isn't new. \"I've been caught out,\" admits BBC Radio 2's Reverend Kate Bottley who forgot to check there wasn't a card inside a gift she passed on. \"They opened it and I said 'Oh no, I'm so sorry,'\" she recalls. It's enough to make both parties cringe. The BBC's Morning Live regular Dr Oscar remembers being handed a box of chocolates with the message \"Dear Mrs Smith, Thanks for being my teacher this year\". It didn't stop him regifting though, \"I just took the label off for the next one,\" he says. Etiquette expert Antoinette Akanji's has another golden rule: regift outside your social circle. \"If your aunt has given you a jumper that you didn't like, do not regift this to your cousin,\" she says. \"She may see your cousin wearing it and this could provoke an awkward conversation.\" \"You need to ensure that the original giver and the new recipient aren't likely to cross paths.\"\n\n3. Resell\n\nKirsty Quinn\n\nKirsty Quinn, 36 from Oxfordshire says she makes about £500 a month reselling items sourced from car boot sales and charity shops on eBay and Vinted. \"I think if you receive a gift that you're not going to use or don't like, and it's likely to just sit in a drawer or even end up in landfill, then I don't see the harm in re-gifting...or selling it online,\" she says. \"Selling unwanted gifts can help someone else get something they want at a cheaper price, which feels especially relevant given how tough the economy is at the moment,\" she adds. \"It also means the seller can put that money towards something they actually need, something that improves their life, or something they'll truly use. To me, that feels more practical and sustainable than letting items go to waste.\" Vinted says the first Sunday of each year sees a spike in listings of unwanted gifts - averaging three times the normal daily rate Last year's top-listed items women's toiletries and perfumes, jewellery, nightwear and make-up, according to the platform. Fashion dominated the most-bought items after Christmas closely followed by entertainment and electronics, Vinted says. Vinted's tips for reselling presents without offending the person who bought them include using a username that is not easily identifiable and keeping the background of photos neutral. \"Many members will however choose to regift openly, and will include phrases like 'unwanted gift' in their item description,\" a Vinted spokesperson says. \"This often helps buyers better understand the condition of the item.\"\n\n4. Donate\n\nGetty Images\n\nIf regifting doesn't feel right there are plenty of other ways to pass on the joy, says Louise. Donating to charity is an obvious option - and one that can make a real difference. Charity shops eagerly await the post-christmas clear-out, when unwanted gifts become someone else's treasure. This is also echoed by Allison Swaine-Hughes, retail director at the British Heart Foundation. \"If you have decorations that didn't quite fit your theme, a board game you've been gifted twice, or a Christmas jumper that's no longer your colour, why not let them brighten someone else's home or wardrobe by donating them to us?\" And it's not about just donating - shopping in charity shops over Christmas can make a difference too. \"Our stores are full of unexpected treasures - quality items just waiting to find loving new homes,\" she says. If you're worried a relative might stumble across the item they'd bought you while they bargain hunt you can always donate to a charity shop outside of your local area.\n\n5. Include a gift receipt",
