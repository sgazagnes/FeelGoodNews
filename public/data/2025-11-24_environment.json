      "summary": "Researchers taught young loggerhead turtles to associate certain magnetic fields with feeding, prompting a distinctive dance when they recognized the signal. After a magnetic pulse briefly disrupted their ability to feel magnetic forces, the turtles no longer performed the dance. This showed that hatchlings use a touch-based magnetic sense to determine their location. The discovery clarifies how these animals find their way across vast ocean routes.",
      "content": "Loggerhead turtles are equipped with two different abilities for sensing the Earth's magnetic field, yet scientists had not determined which one they rely on to interpret the magnetic map they inherit at birth. New findings from researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published in Journal of Experimental Biology, show that hatchlings use their ability to feel magnetic forces to determine their position along their long migration routes.\n\nAs soon as they leave the beach where they hatch, young loggerheads begin journeys that span thousands of kilometers and can continue for decades. Even at this early stage of life, they are not traveling blindly. Hatchlings come equipped with a magnetic compass that helps them maintain direction, and a magnetic map that provides location information essential for successful navigation.\n\nTwo Ways Animals Detect Earth's Magnetism\n\nScientists understand that animals can sense magnetic fields in two general ways. One possibility involves light-sensitive molecules that respond to magnetic conditions and could allow the animal to see magnetic patterns. The other involves small magnetite crystals within the body that shift in response to magnetic forces, which would allow the animal to feel the field. Until recently, it remained unclear which of these two systems allows loggerhead hatchlings to determine where they are in the vast ocean, and the research team set out to investigate.\n\nEarlier work by Kayla Goforth, Catherine Lohmann, Ken Lohmann and their colleagues showed that hatchling loggerheads can learn to associate a specific magnetic field with the arrival of food. Instead of producing a reflex like Pavlov's dogs, the turtles respond with an energetic \"dance.\" They raise part of their bodies above the water, open their mouths and move their front flippers in an excited pattern.\n\nBy feeding the hatchlings while placing them in a particular magnetic field, the researchers trained them to perform this dance whenever they later encountered that same magnetic signature.\n\nUsing Magnetic Pulses to Test Turtle Senses\n\n\"They are very food motivated and eager to dance when they think there is a possibility of being fed,\" says Alayna Mackiewicz of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe research team realized that this trained behavior could help determine which magnetic sense the turtles were using. They exposed the hatchlings to a strong magnetic pulse, which temporarily interfered with the turtles' ability to feel magnetic forces. If the turtles stopped dancing afterward, it would indicate that they normally use a touch-based magnetic sense. If they continued dancing, it would suggest they rely on a different type of magnetic detection.\n\nTraining the turtles required patience. \"It's really fun but takes up quite a bit of time,\" says Mackiewicz, who, along with Dana Lim (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), spent 2 months feeding 8 newly hatched loggerheads while exposing them to the magnetic field found around the Turks and Caicos islands. This ensured the turtles would learn to dance when they later encountered that same field. They also trained another group of hatchlings to recognise the magnetic field near Haiti.\n\nEach turtle was then placed in a large metal coil that emitted a strong magnetic pulse designed to temporarily disrupt its ability to feel magnetic forces. Afterward, the researchers moved the hatchlings into the magnetic field they had been trained to recognize to see whether they would dance.\n\nEvidence That Hatchlings Rely on Magnetic Touch\n\nAfter exposure to the pulse, the hatchlings danced less often, providing evidence that they use a feel-based magnetic sense to determine their location on their inherited map rather than relying on vision.\n\nThe researchers note that hatchlings may use additional cues to understand where they are in the ocean, but the ability to feel the Earth's magnetic field clearly plays a central role.\n\nThe young turtles are also known to use another magnetic sense that may allow them to see magnetic fields, which helps them determine direction. Taken together, the two abilities complement each other and help hatchlings understand both where they are and which way they should travel during their remarkable migration.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nBrazil, a country at the heart of the world’s climate future, has taken a major step by creating 10 newly recognized Indigenous territories. The announcement came at a moment of heightened emotions and protests both inside and outside the COP30 conference, underscoring how deeply land rights and climate justice are intertwined.\n\nThese new territories, which span parts of the Amazon and several other regions, will receive legal protection for their ecosystems and cultures. Although enforcement of such protections has historically been inconsistent, the designation marks the first expansion of Indigenous lands since President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office. His administration recognized 11 territories last year, signaling a shift from the previous government’s policies.\n\nFor many Indigenous leaders, this progress is long overdue. “Each and every Indigenous territory in Brazil is a reason to celebrate,” said Dinaman Tuxá of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB). “If you demarcate Indigenous lands, you guarantee this area will be protected.”\n\nRestoring lands, protecting biodiversity\n\nThe announcement reflects a growing body of evidence showing that Indigenous stewardship is one of the strongest safeguards against deforestation. Tuxá points out that Indigenous communities protect 82 percent of the planet’s biodiversity, crediting their traditional ways of life with keeping ecosystems intact.\n\nResearch backs this up. A recent study from APIB, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, and the Indigenous Climate Change Committee found that expanding Brazil’s Indigenous territories could prevent up to 20 percent of additional deforestation and cut carbon emissions by 26 percent by 2030.\n\nThe newly designated territories span hundreds of thousands of hectares and are home to several Indigenous peoples, including the Mura, Pataxó, Munduruku, Guarani-Kaiowá, Tupinambá de Olivença, Pankará, and Guarani-Mbya. One of the territories overlaps with more than 78 percent of the Amazon National Park, one of the rainforest’s most biodiverse and climate-critical regions.\n\nTension and tragedy alongside progress\n\nDespite this moment of celebration, the atmosphere around COP30 was fraught. Thousands protested outside the summit over the weekend, with many holding signs reading “demarcation now.” Last week, demonstrators, among them Indigenous leaders, broke into the venue to protest the perceived slow pace of land protections.\n\nHeightened security followed, with more armed soldiers and police stationed around the conference grounds. More than 200 human rights organizations sent a letter to UN officials criticizing the increased militarization, warning that it reflects “a global trend towards the silencing of dissent.”\n\nFor communities on the front lines, the urgency is far from abstract. On Sunday November 16th, an Indigenous leader from the Guarani Kaiowá community was killed in a violent attack, according to Survival International. Vicente Fernandes Vilhalva, 36, was reportedly shot during an assault on the village by armed men. Such violence underscores the risks many face when defending their ancestral lands.\n\nGrowing Indigenous presence inside COP30\n\nDespite tensions at the entrance, COP30 saw the highest number of Indigenous representatives in the summit’s history. “This makes me very happy,” said Kleber Karipuna from APIB. “We worked for two years and now we have at least 900 people inside the COP where they can negotiate and represent their communities.”\n\nFor many, the increased visibility is a crucial shift. Past administrations often sidelined Indigenous voices; today, they were front and center in discussions about climate solutions, biodiversity protection, and land rights.\n\nA turning point for Brazil’s climate future\n\nBefore Lula’s return to office, no new Indigenous lands had been formally recognized since 2018. Under former president Jair Bolsonaro, mining and commercial agriculture encroached deeper into protected areas, and existing rights were often ignored. Lula’s government has already taken steps to remove illegal miners, one of the region’s most destructive forces.\n\nCurrently, Indigenous lands make up 117.4 million hectares, which amounts to roughly 13.8 percent of Brazil’s territory, or about the size of Colombia. These areas are essential to protecting the Amazon, which is nearing a dangerous tipping point as deforestation and climate impacts accelerate.\n\nAs world leaders meet to keep global warming well below two degrees Celsius, Brazil’s actions carry global significance. Thick, healthy forests draw carbon out of the atmosphere; weakened ones release it back. Protecting Indigenous territories isn’t just a local issue; it’s one of the most powerful climate strategies available.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nThe designation of the 10 new territories will be formalized through a presidential decree, but enforcement remains a challenge. The hope among Indigenous communities and conservationists is that these commitments translate into real protection on the ground.\n\nStill, many see this as a moment of real possibility. As Tuxá put it, Indigenous land rights are not just cultural or territorial; they are instrumental to tackling the climate crisis. “The entire humanity benefits from it,” he said.",
