      "content": "We invited a man into our home at Christmas and he stayed with us for 45 years\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Charlie Buckland BBC Wales Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nChristmas is often regarded as a time for goodwill, but one young couple's act of kindness 50 years ago changed their lives forever. On 23 December 1975, Rob Parsons and his wife Dianne were preparing for Christmas at their Cardiff home when they heard a knock at the door. On their doorstep stood a man with a bin bag containing his possessions in his right hand and a frozen chicken in his left. Rob studied the man's face and vaguely remembered him as Ronnie Lockwood, someone he would occasionally see at Sunday School as a boy and who he was told to be kind to as he was a \"bit different\". \"I said 'Ronnie, what's with the chicken?' He said 'somebody gave it to me for Christmas'. And then I said two words that changed all of our lives. \"And I'm not exactly sure why I said them. I said come in.\"\n\nAged just 27 and 26 years old at the time, the couple felt compelled to take Ronnie, who was autistic, under their wing. They cooked his chicken, let him bathe and agreed to let him stay for Christmas. What began as an act of compassion turned into an unique companionship of love and compromise that lasted 45 years, until the day Ronnie died.\n\nRob and Dianne Parsons say Ronnie \"enriched their lives\" and they couldn't imagine doing it all without him\n\nRob, now 77, and Dianne, now 76, had only been married for four years when they welcomed Ronnie into their home. Ronnie was then almost 30 and had been without a home from the age of 15, living in and around Cardiff and moving from job to job - Rob would sometimes see him at a youth club he ran. To make him feel as welcome as possible, they asked their family to bring him a gift for Christmas, anything from a pair of socks to some \"smellies\". \"I can remember him now. He was sat at the Christmas table and he had these presents and he cried because he'd never known that sort of feeling of love, you know,\" said Dianne. \"It was incredible, really, to watch.\"\n\nRob Parsons Ronnie, pictured with Rob and Dianne's son Lloyd at Christmas, was very hands on in helping out with the children and would often say \"I'm good with kids I am\"\n\nThe pair planned to let him stay until the day after Christmas, but when the day came, they couldn't bring themselves to cast Ronnie out and sought advice from the authorities. The homeless centre told them Ronnie needed an address to get a job, Rob said, but \"to get an address, you need a job\". \"That's the Catch 22 that loads of homeless people are in.\"\n\nRob Parsons Ronnie Lockwood had autism and was left homeless after being ejected from a care centre at the age of 15\n\nPut in a care home when he was just eight years old, Ronnie disappeared from Cardiff aged 11, said Rob, and it was only when he was researching for his book, A Knock on the Door, did he discover what happened to him. He had been sent 200 miles away to a school which was referred to in a report as a \"school for subnormal boys\" and he lived there for five years. \"He didn't have any friends there. He had no social worker that knew him. He had no teachers that knew him.\" Rob said Ronnie would often ask \"have I done a bad thing?\" something which they believe he picked up from his time at the school. \"He was always worried he had offended you, or done something wrong.\" Aged 15, Ronnie was sent back to Cardiff \"to nothing\" they said.\n\nRob and Dianne Parsons Dianne says Ronnie \"came into his own\" helping out with the children when she was suffering with chronic fatigue syndrome ME\n\nThe couple said Ronnie was a bit awkward to begin with as he would struggle to make any eye contact and conversation was kept to a minimum. \"But then we got to know him and, in truth, we got to love him,\" they said. They helped Ronnie get a job as a waste collector and took him to buy new clothes after finding out he wore the same clothes he was given as a teenager at the school. \"We didn't have kids of our own, it was like dressing your kids for school, we were proud parents,\" said Rob. \"As we came out of the shop, she [Dianne] said to me: 'He's got a job as a dustman, we've dressed him up as though he's the front man of the Dorchester Hotel',\" Rob laughed.\n\nRob, who was a lawyer, would get up an extra hour early to drop Ronnie to work before going to work himself. When he would get home, Rob said Ronnie would often be sitting there, just smiling, and one night he asked: \"Ronnie, what's amusing you so much?\" Ronnie replied: \"Rob, when you take me to work in the mornings, the other men say 'who is that who brings you to work in that car?' And I say 'oh that's my solicitor'. \"We don't think he was proud of being taken to work by a lawyer, but we think maybe he never had somebody take him on his first day of school,\" said Rob. \"And now he's almost 30... at last somebody is at the gate.\"\n\nRob Parsons Rob and Dianne pictured with Ronnie (right) and their two children, Lloyd and Katie in 1988\n\nRonnie had many rituals they became accustomed to, including emptying the dishwasher each morning, to which Rob would act surprised to avoid Ronnie's disappointment. \"It's hard to look surprised when you get the same question on Tuesday that you had on Monday, but that was Ronnie. \"We did that for 45 years,\" he laughed. \"He obviously struggled to read and write, but he would buy the South Wales Echo every day,\" Dianne added. Ronnie would buy them the same Marks and Spencer gift cards every Christmas but each year he held the same excitement for their reaction.\n\nRob Parsons Rob and Dianne, pictured here in their early 20s, went on to have two children and five grandchildren\n\nRonnie spent a lot of his spare time at their local church, gathering donations for the homeless and setting up for services, \"meticulously\" lining out the chairs. Dianne recalled one day he came home with a different pair of shoes on, and she asked: \"Ronnie, where are your shoes.\" He told her a homeless man needed them. \"That's the type of person he was. He was amazing,\" they said. One of their lowest times was when Dianne was ill with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, as she recalled there being days where she couldn't get out of bed. \"I had a little three-year-old daughter, Rob was away working,\" said Dianne. But she said Ronnie was \"remarkable\" and came into his own, making milk bottles for their son Lloyd, helping out around the home and playing with their daughter Katie.\n\nRob and Dianne Parsons \"[Ronnie] was there before they came and he was there when they were gone with children of their own,\" says Rob\n\nWhile they admitted the dynamic had its difficulties, including battling Ronnie's gambling addiction for 20 years, they couldn't imagine their lives without him. \"It's not something I would recommend as a strategy,\" said Rob, \"but Ronnie enriched our lives in many ways\". \"He had a great heart Ronnie. He was kind, he was frustrating,\" said Dianne. \"Sometimes I was his mother, sometimes I was his social worker and sometimes I was his carer. \"Somebody said to them [their children] one day, 'how did you cope with Ronnie when your friends came to the house' and they said 'well, we don't think about it really, it's just Ronnie'.\" Rob added: \"Our kids had never ever known life without Ronnie. He was there before they came and he was there when they were gone, with children of their own.\"\n\nRob Parsons Ronnie regularly volunteered at the food bank at their local church and helped manage a Boxing Day football match every year for 25 years\n\nOnly once did the couple consider supporting Ronnie to live independently, a few years after he moved in. As their two children were growing older and space felt limited in their one-bathroom home, they approached Ronnie's room to suggest him getting a flat down the road from them. But as they entered, he repeated that familiar question: \"Have I done a bad thing?\" Rob said Dianne hushed him out of the room, burst into tears and said \"I can't do it.\" A few nights later, Ronnie entered their room and asked: \"We three are firm friends, aren't we?\" \"I said 'yes Ronnie, we three are firm friends',\" said Rob. \"And we will be together forever won't we?\" he asked. \"And there was a moment's pause, probably too long, I looked across to Di and I said 'yes Ronnie, we will be together forever'. \"And we were.\" Ronnie died in 2020 at the age of 75 after suffering a stroke and the couple say they miss him terribly.\n\nRonnie left £40,000 to charity in his will, which was the exact amount needed to fix the roof of the Lockwood centre\n\nOnly 50 people were allowed to go to his funeral due to Covid but \"tickets were hotter than a Coldplay concert\" Rob joked. They received at least 100 sympathy cards, from \"Oxford University professors, to politicians and the unemployed\". After his death, a new £1.6m wellbeing centre attached to Glenwood Church in Cardiff was named Lockwood House, after Ronnie. But the old building and the new building didn't quite match, and they needed extra funding to finish the renovation. \"But they needn't have worried,\" said Rob. \"Almost to the penny, it was the exact amount Ronnie had left in his will. \"In the end the homeless man put the roof over all of our heads.\" \"Isn't that amazing, I just think it's all meant to be,\" said Dianne. \"People say to us, how did it happen - 45 years - but the honest truth is, in some ways, it happened a day at a time. \"Ronnie brought a richness into our lives.\"",

      "content": "In 2021, after the Taliban takeover, Nila Ibrahimi and her family fled Afghanistan. Having been a vocal rights advocate since the age of thirteen, when she led a viral campaign that successfully overturned a government ban preventing Afghan girls over the age of 12 from singing in public, she knew that she risked being a target of the new regime.\n\nUN Youth Office\n\nAfter spending time in hiding, she now lives in Canada, but she hasn’t left activism behind. From her new home, she started HerStory, an organisation dedicated to documenting the experiences of girls both inside Afghanistan and across the diaspora.\n\n“I do my best to tell the stories of girls who have been banned from going to school. I was able to graduate but my friends are still stuck in time in the ninth grade. It’s emotional work, but I think that if it motivates just one person to do something, then I think that I have done enough”.\n\nActive partners in peace\n\nMs. Ibrahimi was speaking to UN News at an event held on 15 December to mark the tenth anniversary of Security Council Resolution 2250, which formally recognises young people as active partners in maintaining and promoting international peace and security.\n\nAround half the people on the planet are under 30, which makes them the generation with the greatest stake in our common future. Nevertheless, they are often excluded from the spaces where solutions to our most intractable issues are shaped.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nSince the adoption of the resolution, the UN has supported a host of initiatives implementing the recommendations it contains. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Gambia, and Honduras developed Youth, Peace & Security (YPS) national and local action plans; the African Union held Africa’s first continent-wide dialogue on YPS, culminating in the Bujumbura Declaration; and 11 countries, from Africa to the Middle East, Asia and Europe, have so far enacted YPS action plans that are aligned with Resolution 2250.\n\nAfghanistan, still ruled by the Taliban, is not one of them. However, Ms. Ibrahimi, who has often felt that she is ploughing a lonely furrow, remains undaunted and dedicated to continuing the fight for women’s rights.\n\n“It really struck me, in the conference, that I'm in the same room as some people who I would never have had the opportunity to meet and learn about the ways that they have implemented strategies to empower youth in their countries,” she reflects. “Just being in their presence has been a big privilege and opportunity to not just talk about my own story and raise the voices of Afghan women but also learn from others”.\n\nAct now for peace\n\nThe 15 December events culminated in a Peace Circle, featuring Ms. Ibrahimi, several other young leaders, and senior UN officials, diplomats and academics. Peace Circles grew out of a major UN initiative, as part of the flagship Act Now campaign. They are informal dialogues on subjects connected to peace, which could range from subjects as wide-ranging as education gender equality, climate and technology. At least half of the participants have to be under 30, with an emphasis on young people who are often not at the table and new to UN spaces.\n\nThe Act Now for Peace campaign runs until September 2026, and the discussions held at the Peace Circles will directly feed into a number of UN projects, including the UN Secretary-General’s Independent Study on youth contributions to peace, and a Global Youth Peace Manifesto.\n\nFind detailed information on how to set up a Peace Circle here.",

      "personality_title": "UN marks 10 years of youth leading peace and security efforts",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** –\nThe United Nations (UN) passed a special rule called Security Council Resolution 2250 ten years ago. This rule says young people should be part of making decisions about peace and safety around the world. Before this, young people were often left out of these important talks.\n\n**What happened** –\nOn December 15, 2023, the UN held an event to celebrate ten years since this rule started. Young leaders, including Nila Ibrahimi, an Afghan activist now living in Canada, shared their experiences. Nila began fighting for girls’ rights in Afghanistan when she was just 13. After fleeing her country because of the Taliban takeover, she created an organization called HerStory to tell the stories of girls who can’t go to school. The UN also shared how many countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Honduras have made plans to include young people in peace work.\n\n**Impact** –\nThis rule is important because almost half the world’s people are under 30, yet they often don’t get to help solve big problems like war and violence. Thanks to this UN rule, many countries now listen to young people and include their ideas in peace plans. This helps create safer communities and gives young people a chance to lead. Even in places like Afghanistan, where challenges remain, young activists like Nila keep working to raise their voices.\n\n**What’s next step** –\nThe UN’s Act Now for Peace campaign will continue until 2026. It encourages more young people to join discussions called Peace Circles, where they talk about topics like education, equality, and technology. These talks will help shape future UN projects, including a global plan called the Youth Peace Manifesto. This means young people’s ideas will keep influencing peace efforts worldwide.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** –\nFor ten years, the UN’s rule has helped young people worldwide become active leaders in building peace and making communities safer.\n",

Avant cela, les jeunes étaient souvent exclus de ces discussions importantes.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** –\nLe 15 décembre 2023, l’ONU a organisé un événement pour célébrer les dix ans de cette résolution. Des jeunes leaders, dont Nila Ibrahimi, une militante afghane vivant aujourd’hui au Canada, ont partagé leurs expériences. Nila a commencé à défendre les droits des filles dès l’âge de 13 ans. Après avoir fui l’Afghanistan à cause de la prise de pouvoir des talibans, elle a créé HerStory, une organisation qui raconte les histoires des filles privées d’école. L’ONU a aussi présenté plusieurs pays, comme la République démocratique du Congo et le Honduras, qui ont mis en place des plans pour inclure les jeunes dans les actions pour la paix.\n\n**Impact** –\nCette règle est importante car presque la moitié de la population mondiale a moins de 30 ans, mais ces jeunes ne participaient pas assez aux solutions contre la guerre et la violence. Grâce à cette résolution, de nombreux pays écoutent désormais les jeunes et intègrent leurs idées dans les plans de paix. Cela aide à bâtir des communautés plus sûres et donne aux jeunes un rôle de leader. Même dans des pays comme l’Afghanistan, où la situation reste difficile, des jeunes comme Nila continuent de faire entendre leur voix.\n\n**Prochaine étape** –\nLa campagne Act Now for Peace de l’ONU se poursuivra jusqu’en 2026. Elle invite davantage de jeunes à participer à des discussions appelées Cercles de Paix, où ils parlent de sujets comme l’éducation, l’égalité et la technologie. Ces échanges aideront à construire des projets futurs de l’ONU, dont un plan mondial appelé le Manifeste pour la paix des jeunes. Cela signifie que les idées des jeunes continueront d’influencer les efforts pour la paix à travers le monde.\n\n**En une phrase** –\nDepuis dix ans, la règle de l’ONU permet aux jeunes du monde entier de devenir des leaders actifs pour construire la paix et rendre les communautés plus sûres.\n",

Esta regla dice que los jóvenes deben participar en las decisiones sobre la paz y la seguridad en el mundo. Antes, los jóvenes muchas veces no tenían voz en estas conversaciones importantes.\n\n**Qué pasó** –\nEl 15 de diciembre de 2023, la ONU organizó un evento para celebrar los diez años de esta resolución. Jóvenes líderes, como Nila Ibrahimi, una activista afgana que ahora vive en Canadá, compartieron sus historias. Nila comenzó a defender los derechos de las niñas cuando tenía solo 13 años. Tras huir de Afganistán por la llegada de los talibanes, creó HerStory, una organización que cuenta las historias de niñas que no pueden ir a la escuela. La ONU también mostró cómo varios países, como la República Democrática del Congo y Honduras, han creado planes para incluir a los jóvenes en el trabajo por la paz.\n\n**Impacto** –\nEsta regla es importante porque casi la mitad de las personas en el mundo tienen menos de 30 años, pero no siempre participan en la solución de problemas como la guerra y la violencia. Gracias a esta resolución, muchos países ahora escuchan a los jóvenes e incluyen sus ideas en los planes de paz. Esto ayuda a construir comunidades más seguras y da a los jóvenes la oportunidad de liderar. Incluso en lugares como Afganistán, donde las dificultades continúan, jóvenes como Nila siguen luchando para que se escuchen sus voces.\n\n**Próximo paso** –\nLa campaña Act Now for Peace de la ONU continuará hasta 2026. Invita a más jóvenes a unirse a discusiones llamadas Círculos de Paz, donde hablan sobre temas como educación, igualdad y tecnología. Estas conversaciones ayudarán a crear futuros proyectos de la ONU, incluyendo un plan global llamado el Manifiesto de Paz Juvenil. Esto significa que las ideas de los jóvenes seguirán influyendo en los esfuerzos de paz alrededor del mundo.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** –\nDurante diez años, la regla de la ONU ha ayudado a que los jóvenes de todo el mundo sean líderes activos para construir la paz y hacer que las comunidades sean más seguras.\n",

      "summary": " Although “significant restrictions and impediments” continue to hamper humanitarian operations in Gaza, teams are still responding to the population’s needs, the UN aid coordination office OCHA said on Wednesday. ",
      "content": "“As part of these efforts, the UN and its partners offload more essential supplies at crossings around Gaza every day,” it said.\n\nOn Monday, humanitarians offloaded nearly 4,000 pallets of aid at two border crossings – Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem in the southern Strip and Zikim in the north.\n\nFood, water and other supplies\n\nAround 65 per cent of the pallets contained food supplies, while 12 per cent carried shelter items. Another 12 per cent were water, sanitation and hygiene items, and 7 per cent comprised health and nutrition supplies.\n\nThe UN also attempted to coordinate five humanitarian movements with the Israeli authorities on Tuesday. While three were facilitated, one was initially approved but never received clearance to proceed, and another was cancelled by the organisers.\n\n“As a result, teams could redeploy staff and carry out some of the planned collection of food and health supplies from Kerem Shalom crossing, alongside other missions in areas where coordination with the Israeli authorities was not required,” OCHA said.\n\nWinter kits for children\n\nOn the education front, partners distributed more than 2,000 winterization kits to children aged 12 to 14 years, as well as deploying and distributing 58 specialized tents across 16 learning centres.\n\nThe move aims to expand classroom space and is expected to accommodate nearly 25,000 children.\n\nOther partners working in mine action continue inspecting key areas for potential explosive hazards. In this regard, two assessments were to support the removal of rubble in Deir al Balah and Gaza city were carried out on Monday.\n\n© Agricultural Development Association – PARC Olive harvest season in the occupied West Bank, Oct 2025.\n\nWest Bank: Farming families need support\n\nMeanwhile, more than 72,000 families in the West Bank who grow crops or raise animals require urgent emergency assistance, according to a survey by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n\nIt finds that around 90 per cent of agricultural families have recently lost income, mainly due to sharp declines in both crop and livestock production as well as sales.\n\nFAO stressed that supporting farmers and herders in the West Bank is critical to produce food, sustain livestock and avert a deeper crisis.\n\n“Agricultural families urgently need assistance – both cash and in-kind – to mitigate the impacts of widespread settler violence, a deepening economic crisis and near-ubiquitous loss of income,” said Rein Paulsen, Director of FAO’s Office of Emergencies and Resilience.\n\nConflict, rising costs and other challenges\n\nAgriculture remains a vital lifeline in the West Bank. Of the approximately 700,000 families there, around 115,000 depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, highlighting the sector’s importance to food security and income.\n\nThe Data in Emergencies (DIEM) survey also reveals the mounting pressures facing agricultural families. Nearly 9 in 10, or about 100,000 households, have recently experienced at least one acute “shock” such as conflict and violence, rising living costs, and job loss.\n\nOther challenges they face include limited access to water, movement restrictions and land access constraints, as well as high fuel and transport costs.\n\nThe survey was conducted between July and August, marking the second time it was carried out this year.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Gaza and the West Bank face ongoing difficulties from conflict, restrictions, and economic problems. Many families rely on farming or need basic supplies, but delivering help can be hard.\n\n**What happened** – The United Nations and its partners brought nearly 4,000 pallets of aid into Gaza, including food, water, shelter items, and health supplies. They also gave over 2,000 winter kits to children and set up tents to create more classroom space for nearly 25,000 students. In the West Bank, a UN survey found that over 72,000 farming families urgently need support because many have lost income due to lower crop and animal production.\n\n**Impact** – These efforts show that help is reaching people even when there are big obstacles. Providing food, clean water, and education materials helps improve daily life for tens of thousands. Supporting farmers in the West Bank is important because agriculture feeds families and keeps the economy going. Without aid, many could face deeper problems.\n\n**What's next step** – Humanitarian teams will keep working to deliver supplies and expand education in Gaza. The UN and partners plan to support West Bank farming families with cash and goods to protect their livelihoods. They will also continue checking for dangers like unexploded bombs to keep communities safe.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Despite many challenges, ongoing humanitarian aid is helping thousands of people in Gaza and the West Bank with food, education, and farming support.\n",
