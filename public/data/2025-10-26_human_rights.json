      "content": "Adopted by the General Assembly in December 2024 after five years of negotiation, the Convention against Cybercrime establishes the first universal framework for investigating and prosecuting offences committed online – from ransomware and financial fraud to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.\n\n“The UN Cybercrime Convention is a powerful, legally binding instrument to strengthen our collective defences against cybercrime,” said Mr. Guterres at the signing ceremony on Saturday.\n\n“It is a testament to the continued power of multilateralism to deliver solutions. And it is a vow that no country, no matter their level of development, will be left defenceless against cybercrime.”\n\nThe signing ceremony was hosted by Viet Nam in collaboration with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), drawing senior officials, diplomats and experts from across regions.\n\nA global framework for cooperation\n\nThe new treaty criminalises a range of cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled offences, facilitates the sharing of electronic evidence across borders and establishes a 24/7 cooperation network among States.\n\nIt also makes history as the first international treaty to recognise the non-consensual dissemination of intimate images as an offence – a significant victory for victims of online abuse.\n\nIt will enter into force 90 days after the 40th State deposits its ratification.\n\nRead more about the Convention here.\n\nUN in Viet Nam Secretary-General António Guterres addresses delegates at the signing ceremony.\n\nA collective defence for the digital age\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Guterres warned that while technology has brought “extraordinary progress,” it has also created new vulnerabilities.\n\n“Every day, sophisticated scams defraud families, steal livelihoods and drain billions of dollars from our economies,” he said. “In cyberspace, nobody is safe until everybody is safe. One vulnerability anywhere can expose people and institutions everywhere.”\n\nThe Secretary-General emphasised the Convention represents “a victory for victims of online abuse” and “a clear pathway for investigators and prosecutors” to overcome barriers to justice when crimes and evidence cross multiple borders.\n\nBy providing a global standard for electronic evidence, the treaty aims to improve cooperation between law enforcement agencies while safeguarding privacy, dignity and fundamental human rights.\n\nUN in Viet Nam Secretary-General António Guterres (left) and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh of Viet Nam at the joint press conference.\n\nUN chief’s visit to Viet Nam\n\nThe signing ceremony formed part of Mr. Guterres’ official visit to Viet Nam, where he also met with President Lương Cường, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and other top officials.\n\nAt a joint press conference with the Prime Minister, Mr. Guterres highlighted Viet Nam’s vital role in the global digital supply chain.\n\n“It is fitting that [the signing ceremony] takes place here – in a nation that has embraced technology, powered innovation and become an essential part of the world’s digital supply chains,” he said, urging States to swiftly ratify and implement the treaty.\n\n“Now we must turn signatures into action,” he said. “The Convention must be ratified quickly, implemented fully, and supported with funding, training and technology – especially for developing countries.”\n\nA safer cyberspace for all\n\nThe new convention is expected to reshape how countries tackle cybercrime at a time when digital threats are rising sharply. Global cybercrime costs are projected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, according to industry experts.\n\nFor many governments, particularly in the Global South, the treaty represents an opportunity to access training, technical assistance and real-time cooperation channels.\n\n“Let us seize this moment,” Mr. Guterres said. “Let us build a cyberspace that respects everyone’s dignity and human rights – and ensure that the digital age delivers peace, security and prosperity for all.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Cybercrime is a growing problem that affects people and countries everywhere. Until now, there was no global agreement to help nations work together to catch and punish criminals who use the internet for illegal activities like fraud or sharing private images without permission.\n\n**What happened** – On a recent Saturday in Hanoi, 65 countries signed a new United Nations treaty called the Convention against Cybercrime. This treaty was created after five years of talks and sets common rules for investigating online crimes. It also allows countries to share electronic evidence quickly and work together 24/7. For the first time, it makes spreading private images without consent a crime recognized by many nations.\n\n**Impact** – This treaty is important because it creates the first worldwide legal framework to fight cybercrime. It helps protect victims of online abuse and makes it easier for police and courts in different countries to cooperate. The treaty also promises support for developing countries through training and technology, so no country is left unprotected against cyber threats.\n\n**What's next step** – The treaty will officially start once 40 countries approve it fully. Leaders are now encouraging more countries to ratify and use the treaty quickly.

      "summary": "Peru's Mashco Piro face a struggle to survive in the 21st Century, but locals want to help them.",
      "content": "'Brothers in the forest' - the fight to protect an isolated Amazon tribe\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Stephanie Hegarty Global population correspondent Share Save\n\nFenamad\n\nTomas Anez Dos Santos was working in a small clearing in the Peruvian Amazon, when he heard footsteps approaching in the forest. He realised he was surrounded, and froze. \"One was standing, aiming with an arrow,\" he says. \"And somehow he noticed I was here and I started to run.\" He had come face to face with the Mashco Piro. For decades, Tomas - who lives in the small village of Nueva Oceania - had been practically a neighbour to these nomadic people, who shun contact with outsiders. However, until very recently, he had rarely seen them. The Mashco Piro have chosen to be cut off from the world for more than a century. They hunt with long bows and arrows, relying on the Amazonian rainforest for everything they need. \"They started circling and whistling, imitating animals, many different types of birds,\" Tomas recalls. \"I kept saying: 'Nomole' (brother). Then they gathered, they felt closer, so we headed toward the river and ran.\"\n\nTomas feels protective towards the Mashco Piro: \"Let them live as they live\"\n\nA new report by the human rights organisation, Survival International, says there are at least 196 of what it calls \"uncontacted groups\" left in the world. The Mashco Piro is believed to be the largest. The report says half of these groups could be wiped out in the next decade if governments don't do more to protect them. It claims the biggest risks are from logging, mining or drilling for oil. Uncontacted groups are extremely vulnerable to basic disease - as such, the report says a threat is posed by contact with evangelical missionaries and social media influencers looking for clicks. Recently, Mashco Piro people have been coming to Nueva Oceania more and more, according to locals. The village is a fishing community of seven or eight families, sitting high on the banks of the Tauhamanu River in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, 10 hours from the nearest settlement by boat. The area is not recognised as a protected reserve for uncontacted groups, and logging companies operate here. Tomas says that, at times, the noise of logging machinery can be heard day and night, and the Mashco Piro people are seeing their forest disturbed and destroyed. In Nueva Oceania, people say they are conflicted. They fear the Mashco Piro's arrows but they also have deep respect for their \"brothers\" who live in the forest and want to protect them. \"Let them live as they live, we can't change their culture. That's why we keep our distance,\" says Tomas.\n\nFenamad Mashco Piro people photographed in Peru's Madre de Dios province, June 2024\n\nThe people in Nueva Oceania are worried about the damage to the Mascho Piro's livelihood, the threat of violence and the possibility that loggers might expose the Mashco Piro to diseases they have no immunity to. While we were in the village, the Mashco Piro made their presence felt again. Letitia Rodriguez Lopez, a young mother with a two-year-old daughter, was in the forest picking fruit when she heard them. \"We heard shouting, cries from people, many of them. As if there were a whole group shouting,\" she told us. It was the first time she had encountered the Mashco Piro and she ran. An hour later, her head was still pounding from fear. \"Because there are loggers and companies cutting down the forest they're running away, maybe out of fear and they end up near us,\" she said. \"We don't know how they might react to us. That's what scares me.\" In 2022, two loggers were attacked by the Mashco Piro while fishing. One was hit by an arrow to the gut. He survived, but the other man was found dead days later with nine arrow wounds in his body.\n\nGoogle/BBC Nueva Oceania is a small fishing village in the Peruvian rainforest\n\nThe Peruvian government has a policy of non-contact with isolated people, making it illegal to initiate interactions with them. The policy originated in Brazil after decades of campaigning by indigenous rights groups, who saw that initial contact with isolated people lead to entire groups being wiped out by disease, poverty and malnutrition. In the 1980s, when the Nahau people in Peru made initial contact with the world outside, 50% of their population died within a matter of years. In the 1990s, the Muruhanua people faced the same fate. \"Isolated indigenous peoples are very vulnerable - epidemiologically, any contact could transmit diseases, and even the simplest ones could wipe them out,\" says Issrail Aquisse from the Peruvian indigenous rights group, Femanad. \"Culturally too, any contact or interference can be very harmful to their life and health as a society.\" For the neighbours of uncontacted tribes, the reality of no-contact can be tricky. As Tomas shows us around the forest clearing where he encountered the Mashco Piro, he stops, whistles through his hands and then waits in silence. \"If they answer, we turn back,\" he says. All we can hear is the chatter of insects and birds. \"They're not here.\" Tomas feels the government has left the residents of Nueva Oceania to handle a tense situation by themselves. He plants food in his garden for the Mashco Piro to take. It is a safety measure he and other villagers have come up with to help their neighbours and protect themselves. \"I wish I knew the words to say, 'Here have these plantains, it's a gift,'\" he adds. \"'You can take them freely. Don't shoot me.'\"\n\nAt the control post\n\nAlmost 200km south-east on the other side of the dense forest, the situation is very different. There, by the Manu River, the Mashco Piro live in an area that is officially recognised as a forest reserve. The Peruvian Ministry of Culture and Fenamad run the \"Nomole\" control post here, staffed by eight agents. It was set up in 2013 when conflict between Mashco Piro and local villages resulted in several killings. As the head of the control post, Antonio Trigoso Ydalgo's job is to stop that from happening again. The Mashco Piro appear regularly, sometimes several times a week. They are a different group of people from those near Nueva Oceania, and the agents don't believe they know each other.\n\nFenamad Mashco Piro people approach the Nomole control post\n\n\"They always come out at the same place. That's where they shout from,\" Antonio says, pointing across the wide Manu River to a small shingly beach on the other side. They ask for plantain, yucca or sugar cane. \"If we don't answer, they sit there all day waiting,\" Antonio says. The agents try to avoid that, in case tourists or local boats pass by. So they usually comply. The control post has a small garden they grow food in. When it runs out, they ask a local village for supplies. If these aren't available, the agents ask the Mashco Piro to come back in a few days' time. It has worked so far, and there has been little conflict recently. There are about 40 people who Antonio sees regularly - men, women and children from several different families. They name themselves after animals. The chief is called Kamotolo (Honey Bee). The agents say he is a stern man and never smiles. Another leader, Tkotko (Vulture) is more of a joker, he laughs a lot and makes fun of the agents. There is a young woman called Yomako (Dragon) who the agents say has a good sense of humour too. The Mashco Piro don't seem to have much interest in the outside world but are interested in the personal lives of the agents they meet. They ask about their families and where they live.\n\nA monkey-tooth necklace presented as a gift by the Mashco Piro to one of the agents at Nomole\n\nWhen one agent was pregnant and went on maternity leave, they brought a rattle made from the throat of a howler monkey for the baby to play with. They are interested in the agents' clothes, especially sports clothes in red or green. \"When we approach, we put on old, torn clothes with missing buttons - so they don't take them,\" Antonio says. \"Before, they wore their own traditional clothing - very beautiful skirts made with threads from insect fibres that they crafted themselves. But now some of them, when tourist boats pass, receive clothes or boots.\" says Eduardo Pancho Pisarlo, an agent at the control post.\n\nFenamad Little is still known about who the Mashco Piro people are\n\nBut any time the team ask about life in the forest, the Mashco Piro shut the conversation down. \"Once, I asked how they light their fires,\" says Antonio. \"They told me, 'You have wood, you know.' I insisted, and they said, 'You already have all these things - why do you want to know?'\" If someone doesn't appear for quite a while, the agents will ask where they are. If the Mashco Piro say, \"Don't ask\", they take it to mean that person has died. After years of contact, the agents still know little about how the Mashco Piro live or why they remain in the forest. It is believed they may be descended from indigenous people who fled into the deep jungle in the late 19th Century, escaping rampant exploitation and widespread massacres by so-called \"rubber barons\". Experts think the Mashco Piro may be closely related to the Yine, an indigenous people from south-eastern Peru. They speak an antiquated dialect of the same language, which the agents, who are also Yine, have been able to learn. But the Yine have long been river navigators, farmers and fishermen, while the Mashco Piro seem to have forgotten how to do these things. They may have become nomads and hunter-gatherers to stay safe. \"What I understand now is that they stay in one area for a while, set up a camp, and the whole family gather,\" says Antonio. \"Once they've hunted everything around that place, they move to another site.\"\n\nFenamad The Mashco Piro hunt in the Amazon rainforest using spears and arrows\n\nIssrail Aquisse from Fenamad says more than 100 people have come to the control post at various times. \"They ask for bananas and cassava to diversify their diet, but some families disappear for months or years after that,\" he says. \"They just say: 'I'm going away for a few moons, then I'll come back.' And they say goodbye.\" The Mashco Piro in this area are well protected but the government is building a road which will connect it to an area where illegal mining is widespread. But it is clear to the agents that the Mashco Piro do not want to join the outside world. \"From my experience here at the post, they don't want to become 'civilised',\" Antonio says.\n\nAntonio says he regularly sees about 40 people regularly at the \"Nomole\" control post",

      "title": "How civil society groups and activists are planning to reclaim civic space in Vietnam",
      "summary": "In the international community, Vietnam's authoritarian status is relatively unknown compared to other places such as China and North Korea.",
      "content": "The civic space restrictions in Vietnam have made it more difficult for human rights groups and activists to fulfill their work without being targeted by authorities. Despite the risks, several initiatives and campaigns aim to empower more people to exercise their rights and promote positive change in their communities. Among those actively advocating for reforms are members of the Vietnamese diaspora who are concerned about their homeland and are eager to study their heritage.\n\nVietnam Rise, whose three founders are diaspora members, has been publishing studies, promoting fellowship programs, and collaborating with Southeast Asian-based networks to highlight the deteriorating state of civic space in Vietnam and promote innovative approaches to supporting grassroots activists and assisting citizens in pushing back against draconian policies.\n\nGlobal Voices interviewed Vietnam Rise about its mission, the challenges it faces in its work, and the role of regional collaboration in reclaiming civic space.\n\nGlobal Voices (GV): What is the goal of Vietnam Rise? How do you plan to fulfill your mission?\n\nVietnam Rise (VR): Vietnam Rise's core goal is to empower grassroots activists and civil society in Vietnam. We aim to fulfill this mission primarily through our biannual intakes for the incubation and fellowship programs. The fellowship program selects Vietnamese activists and trains them in leadership. The incubation program provides seed grants and project management support for grassroots activist groups. Fellows and incubation groups work across a wide variety of domains such as labor rights, educational access, and LGBT issues. We organize in-person training and study tours for activists to meet and share best practices with like-minded movement actors in Southeast Asia. The goal of these programs is to kickstart self-sustaining and empowered communities within Vietnam.\n\nGV: What are the challenges you face in your work, and how are you overcoming them?\n\nVR: Challenges we face within Vietnam include the state media's spreading of misinformation about Vietnam Rise’s purpose and the risk of political punishment. Vietnam is a one-party state with a closing legal space for civil society, a move marked by charges of tax evasion, anti-state propaganda, and “abusing democratic freedoms” against activists. Organizations that are unlisted and encourage people to doubt authority are marked as reactionary or, in extreme cases, terrorist. Punishment for political deviance is severe, forcing many grassroots activists into discreet and underground channels or to be silent altogether.\n\nIn the international community, another challenge is the relative obscurity of Vietnam's authoritarian state compared to places such as China and North Korea. Undoubtedly one reason for outsiders’ ignorance about Vietnam's politically closed society is its image of successful economic growth and desirable tourism destination. The lack of reliable and accessible information about Vietnamese activism written in English also makes informing a non-Vietnamese-speaking public about Vietnam's civil society difficult.\n\nGV: How important is regional collaboration and solidarity in protecting and reclaiming civic space in Vietnam?\n\nVR: As financial resources become scarce, regional collaboration and solidarity among already marginalized Southeast Asian activists have become more crucial than ever. One way to reclaim civic space is to pool one another's skills, data, and in-depth regional knowledge to solve problems. To use an example from our organization, Vietnam Rise is part of the Terali project, a helpdesk service for East and Southeast Asian human rights defenders to tackle cybersecurity issues. Involved helpdesk providers include TibCert (Tibet), Vietnam Rise (Vietnam), and Security Matters (Thailand, Hong Kong, Cambodia, and Malaysia). Our services seek to serve our specific communities while producing a shared database of common data threats and issues that will enrich our understanding of digital rights threats in Southeast Asia.\n\nVietnam Rise has been participating in regional dialogues like the 2025 Digital Rights Asia-Pacific Assembly (DRAPAC) to promote its work and learn from the experience of fellow activists. Its program manager shared this takeaway from their DRAPAC participation.\n\nEven amidst geopolitical challenges, we cannot assume that resources are as scarce as we are making them seem. Clearly, there are many motivated young activists who continue to attend DRAPAC and share experiences with one another. With some strategic reallocation of resources and collaboration, we will be able to adapt to and thrive in hostile environments. This attitude of measured optimism and commitment to mutually beneficial connections will carry civil society organisations forward.\n\nVietnam Rise is organizing the Social Movement Festival in November, which is expected to gather and celebrate communities, groups, and activists leading Vietnamese movements and youth-driven initiatives.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Vietnam is a country where the government tightly controls what people can say and do, making it hard for human rights groups and activists to work freely. Unlike countries such as China and North Korea, Vietnam’s strict rules are less known internationally. \n\n**What happened** – A group called Vietnam Rise, started by Vietnamese people living abroad, is helping activists inside Vietnam. They run programs that train leaders, give small grants to activist groups, and connect activists with others in Southeast Asia. Vietnam Rise also fights misinformation spread by the government and works quietly because activists risk serious punishment. They join regional projects to share knowledge on digital security and plan events to bring activists together.\n\n**Impact** – Vietnam Rise’s work is important because it supports people who want to improve rights in a country where speaking out is risky. Their programs cover many issues like workers’ rights, education, and LGBT rights. By connecting activists across countries, they help build stronger, safer communities that can keep pushing for change even under pressure.\n\n**What's next step** – Vietnam Rise will hold a Social Movement Festival in November to celebrate and unite activists and youth groups in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. They will also host a meeting where young activists discuss ways to include marginalized communities more effectively. This event will help share ideas and strengthen regional cooperation.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Vietnam Rise provides training, support, and regional connections to help activists in Vietnam overcome government restrictions and promote positive change.\n",
