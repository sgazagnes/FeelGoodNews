      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nToday in our Best of 2025 series, we’re highlighting business stories that prove doing good and doing well are not mutually exclusive. From ethical entrepreneurship to bold climate pivots, these are the innovations and ideas reshaping the economy for a more sustainable and inclusive future.\n\nIn a nation known for its relentless work ethic, Tokyo is making waves by introducing a four-day workweek for government employees starting this April. It’s a move aimed at tackling Japan’s record-low fertility rates while promoting better work-life balance. “We will review work styles… with flexibility, ensuring no one has to give up their career due to life events such as childbirth or childcare,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike announced in a policy speech, signaling a transformative approach to one of Japan’s most pressing challenges.\n\nA crisis decades in the making\n\nJapan’s fertility rate hit an all-time low of 1.2 last year, far below the replacement rate of 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population. According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, only 727,277 births were recorded nationwide in 2023. With a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce, experts warn that time is running out to reverse these trends.\n\n“Now is the time for Tokyo to take the initiative to protect and enhance the lives, livelihoods, and economy of our people during these challenging times for the nation,” Koike stated, underscoring the urgency of bold, family-friendly policies.\n\nWhat the new workweek means for families\n\nThe new four-day workweek is expected to offer government employees an extra day off each week, creating more time for childcare, family bonding, and personal well-being. In tandem, another policy will allow parents with young children in grades one through three to clock out early by accepting a small pay cut.\n\nThese policies are a step toward addressing the pressures working parents face. By prioritizing flexibility, the Tokyo government hopes to create an environment where choosing between career and family becomes a thing of the past.\n\nThe roots of the problem\n\nThe declining birth rate is often attributed to Japan’s notorious work culture, characterized by long hours and unrelenting expectations. This has led to health hazards, with extreme cases resulting in “karoshi”—death by overwork. For women, the choice between career and motherhood is particularly stark, as societal norms and workplace demands exacerbate the challenge of raising children.\n\nStatistics from the World Bank reveal a significant gender gap in Japan’s labor force participation: 55 percent for women compared to 72 percent for men, a disparity higher than in most other high-income nations. “Japan’s overtime culture makes pregnancy and raising children especially daunting,” one sociologist explained, emphasizing the urgent need for systemic change.\n\nLessons from abroad\n\nWhile the four-day workweek might seem revolutionary in Japan, the concept has gained traction globally. Companies in the West have started experimenting with compressed work schedules, reporting improvements in both productivity and employee well-being. Even within Asia, other nations are adopting family-friendly policies. Earlier this year, Singapore introduced guidelines requiring firms to accommodate flexible work arrangements, including shorter workweeks.\n\nHowever, for Japanese companies, the shift is particularly challenging. Culturally, time spent at work is often equated with loyalty, which presents a significant barrier to widespread adoption of progressive work policies.\n\nCan Tokyo lead the way?\n\nTokyo’s initiative has the potential to set a precedent for other regions and industries in Japan. By offering employees more time to focus on their families, the policy aims to address the root causes of the nation’s demographic decline. But whether the private sector will follow suit remains uncertain.\n\nAs the world watches, Tokyo’s bold experiment may become a blueprint for balancing economic growth with personal well-being.\n\nDid this solution from 2025 stand out to you?

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Japan faces a serious problem: its birth rate is very low, with fewer babies born each year than needed to keep the population steady. This is partly because many people work very long hours, making it hard to balance jobs and family life.\n\n**What happened** – Starting in April 2025, Tokyo’s government employees will work only four days a week instead of five. The city also lets parents with young children leave work early, even if it means a small pay cut. These changes aim to give workers more time for their families and reduce stress.\n\n**Impact** – This is an important step because Japan’s fertility rate—the number of children a woman has in her lifetime—is very low, at 1.2, while it needs to be 2.1 to keep the population stable. By giving parents more time and flexibility, Tokyo hopes to make it easier to have and raise children, which could help slow down the population decline. It also challenges Japan’s culture of long work hours and could improve gender equality at work.\n\n**What's next step** – Tokyo’s plan might encourage other cities and companies in Japan to offer shorter workweeks and family-friendly policies. Experts and leaders will watch closely to see if these changes help increase birth rates and improve workers’ lives.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Tokyo’s new four-day workweek aims to help families by giving workers more time at home, tackling Japan’s low birth rate and changing work habits for the better.",

Les experts et dirigeants surveilleront de près si ces changements aident à augmenter la natalité et à améliorer la vie des travailleurs.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – La nouvelle semaine de travail de quatre jours à Tokyo vise à aider les familles en donnant plus de temps aux travailleurs à la maison, pour lutter contre la faible natalité du Japon et changer les habitudes de travail.",

The 40 years that have passed have meant a great change for Spain, but Spain has also contributed during this time to the European project.\n\nBelow we review in ten facts what these four decades since accession to the EU have brought:\n\nFive presidencies of the Council of the EU\n\nSpain has held the presidency of the Council of the EU on five occasions. The Council is occupied on a rotating basis every six months by the different member states. The first time this occurred was in the first half of 1989 and the most recent in the second half of 2023. In between, Spain held the rotating presidency in the second half of 1995, in the first quarter of 2002 and in the first half of 2010.\n\nNine commissioners\n\nSince joining the EU, Spain has contributed a total of nine names to the different Commissions that have followed one another since then. Initially, when there were fewer member states than the current 27, each country contributed two names, but since 2004, when the “big enlargement” took place, the figure was reduced to one.\n\nThe first to hold the post were Abel Matutes and Manuel Marín, who joined the Jacques Delors Commission in 1986 and remained in their positions until 1994, in the case of the latter even becoming its vice-president.\n\nMarín continued as commissioner with the arrival of Jacques Santer to the presidency of the Commission in 1995 and became its president on an interim basis when he resigned in 1999, until Romano Prodi took over. In addition, during this period Marcelino Oreja also served as commissioner.\n\nIn the Prodi Commission (1999–2004) Spain’s representatives were Loyola de Palacio and Pedro Solbes, although the latter left the post in April 2004, which led to the arrival of Joaquín Almunia, who continued during the two terms of José Manuel Durao Barroso as president until 2014, holding the vice-presidency in the second of them and being in charge of Competition.\n\nNext, Miguel Arias Cañete arrived in Brussels to join the Jean Claude Juncker Commission until 2019, when, with Ursula Von der Leyen at the helm, Josep Borrell took over, being appointed vice-president and High Representative for foreign policy. At present, Teresa Ribera is the Spanish representative, holding the vice-presidency and the Clean Transition portfolio.\n\n60 MEPs\n\nThe number of Spanish representatives in the European Parliament has evolved over the years, at the same time as the number of seats has changed with the various enlargements. Thus, when Spain joined the EU it was allocated 61 MEPs, which rose to 64 in the 1999–2004 term.\n\nWith the 2004 enlargement, they were reduced to 54, a figure that remained unchanged until 2019, when they increased to 59 due to the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. In the current term, Spain has 61 MEPs by virtue of the new distribution as a result of Brexit.\n\nThree presidents of the European Parliament\n\nIn these 40 years, three Spaniards have held the Presidency of the European Parliament. The first to do so was the Socialist Enrique Barón Crespo between 1989 and 1992. After him, it was the turn of the People’s Party member José María Gil-Robles, between 1997 and 1999, while the last was the Socialist Josep Borrell, between 2004 and 2007.\n\nMore than 150 billion euros in cohesion funds\n\nIn these 40 years, Spain has received more than 150 billion euros in cohesion funds, that is, the aid provided by the EU to reduce the economic and territorial disparities of the member states.\n\nThis has translated, among other things, into the construction of public infrastructure — such as the 6.7 billion received since 2007 for high-speed rail infrastructure — the more than 7 million households that have gained access to broadband, or the nearly 150,000 companies that have benefited from these funds.\n\nMore than 350 billion from the European Social Fund\n\nThis fund is the main instrument with which the EU supports job creation, helps people obtain better jobs and guarantees fairer employment opportunities for all EU citizens. The funds received by Spain have reached more than 32 million people in this period, according to data from the State Public Employment Service.\n\nGDP has doubled\n\nThe steady economic progress that Spain’s entry into the EU has brought, with access to the single market and, since 2002, to the euro, has allowed GDP to more than double in these 40 years.\n\nEmployment has also doubled\n\nAccession brought with it new employment opportunities, which has meant that total employment has gone from 10.8 million jobs in 1986 to 21.1 million in 2024.\n\nIncrease in exports\n\nThe trade and preferential access agreements that the EU maintains with almost 80 countries — to which Mercosur could soon be added — have made it possible to increase Spain’s exports of goods. Thus, they have gone from 12.6 billion euros in 1986 (4.9% of GDP) to 141.5 billion euros in 2024 (8.9% of GDP).\n\nMore than 200,000 Erasmus students\n\nMore than 200,000 Spanish students have had the opportunity to pursue their studies in other EU member states thanks to the Erasmus program, created in 1987 and promoted by then commissioner Manuel Marín.\n\n((All these data are part of the initiative ‘Since 1986. 40 years building Europe together’, a compilation prepared by the Representation of the European Commission in Spain and the Office of the European Parliament in Spain)) (December 30)",

      "content": "More than 13.3 million entries and exits, thousands of refusals and uncovered fraud cases: The EU Commission sees the new entry system on track. It is not yet being used everywhere.\n\nBrussels (dpa) – Around two and a half months after the introduction of a new entry system for non-EU citizens, the EU Commission has drawn a positive conclusion. So far, around 100 cases of identity fraud have been uncovered with the help of the Entry-Exit System (EES), according to the Brussels authority.\n\nAccordingly, more than 13.3 million entries and exits have been recorded in the system, 60 percent of them using biometric data. By mid-December, nearly 7,000 refusals of entry had been recorded.\n\nNew system since mid-October\n\nEU Migration Commissioner Magnus Brunner said the system brings modern technology to the EU’s external borders, prevents entry with forged documents or false identities, and supports border authorities in their work. “This way we know who is coming from third countries, when these people enter Europe and when they leave the EU again,” Brunner said. In addition to the usual information from the passport, entrants must also provide and have stored biometric data – that is, fingerprints and facial images – according to the EU.\n\nSince October 12, the new procedure has been gradually introduced at EU border crossings. Non-EU citizens can register electronically at special counters. There are exceptions, for example, for people who have a residence card and are in a direct relationship with an EU citizen. Nothing changes for German nationals or nationals of other EU countries.\n\nFrom April 10, 2026, the system is to be operational at all crossing points of the European external borders. Then the stamp in the passport is also to become a thing of the past. The EU Commission said it is clearly on schedule. In Germany, the EES is already being used at airports in Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, Düsseldorf and Munich. (December 27)",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union has started using a new system to track people who enter and leave from countries outside the EU. This system records biometric data like fingerprints and facial images to make border checks safer and more accurate.\n\n**What happened** – Since the system began in mid-October 2023, it has recorded over 13.3 million entries and exits. It helped uncover about 100 cases of identity fraud and led to nearly 7,000 refusals of entry by mid-December. The system is currently in use at several major airports in Germany and will expand to all EU external borders by April 2026.\n\n**Impact** – This system helps border officers know exactly who is entering and leaving the EU, making it harder for people to use fake documents or false identities. By using biometric data, the EU improves security and migration control while speeding up the process for travelers.\n\n**What's next step** – The EU plans to have the system working at every external border crossing by April 10, 2026. At that point, the traditional passport stamp will no longer be needed, as the system will electronically record entries and exits.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU’s new biometric Entry-Exit System is successfully improving border security and will soon be used at all external borders to better track non-EU travelers.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’Union européenne a lancé un nouveau système pour suivre les personnes venant de pays hors UE qui entrent et sortent. Ce système enregistre des données biométriques comme les empreintes digitales et les images du visage pour rendre les contrôles aux frontières plus sûrs et plus précis.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Depuis son lancement à la mi-octobre 2023, plus de 13,3 millions d’entrées et sorties ont été enregistrées. Le système a aidé à découvrir environ 100 cas de fraude d’identité et a conduit à près de 7 000 refus d’entrée jusqu’à la mi-décembre. Il est déjà utilisé dans plusieurs grands aéroports en Allemagne et sera étendu à toutes les frontières extérieures de l’UE d’ici avril 2026.\n\n**Impact** – Ce système permet aux agents frontaliers de savoir exactement qui entre et sort de l’UE, rendant plus difficile l’utilisation de faux documents ou fausses identités. En utilisant des données biométriques, l’UE améliore la sécurité et le contrôle migratoire tout en accélérant le passage des voyageurs.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L’UE prévoit que le système fonctionne à tous les points de passage des frontières extérieures d’ici le 10 avril 2026. À ce moment-là, le tampon traditionnel dans le passeport ne sera plus nécessaire, car les entrées et sorties seront enregistrées électroniquement.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – Le nouveau système biométrique d’entrée et de sortie de l’UE améliore avec succès la sécurité aux frontières et sera bientôt utilisé sur toutes les frontières extérieures pour mieux suivre les voyageurs hors UE.",
