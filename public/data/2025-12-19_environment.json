      "title": "Sir David Attenborough's London - why he wouldn't live anywhere else",
      "summary": "In a new one-off documentary, the broadcaster and conservationist comes home - to London.",
      "content": "Sir David Attenborough's London - why he wouldn't live anywhere else\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Wendy Hurrell London Share Save\n\nBBC/Passion Planet Sir David Attenborough says London is a \"city full of hidden natural wonders\"\n\nLying on his side on a dark summer night earlier this year, Sir David Attenborough is watching a hedgehog snuffling around an urban garden. \"I think they're lovely things,\" he says softly, with a chuckle. His voice blends boyish wonder with the wisdom of his 99 years - each in equal measure. Considered by many as the most famous broadcaster and conservationist of our time, Sir David has circled the globe for 70 years to show us the brilliance of the natural world. Now, in a new one-off documentary, he has come home - to London.\n\nSir David has lived in Richmond, south-west London, for seven decades. The borough's royal park, he tells us, has been a \"refuge\" and \"source of inspiration\". It is in Richmond he starts and ends his documentary Wild London.\n\nGaby Bastyra, executive producer at Passion Planet, which made the film, said Sir David \"could live anywhere in the world… but he's always come home to London\". The programme, she says, is an \"appreciation of his place - and he loves it\". So can the capital's wildlife compare to the broadcaster's encounters with mountain gorillas in Rwanda, the mimicry of a lyrebird in Australia or a blue whale breaching beside his small boat?\n\nBBC/Passion Planet Sir David says that when he used to get the Tube to work, \"there was one animal that always brightened up my day\"\n\nWell, Wild London is abundant with animal curiosities: from pigeons hopping on to the Hammersmith and City line to a snake colony by a canal. Sir David also draws our awareness to the dramas happening every day among and above us in this city of about nine million people. In one scene, there are glimpses of a bullish, noisy beast through the summer leaves. This is not a preying tiger in the Indian jungle - but a happily mooching Dalmatian dog in Dagnam Park, Romford, unknowingly closing in on a days-old fallow deer fawn. David Mooney, chief executive of the London Wildlife Trust, which co-produced Wild London, said he was completely \"enthralled\" by that \"juxtaposition\". \"That's not to say that dogs are a problem. It's just wildlife is interacting with us at all times,\" he said. \"The raw experiences of nature are something that at London Wildlife Trust we've been talking about for a long time.\"\n\nBBC/Passion Planet Fallow deer are known to roam from Dagnam Park on to streets and front gardens in Harold Hill, Romford\n\nPerhaps the most poignant moments in Wild London, broadcast months before Sir David turns 100 years old, are where he shows particular tenderness towards the animals he meets. At the Houses of Parliament, he holds a peregrine falcon chick while it is ringed for identification. It tips its head back to look up at him as he says to it softly: \"Now we can recognise you anywhere - yes, yes you.\" In Greenford, west London, Sir David gently cradles a tiny harvest mouse before releasing it into a meadow. He encourages it to scramble on to a wildflower, with an affectionate: \"Welcome to your new home - there you go.\" It doesn't want to leave the safety of his cupped hands. Joe Loncraine, director of Wild London, has worked with Sir David on several other nature documentaries. He said: \"There were some moments I think that deliver the kind of interactions with him and an animal that I hadn't seen in a while. \"There was something about the warmth that came across. And I think his enthusiasm for what was happening was so infectious.\"\n\nBBC/Passion Planet Sir David delights at the offspring of a peregrine falcon pair that has nested on the Houses of Parliament for a decade\n\nSir David was greatly impressed by The Ealing Beaver Project, which he says in the film, has had such a \"positive impact\" in west London. He observes: \"If someone had told me when I first moved here that one day I would be watching wild beavers in London, I would have thought they were mad. But there they are, right behind me.\" He uses this as an example of us \"securing a brighter future for both animals, and us, too\" in our unique metropolis - the world's greenest major city. Mr Mooney said: \"His message is: people have to take note of it - if people notice it, they will begin to love it - if people love it, they'll want to protect it. And if people protect it, we'll be on a path to nature recovery.\" Wild London, coming late in such a revered canon of nature documentaries, is Sir David's way of nudging us to marvel at the nature on our doorsteps, amidst the frenzy of daily life. Mr Loncraine sums up: \"We can be rushing about our jobs, commuting to work, picking the kids up from school, going to the shops - and not really notice. \"There can be really quite beautiful animals right there - so it's just about taking that moment to have a look.\"",

      "title": "Guest Idea: Inspiring Kids to Care About Bees",
      "summary": "If we expect bees to survive the next century, education must start early. Kids are...\nThe post Guest Idea: Inspiring Kids to Care About Bees appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "If we expect bees to survive the next century, education must start early. Kids are already learning about recycling, oceans, and rainforests. So why aren’t bees on that list? Bees are not just honey producers. Their role in ecosystems is indispensable. So, it’s time we start caring for them too. After all, they pollinate about one-third of our food crops. Remove them, and our diets, farms, and wild landscapes collapse.\n\nWith two growing kids in the household and as a beekeeper, I have seen curiosity transform fear into fascination. When kids start to understand bees, they stop seeing danger and get curious, and that is what I like. A classroom can ignite that shift with hands-on learning and direct observation.\n\nHere’s how you can build that awareness in your kids in ways that stick.\n\nMake them curious, not scared\n\nFirst step is going to be removing the fear. Many kids grow up hearing that bees sting, swarm, and chase you down till you are tired. The first lesson you need to instill is frankly quite simple: bees don’t attack without a reason. Only female worker bees sting, and doing so costs them their life. This fact alone will tell students a lot about them and teach them that bees defend their home, not themselves.\n\nIn the classroom, start by comparing bee behavior to human work. A hive has clear rules set for every member. Every bee has a task to do. When kids see bees as workers, not threats, the fear slowly dissolves.\n\nDemonstrations help too. Move slowly when showing bee videos, explain how careful you need to be when handling hives, and explain how and when a defensive action is triggered. Teach kids to respect and understand their responses, and in turn, protect the bees.\n\nUse the senses: See and taste\n\nBees connect directly to human senses, and that makes them perfect for multisensory learning. A honey tasting session of different types of local honey can be super insightful for them. Explain why the differences exist. Nectar from each flower gives each type of honey its very unique chemistry. Light honey tends to come from early-blooming flowers with delicate sugars.\n\nDarker honey, from plants like buckwheat, holds more minerals and complex compounds.\n\nStudents quickly realize that honey is not just a product but an index of local biodiversity.\n\nLeverage active, ongoing learning\n\nLike bees, bee conservation education should also revolve around the routine rhythms of bee life. Instead of a one-day presentation, build a short recurring segment into the term. You can call it the “Bee Time.” Spend ten minutes a week revisiting all the facts, observing weather patterns that affect bee activity, or updating a “pollinator calendar.”\n\nTrivia works well for review. How many eyes does a bee have? (Five.) How many times does it flap its wings each second? (About 230.) What fraction of a teaspoon of honey does one worker make in her life? (Roughly 1/12.) Numbers like these easily hook into memory.\n\nYou can expand the concept into a small research project for the little ones. Ask them to track which flowers bloom around school across months, sketch them, and note which insects visit. This trains children to observe ecological changes.\n\nBring experts and let them become one\n\nNothing beats seeing real tools and stories from the field. Most regions have a beekeeping club or a local extension office with volunteers who enjoy outreach. Ask one to visit the class with spare equipment like smokers, hive frames, etc.\n\nLet the kids handle the gear. A frame filled with capped honey can weigh several kilograms, surprising even adults. Physical experience grounds the conservation in reality. Live bees are not always possible, so use magnified photos of bee anatomy to help students with the technical details.\n\nIf local expertise is scarce, online ones work too. Universities will often host entomology programs along with virtual sessions for kids. What matters is giving kids direct access to people who work with bees daily. When they hear passion in someone’s voice, information sticks.\n\nConnect lessons to real conservation\n\nInformation means nothing without action. Encourage students to make choices that help pollinators beyond the classroom. They need to learn that even the smallest changes add up.\n\nFor older students, citizen-science projects are a great option. Platforms like Bee Spotter or Bumble Bee Watch allow anyone to upload photos and location data. Scientists can use these submissions to track population shifts and identify threatened species. When a child sees their photo logged in a research map, conservation becomes personal.\n\nEven classroom art can double as awareness work. You just need to know where to look.\n\nTeach them to celebrate the bees\n\nTeaching kids about saving the bees isn’t a hobby project. Think of it as more of an ecological insurance. Every informed student transforms into a possible advocate for pollinators and biodiversity. When they understand that the success of a bee colony relies on precision, cooperation, and respect for natural systems, they learn principles that apply at scales much larger than a bee colony.\n\nIf we can help a single generation see bees as a partnering member of our ecosystem, we will ensure the hive and ecosystem are humming along as well.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nThis sponsored article was written by George Brooks, an enthusiastic hobbyist beekeeper for some years now. I love spending hours delving into the world of our fuzzy bee friends. Even today, I still get excited when I come across something new which I can share with you, our bee-loving readers.",

      "content": "Every year, Americans discard hundreds of millions of plastic shampoo and conditioner bottles. While many are technically recyclable, the reality is that most end up in landfills or, worse, our oceans. Making your own hair care products is one way to reduce this waste stream while taking control of what goes on your body—and down the drain.\n\nDIY hair care has exploded in popularity over the past decade, from the “no-poo” movement to ancient remedies making a modern comeback. But not all homemade recipes are created equal. Understanding the science behind hair care—particularly pH balance—can help you choose methods that are both eco-friendly and genuinely good for your hair.\n\nWhy Make Your Own Hair Care Products?\n\nIn addition to the fun and rewarding feeling of making something yourself, the benefits include fewer plastic bottles, potential cost savings, and fewer industrial chemicals in your life. Commercial shampoos often contain synthetic surfactants like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which helps create that satisfying lather. While SLS has developed a controversial reputation online, research published in Environmental Health Insights shows that it’s generally safe for human use when used in properly formulated products.\n\nThat said, concerns about SLS’s environmental impacts aren’t entirely unfounded. A 2023 Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety study found evidence that SLS is toxic to aquatic life at various concentrations, despite its biodegradability. The environmental impact depends largely on local wastewater treatment infrastructure and the ecosystem’s sensitivity.\n\nFor those seeking alternatives—whether for environmental reasons, sensitive skin, or simply curiosity—here are four DIY options, ranging from clarifying treatments to deep-conditioning masks.\n\nClassic Baking Soda Clarifying Wash\n\nIMPORTANT UPDATE: This recipe, first published in 2015, suggests using baking soda, but many dermatologists and trichologists advise against using baking soda as a regular shampoo replacement. Baking soda has a pH of approximately 9, while healthy hair and scalp are in the 4.5-5.5 pH range. Research suggests that products with a pH above 5.5 can damage the hair cuticle, leading to dryness, breakage, and increased porosity over time. If you don’t use the apple cider conditioner each time you wash, consider this an occasional clarifying treatment rather than a daily shampoo.\n\nBaking Soda Clarifying Wash with ACV Rinse\n\nThis classic “no-poo” recipe can help remove heavy product buildup when used occasionally. The apple cider vinegar rinse helps restore hair’s natural acidity after the alkaline wash.\n\nIngredients the Clarifying Wash:\n\n1 tablespoon baking soda\n\n250 ml (about 8.5 oz) warm water\n\nConditioning Rinse ingredients:\n\n1-2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or lemon juice\n\n250 ml warm water\n\nSteps:\n\nDissolve baking soda in warm water and pour over wet hair. Massage into scalp, focusing on the crown and hairline, then rinse thoroughly. Mix the vinegar or lemon juice with warm water. Pour through rinsed hair, let sit for 1-2 minutes, then rinse well with cool water.\n\nTip: If you have hard or heavily chlorinated water, consider boiling and cooling the water before mixing. We suggest limiting use to once monthly as a clarifying treatment and discontinuing use if you notice dryness, breakage, or scalp irritation.\n\npH-Balanced Coconut Milk & Aloe Cleansing Shampoo\n\nLooking for a gentler everyday alternative? This recipe from Deborah Harju at Hair Glow uses ingredients with naturally balanced pH levels that work with your hair’s chemistry rather than against it. Coconut milk (pH 6.0-7.0), aloe vera (pH 4.5), and raw honey (pH 4-5) combine to create a nourishing cleanser that won’t strip your hair’s protective oils.\n\nCoconut Milk & Aloe Gentle Shampoo\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup full-fat coconut milk\n\n½ cup pure aloe vera gel\n\n1 tablespoon raw honey\n\n5-10 drops essential oil (optionally, lavender or rosemary works well)\n\nSteps:\n\nBlend all ingredients until smooth and well-combined. Transfer to a squeeze bottle and refrigerate. Apply to wet hair, massage into scalp, and rinse thoroughly. Use within one week (no preservatives means limited shelf life).\n\nNote: This shampoo won’t lather like commercial products—that’s normal. The cleansing action comes from the coconut milk’s natural surfactants. Your hair may need 2-3 weeks to adjust if you’re transitioning from conventional shampoo.

While scientific research is still limited, the Cleveland Clinic notes that rice water contains inositol, a carbohydrate that may help strengthen hair and reduce friction.\n\nThe rice fermentation process lowers the pH and may enhance the nutrient content, making it gentler and potentially more beneficial than plain rice water.\n\nFermented Rice Water Strengthening Rinse\n\nIngredients:\n\n½ cup uncooked rice (white, brown, or jasmine)\n\n2 cups filtered water\n\nSteps:\n\nRinse rice thoroughly to remove impurities. Place rice in a bowl with 2 cups of water and let it soak for 30 minutes, swirling occasionally. Strain the cloudy water into a clean glass jar with a lid. Leave at room temperature for 24-48 hours to ferment (you’ll notice a slightly sour smell—that’s normal). Refrigerate until ready to use (keeps up to one week). After shampooing, pour rice water over hair, massage into scalp, and leave for 5-20 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with cool water.\n\nTip: Don’t ferment longer than 48 hours, or the rice water may become too acidic. Use once weekly. The leftover rice is perfectly fine to cook and eat! For more details, see Medical News Today’s guide to rice water for hair.\n\nZero-waste bonus: Making rice water means you’re using a byproduct of cooking dinner. Soak your rice in the afternoon, strain it for your hair rinse, then cook it for your evening meal. Two birds, one stone, zero waste.\n\nHoney & Aloe Vera Deep Conditioning Mask\n\nWhen your hair needs serious hydration, this nourishing mask shared by Healthline delivers. For centuries, aloe vera has been used for its moisturizing and soothing properties, while raw honey acts as a humectant that draws moisture into the hair shaft and locks it in. Adding coconut oil provides additional slip and shine.\n\nHoney & Aloe Deep Conditioning Mask\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 tablespoons pure aloe vera gel (from plant or store-bought)\n\n1 tablespoon raw honey\n\n1 tablespoon coconut oil (melted)\n\nSteps:\n\nMix all ingredients until smooth and well-blended. Apply to damp, freshly washed hair, focusing on mid-lengths and ends. Cover with a shower cap to trap heat and enhance absorption. Leave for 20-30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with cool water, then style as usual.\n\nPlease note that raw honey can gradually lighten hair with repeated use, so those wanting to maintain dark color should use this mask sparingly—perhaps once or twice monthly. This mask is especially beneficial for dry, damaged, or color-treated hair.

Here’s what to expect:\n\nAllow an adjustment period. Your scalp is accustomed to commercial products and may initially overproduce oil. Give it 2-4 weeks to adjust.\n\nPatch test first. Apply any new recipe to a small section of hair before applying it to the entire head, especially if you have sensitive skin or allergies.\n\nWatch for warning signs. If you experience persistent dryness, breakage, itching, or irritation, discontinue use and reassess your approach.\n\nConsider your water. Hard water can interfere with DIY products. A shower filter or using distilled water in your recipes may help.\n\nStore properly. Without preservatives, homemade products have short shelf lives. Refrigerate and use within the timeframes specified.\n\nDIY hair care can be a rewarding way to reduce plastic waste and simplify your routine, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. What works beautifully for one person may not suit another’s hair type, water quality, or lifestyle. Start with gentler, pH-balanced options like the coconut milk shampoo or rice water rinse, and save the baking soda treatment for occasional deep clarifying when you have significant product buildup.\n\nThe most sustainable choice is the one you’ll actually stick with. If DIY doesn’t work for your hair, look for concentrated shampoo bars, refillable options, or brands using post-consumer recycled packaging. Every step toward reducing single-use plastic makes a difference.\n\nEditor’s Note: This article was originally published on November 6, 2015, and was substantially updated with additional information and recipes in December 2025.",
