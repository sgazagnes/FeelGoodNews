      "title": "From Cape Town to London, Deo Kato runs to challenge racism and reclaim the migration narrative",
      "summary": "Step by step, mile by mile, Deo Kato ran his way across a continent — and beyond. After a year and a half on the road, the Ugandan British runner and campaigner has become the first person to run from Cape Town to London.",
      "content": "The 8,262-mile journey took him through 21 countries, transforming an extraordinary physical feat into a powerful act of activism, aimed at confronting racism and reshaping how migration is understood.\n\nBorn in Uganda and raised in the United Kingdom, Deo first took up running to manage his health. Over time, that personal discipline grew into a journey of purpose, connecting endurance with identity, protest and hope.\n\nTurning point\n\nIn 2020, a moment of global reckoning around racial injustice – the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis – became a turning point for Deo. He realised his running could serve a purpose beyond endurance.\n\n“I thought, ‘I have to do something about this. Whether it’s small or big, I want to use my running to create change and speak out against racial injustice,’” he explained.\n\nThat conviction led him to run ten kilometres every day for 381 days, marking each day of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a pivotal moment in the United States civil rights movement.\n\nHe told himself, “I’m going to keep doing this for as long as I can because this is how change happens.”\n\n© IOM/Joe Newman Day after day, Deo pushed forward, turning physical endurance into a form of activism aimed at confronting racism and amplifying conversations around migration and justice.\n\nRetracing migration routes\n\nFrom this commitment, Deo set out to run from Cape Town to London, symbolically retracing humanity’s earliest migration routes from Africa.\n\nThe road ahead was long and arduous. Scaling mountains, crossing deserts, and running through wildlife reserves, Deo moved through landscapes that constantly shifted around him.\n\n“It feels incredible just to be moving. Then, suddenly, I see elephants and children start running beside me,” he shared.\n\nBarriers and restrictions\n\nAlong the way, Deo witnessed how complex and restrictive migration can be, particularly for people displaced by climate impacts, economic pressure, or conflict.\n\nHe saw how limited regular pathways and movement restrictions leave many people effectively unable to move within their own regions, trapping them in unsafe or uncertain situations and cutting off routes to safety.\n\n“Some people end up detained simply for trying to flee conflict or because they are seen as outsiders. Even when they have the correct paperwork, they can still be held.”\n\nThe further I travelled along the migration route, the more I was viewed as an irregular migrant.\n\nDeo himself faced similar barriers. At one point, he was detained despite having the correct documents. In other areas, he was forced to reroute his journey because of conflict or restricted access.\n\nAs he travelled north towards Europe, the scrutiny intensified.\n\n“The further I travelled along the migration route, the more I was viewed as an irregular migrant. People would call the police simply because they saw someone they thought didn’t belong passing through their area,” he explained.\n\n© Courtesy of Deo Kato Crossing some of the world’s most spectacular and unforgiving terrain, Deo experienced Africa on foot, where nature and movement shaped every mile of his journey.\n\nCommunity support\n\nDespite the challenges, Deo’s journey was sustained by community support. Along the way, local runners, strangers, and online supporters joined him. Those moments of shared effort and solidarity kept him going.\n\n“Without that community support, I would not have succeeded on this journey. It’s what truly gave it meaning,” he said.\n\nHis journey was never about endurance alone. It was about reclaiming the story of migration – a story rooted in resilience, human progress, and development.\n\n“People move for so many reasons, and each journey tells a human story,” Deo emphasised.\n\nLooking ahead, he plans to keep using his platform as a form of activism, continuing to speak about migration, belonging, and shared humanity. As he puts it, “Don’t limit yourself. Believe in your power to create change.”",

      "summary": "“Women often carry heavier emotional burdens. Without mental resilience, it is easy to break so I protect myself carefully.”",
      "content": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nKant Kaw’s journey into journalism officially began in 2009, but her story started long before that. As a child, she devoured books of every kind, captivated by the power of language. She dreamed of becoming a writer, yet understood early that writing alone could not sustain her. So she pursued practical jobs while holding on to her passion.\n\nEverything changed the day she discovered journalism. For her, it was the perfect convergence of purpose and livelihood. It allowed her to write, to witness, and to serve the public. Fifteen years later, she remains in the field, saying that she never stopped loving the work.\n\n“I absolutely love thinking up and writing news and article ideas. I can't give it up.”\n\nBreaking the silence on oppression\n\nKant Kaw soon realized that her calling extended beyond reporting events as they unfolded. She felt compelled to disclose the struggles that women in Myanmar face every day.\n\n“I met women who had to carry their fear in silence, yet still found the strength to protect their children and families. They wake up every morning choosing survival. In our conversations, I saw not weakness, but extraordinary strength — especially during moments of political upheaval.”\n\nThrough Kant Kaw’s work, stories that might otherwise have remained untold reached wider audiences. For example, she shone a light on the realities of a young mother in a conflict-affected township who begins each day calculating risk, choosing safer routes to buy food, wondering whether her child’s school will be open, and navigating military checkpoints.\n\nShe also documented moments of collective trauma: village raids where women were detained and interrogated as their children looked on; instances of sexual harassment and threats used to instill fear or extract information. After their release, many survivors remained silent, constrained by stigma and the constant fear of retaliation.\n\nFighting gender bias, one article at a time\n\nInside the newsroom, discrimination seemed unavoidable. Women were routinely underestimated, sidelined, or given fewer opportunities. In response, Kant Kaw pushed herself to excel in her field.\n\n“When I faced discrimination, I used my work to prove that I should not be underestimated as a woman, and I succeeded.”\n\nShe grew bolder, fueled by the writings and achievements of women authors whose strength inspired her more deeply than any male success story could. She is committed to amplifying women’s stories and nurturing their talents, recognizing storytelling as an effective means to do so.\n\nCare as a practice for sustaining the work\n\nYears of reporting, especially in post-coup Myanmar, have taken a toll. These days, she practices intentional self-care to sustain her work: music, hiking, friendships, and proactive emotional problem-solving.\n\nShe gives care as much as she receives it, offering support and presence to friends who struggle. She knows the stakes:\n\n“Women often carry heavier emotional burdens. Without mental resilience, it is easy to break, so I protect myself carefully.”\n\nHer dream of becoming a writer did come true — just not in the way she first imagined. She writes for the public, for women whose voices have been muted by injustice, and continues to write as an act of resistance, a record of truth, and a source of hope.\n\nThrough her writing, she pushes back against silence, against injustice, and against anyone who dares to underestimate what a woman can do.",
