      "summary": "Nicki's eye had collapsed in on itself, but a new gel injection method has saved her vision.",
      "content": "Revolutionary eye injection saved my sight, says first ever patient\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Michelle Roberts and Sophie Hutchinson BBC News Share Save\n\nBBC News Nicki says the results have been life-changing\n\nDoctors say they have achieved the previously impossible - restoring sight and preventing blindness in people with a rare but dangerous eye conditon called hypotony. Moorfields hospital in London is the world's first dedicated clinic for the disorder and seven out of eight patients given the pioneering treatment have responded to the therapy, a pilot study shows. One of them - the first ever - is Nicki Guy, 47, who is sharing her story exclusively with the BBC. She says the results are incredible: \"It's life-changing. It's given me everything back. I can see my child grow up. \"I've gone from counting fingers and everything being really blurry to being able to see.\"\n\nCurrently, she can see and read most lines of letters on an eye test chart. She is one line below what is legally required for driving - a massive change from being partially sighted, using a magnifying glass for anything close up and having to navigate around the house and outside largely using memory. \"If my vision stays like this for the rest of my life it would be absolutely brilliant. \"I may not ever be able to drive again but I'll take that!\" she says.\n\nNicki has regular eye checks to see how she is progressing\n\nWith hypotony, pressure within the eyeball becomes dangerously low, leading it to cave in on itself. It can happen if there is poor production of the natural jelly-like fluid inside the eye, following trauma or inflammation, for example. Sometimes it's a side effect of eye surgery or certain medications. Without treatment people can go blind. Before now, doctors have tried using steroids and silicone oil to plump up the eye. But this can be toxic over long periods and doesn't restore much vision. Even when the cells at the back of the eye used for sight are working, the silicone oil is difficult to see through, causing blurry vision. The experts from Moorfields decided to try a different approach with something they already had in their cupboard - a low-cost, transparent, water-based gel called hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or HPCM. It's already used in some types of eye surgery. But rather than using it as a one-off, the Moorfield's team decided to inject it into the main part of the eye as a new type of therapy.\n\nBBC News The gel is clear or transparent, which allows better vision\n\nWhen Nicki first had eyesight problems back in 2017, just after her son was born, she was initially given lots of silicone oil in her right eye, which was failing. She says it had lost its normal shape and \"sort of collapsed\" or \"crumpled like a paper bag\" due to hypotony. The treatment did little to help. And a few years later, her left eye started to fail in the same way. \"After I lost vision in my left eye, I thought, 'there has to be something else we can try',\" she explains. \"Sheer determination. I was just like 'I'm not giving up'\".\n\nBBC News Mr Harry Petrushkin is trying the treatment in more patients like Nicki\n\nHer eye doctor Mr Harry Petrushkin said, together, they decided to do something entirely new - fill the eye with something that you can see through. \"The idea that we might be causing harm to somebody who has only really one eye with a treatment that may or may not work was nerve-wracking,\" he recalls. \"We came up with this as a solution and amazingly it worked. \"Really, we could not have dreamt of her having the outcome that she has had. \"Somebody, who by all rights should have lost her vision in both eyes... is now living normally. That's completely remarkable. We couldn't have hoped for better.\"",

      "title": "A massive gene hunt reveals how brain cells are made",
      "summary": "A large genetic screen has revealed how stem cells transform into brain cells, exposing hundreds of genes that make this process possible. Among the discoveries is PEDS1, a gene now linked to a previously unknown neurodevelopmental disorder in children. When PEDS1 does not work properly, brain growth and nerve cell formation are impaired. The findings help explain how early genetic changes can shape brain development and disease.",
      "content": "How do embryonic stem cells become brain cells, and which genes make that transformation possible? A new study published on January 5 in Nature Neuroscience tackles this question using powerful gene editing tools. The research was led by Prof. Sagiv Shifman from The Institute of Life Sciences at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in collaboration with Prof. Binnaz Yalcin from INSERM, France. The team used genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens to identify the genes that are essential during the earliest stages of brain development.\n\nThe researchers began with a clear goal: to determine which genes are necessary for brain cells to form correctly.\n\nUsing CRISPR gene-editing technology, they individually disabled nearly 20,000 genes and observed what happened as embryonic stem cells attempted to become brain cells. The experiments were conducted both in stem cells and during their transformation into neural cells. By turning off genes one at a time, the scientists could pinpoint which ones were required for the process to unfold normally.\n\nThis systematic approach allowed the team to outline the major steps of neural differentiation. In total, they identified 331 genes that are critical for producing neurons. Many of these genes had not previously been associated with early brain development. The results provide new insight into the genetic factors that may contribute to neurodevelopmental conditions, including changes in brain size, autism, and developmental delay.\n\nIdentifying a New Gene Linked to Brain Disorders\n\nAmong the most significant findings was the discovery that a gene called PEDS1 is responsible for a previously unknown neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nPEDS1 is needed to produce plasmalogens, a specific type of membrane phospholipid that is especially abundant in myelin, the fatty coating that insulates nerve fibers. The CRISPR screen revealed that PEDS1 also plays a key role in forming nerve cells and that losing the gene results in reduced brain size. Based on these observations, the researchers proposed that a lack of PEDS1 could interfere with brain development in humans.\n\nThat idea was supported by genetic testing in two unrelated families. In both cases, children with severe developmental symptoms were found to carry a rare mutation in PEDS1. The affected children showed developmental delay along with a smaller brain.\n\nConfirming the Role of PEDS1 in Brain Formation\n\nTo determine whether PEDS1 loss directly causes these effects, the researchers turned to experimental models and disabled the gene. These tests confirmed that PEDS1 is required for normal brain development. Without it, nerve cells do not form or migrate properly. These findings help explain the clinical features observed in the children carrying the mutation.\n\nProf. Sagiv Shifman of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at Hebrew University explains: \"By tracking the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neural cells and systematically disrupting nearly all genes in the genome, we created a map of the genes essential for brain development. This map can help us better understand how the brain develops and identify genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders that have yet to be discovered. Identifying PEDS1 as a genetic cause of developmental impairment in children, and clarifying its function, opens the door to improved diagnosis and genetic counseling for families, and may eventually support the development of targeted treatments.\"\n\nHow Gene Function Shapes Inheritance Patterns\n\nThe study also revealed broader trends that may help predict how neurodevelopmental disorders are inherited. Genes that control the activity of other genes, including those involved in transcription and chromatin regulation, are often linked to dominant disorders. In these cases, a mutation in just one copy of the gene can be enough to cause disease.\n\nIn contrast, conditions tied to metabolic genes, including PEDS1, are more often recessive. This means that both copies of the gene must be altered, usually with each parent carrying one changed copy. Recognizing how biological pathways relate to inheritance patterns could help researchers and clinicians identify and prioritize disease related genes.\n\nNew Clues About Autism and Developmental Delay\n\nThe researchers also created an \"essentiality map\" showing when specific genes are required during development. This map helped distinguish between the genetic mechanisms linked to autism and those linked to developmental delay.\n\nGenes that are essential across many stages of development were more strongly connected to developmental delay. Meanwhile, genes that are especially important during the formation of nerve cells were more closely associated with autism. These findings help explain why different genetic disruptions can lead to overlapping symptoms and support the idea that early changes in brain development can contribute to autism.\n\nOpen Data for the Research Community\n\nThe research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (ISF), the ISF-Broad Institute Program, and the MAVRI Biomedical Research Program.\n\nTo support future discoveries, the team has launched an open online database that contains the results of the study, allowing researchers around the world to explore the data:\n\nhttps://aa-shifman.shinyapps.io/Neuro_Diff_Screen/\n\nProf. Shifman added: \"This was an excellent idea from PhD student Alana Amelan, who carried out a large part of the study and also created the website. We wanted our findings to serve the entire scientific community, supporting ongoing work on the genes we identified and helping researchers pinpoint additional genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.\"\n\nA Foundation for Future Brain Research\n\nOverall, the study delivers a detailed genetic map of early nervous system development and sheds light on the molecular basis of a newly identified brain disorder.\n\nThese findings may improve genetic diagnosis for neurodevelopmental conditions and help guide future research aimed at prevention and treatment.",

      "title": "Injection turns sleeping tumor immune cells into cancer fighters",
      "summary": "KAIST researchers have developed a way to reprogram immune cells already inside tumors into cancer-killing machines. A drug injected directly into the tumor is absorbed by macrophages, prompting them to recognize and attack cancer cells while activating nearby immune defenses. This eliminates the need for lab-based cell extraction and modification. In animal models, the strategy significantly slowed tumor growth and sparked strong anticancer immune responses.",
      "content": "Tumors in the human body contain immune cells called macrophages that are naturally capable of attacking cancer. However, the tumor environment suppresses these cells, preventing them from doing their job. Researchers at KAIST have now found a way to overcome this barrier by directly transforming immune cells already inside tumors into active cancer-fighting therapies.\n\nKAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on the 30th that a research team led by Professor Ji-Ho Park from the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering has developed a new treatment approach. When a drug is injected directly into a tumor, macrophages already present in the body absorb the drug and begin producing CAR (a cancer-recognizing device) proteins. This process converts them into anticancer immune cells known as \"CAR-macrophages.\"\n\nWhy Solid Tumors Are So Hard to Treat\n\nSolid tumors -- including gastric, lung, and liver cancers -- form dense structures that block immune cells from entering or functioning effectively. Because of this physical and biological barrier, many existing immune cell therapies struggle to work well against these types of cancers.\n\nCAR-macrophages have emerged as a promising next-generation immunotherapy. Unlike some immune cells, macrophages can directly engulf and destroy cancer cells. They also stimulate nearby immune cells, helping to amplify the body's overall anticancer response.\n\nDespite their potential, current CAR-macrophage therapies rely on extracting immune cells from a patient's blood, growing them in the lab, and genetically modifying them before reinfusion. This process is slow, expensive, and difficult to scale, which limits its practicality for many patients.\n\nReprogramming Immune Cells Directly Inside the Body\n\nTo bypass these challenges, the KAIST team focused on \"tumor-associated macrophages\" that naturally gather around tumors. The researchers developed a method to reprogram these cells directly inside the body rather than modifying them outside it.\n\nTheir approach uses lipid nanoparticles -- engineered to be easily taken up by macrophages -- loaded with both mRNA that carries cancer-recognition instructions and an immune-activating compound.\n\nAs described by the researchers, this method creates CAR-macrophages by \"directly converting the body's own macrophages into anticancer cell therapies inside the body.\"\n\nStrong Tumor Suppression in Animal Studies\n\nWhen the treatment was injected into tumors, macrophages quickly absorbed the nanoparticles and began producing proteins that identify cancer cells. At the same time, immune signaling was activated. The resulting \"enhanced CAR-macrophages\" showed much stronger cancer-killing ability and stimulated surrounding immune cells, leading to a powerful anticancer response.\n\nIn animal models of melanoma (the most dangerous form of skin cancer), tumor growth was significantly reduced. The researchers also found evidence that the immune response could extend beyond the treated tumor, suggesting the potential for broader, body-wide immune protection.\n\nA New Direction for Cancer Immunotherapy\n\nProfessor Ji-Ho Park said, \"This study presents a new concept of immune cell therapy that generates anticancer immune cells directly inside the patient's body.\" He added that \"it is particularly meaningful in that it simultaneously overcomes the key limitations of existing CAR-macrophage therapies -- delivery efficiency and the immunosuppressive tumor environment.\"\n\nStudy Details and Funding\n\nThe study was led by Jun-Hee Han, Ph.D., from the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering at KAIST as the first author. The findings were published on November 18 in ACS Nano, an international journal focused on nanotechnology.\n\nThe research was supported by the Mid-Career Researcher Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Solid tumors like lung, liver, and stomach cancers are hard to treat because they block immune cells from working properly. Inside these tumors, immune cells called macrophages can fight cancer but are usually stopped by the tumor environment.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at KAIST developed a way to inject a special drug directly into tumors. This drug is taken up by macrophages inside the tumor and changes them into cancer-fighting cells called CAR-macrophages. These reprogrammed cells then attack cancer and activate other immune defenses nearby.\n\n**Impact** – This method avoids the usual need to remove immune cells from the body, change them in a lab, and put them back. It works faster and could be less expensive. In animal tests, the treatment slowed tumor growth and triggered strong immune responses, showing promise for treating tough cancers.\n\n**What’s next step** – Scientists will likely continue testing this treatment in more animal studies and eventually in human trials to see if it works safely and effectively in people.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Injecting a drug into tumors can transform immune cells inside the body into powerful cancer fighters without complex lab steps.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les tumeurs solides comme celles du poumon, du foie ou de l’estomac sont difficiles à traiter car elles empêchent les cellules immunitaires de fonctionner correctement. Dans ces tumeurs, des cellules immunitaires appelées macrophages peuvent combattre le cancer, mais elles sont souvent bloquées par l’environnement tumoral.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs de KAIST ont mis au point un médicament à injecter directement dans les tumeurs. Ce médicament est absorbé par les macrophages présents dans la tumeur et les transforme en cellules appelées CAR-macrophages, capables d’attaquer le cancer et d’activer d’autres défenses immunitaires proches.\n\n**Impact** – Cette méthode évite de devoir retirer les cellules immunitaires, les modifier en laboratoire puis les réinjecter. Elle est plus rapide et pourrait coûter moins cher. Chez les animaux, ce traitement a ralenti la croissance des tumeurs et déclenché une forte réponse immunitaire, ce qui est prometteur pour les cancers difficiles à traiter.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques vont poursuivre les tests sur les animaux et envisager des essais cliniques chez l’humain pour vérifier son efficacité et sa sécurité.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Injecter un médicament dans les tumeurs peut transformer les cellules immunitaires en puissants combattants du cancer sans étapes complexes en laboratoire.",
