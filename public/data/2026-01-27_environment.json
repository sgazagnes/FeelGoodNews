      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 26 January 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00246-zActionable goals are needed to guide the world towards what needs to happen most quickly: shifting economies to clean energy sources.",
      "content": "On 28 October 2025, United Nations secretary-general António Guterres acknowledged that the totemic goal of the Paris climate agreement is going to be missed: “The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5 °C in the next few years”1.\n\nApproaching 1.5 °C: how will we know we’ve reached this crucial warming mark?\n\nGuterres was merely stating the obvious. In 2024, Earth’s global mean surface temperature averaged 1.55 °C above pre-industrial levels2, and the average for 2023–25 is 1.48 °C, perilously close to the limit. Keeping to the Paris target now looks impossible by any realistic measure. Yet this moment should not invite despair. Instead, it demands an urgent reframing of how climate progress is measured and mobilized.\n\nThe world today looks very different from that in 2015 when the Paris goal was framed. Although emissions are still rising and global actions on climate change are slow, a lot of progress has been made. Clean energy is expanding rapidly and decarbonization, not fossil fuels, is the new ‘business as usual’. In the first three quarters of 2025, growth in clean electricity generation outpaced that in energy demand for the first time, implying that fossil fuels are being displaced (see go.nature.com/3jvqzcb).\n\nWe argue that the main focus of climate action in 2026 and beyond should be on accelerating the clean-energy revolution. And the rate at which clean energy displaces fossil fuels in the global economy should become the key measure of climate progress. Here we describe how such progress can be tracked and incentivized using a metric we call the clean-energy shift. Unlike chasing intangible temperature targets, cleaning up the energy sector is a more-focused battle that the world can win.\n\nBeyond average temperatures\n\nTo move forwards, climate scientists and policymakers must first accept that the Paris 1.5 °C target has outlived its usefulness. Although initially valuable as a unifying focus for international efforts to increase mitigation, continuing to emphasize a failed temperature target might produce more harm than good.\n\nOne reason is the difficulty of determining when and whether the world has crossed the line. Forecasts suggest that Earth is likely to exceed the 1.5 °C threshold around 2028, for instance (see go.nature.com/4pf95x6). But in the terminology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “exceedance” of 1.5 °C refers to the midpoint of a 20-year period at that level3. Confirmation would therefore not come until a decade after the fact.\n\nEnvironmental treaties are paralysed — here’s how we can do better\n\nSuch a target, requiring years of expert interpretation to assess, could never have great salience for decision makers. And it challenges public understanding because, by definition, no person experiences global average temperatures. Moving to a higher number when 1.5 °C is crossed, such as 1.6 °C or 1.7 °C, would only make climate target setting seem arbitrary and unrooted in scientific evidence.\n\nMore concerningly, the emphasis on keeping Earth’s temperature below 1.5 °C might serve to justify risky interventions in the climate system. For example, injecting vast amounts of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere through ‘solar radiation modification’ could be one of the few remaining ways to bring 1.5 °C back into reach. But it might also alter precipitation patterns or result in a burst of warming if the programme were suddenly halted.\n\nMore complex temperature targets won’t help. Discussions have begun around the concept of ‘overshoot’, in which the planet’s average temperature would be brought back to 1.5 °C by 2100 after a period exceeding that level4. But its achievement would be even harder to pin down. While in overshoot, no one can be sure whether it is permanent or temporary. A successful return to 1.5 °C could be confirmed only at the end of the century.\n\nAny approach based on projections to 2100 is unlikely to inspire public interest or political action because the goal is so far off. It is hubristic to think that researchers can predict accurately how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will affect the climate, or how Earth’s climate system itself will respond to unprecedented conditions.\n\nThe clean-energy shift\n\nInstead, we propose that policymakers focus on rapidly building the clean-energy systems that can deliver the safer climate and thriving economies that populations demand. These goals are already agreed. For example, in 2023 at the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) 28 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, countries called for a tripling of renewable-energy capacity globally by 2030 and the transition away from fossil fuels to reach net zero by 2050. Whereas delegates at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, in 2025, struggled to agree to phase out fossil fuels, support for accelerating clean energy is almost universal.\n\nTo fulfil this mandate, the world needs one clear number with which to measure climate progress during a transition that ends the use of fossil fuels. We think the most promising metric is one we term the ‘clean-energy shift’. Building on a concept initially proposed by Bloomberg New Energy Finance founder Michael Liebreich (see go.nature.com/3zr5y1), we define it as the growth rate in clean-energy generation minus the growth rate in total energy demand for a given time interval.\n\nThis metric emphasizes that clean-energy supply must expand faster than overall energy demand for decarbonization. When the percentage growth of clean-energy supply exceeds the growth in total energy use, fossil fuels get squeezed out of the system. By contrast, simply measuring clean energy share is insufficient, because fossil fuels might also rise overall to meet extra demand.\n\nClouds of steam emanate from a geothermal plant in Iceland.Credit: Getty\n\nFor example, if clean-energy grows by 6% each year and total energy demand grows by 3%, the clean-energy shift is +3%, meaning that clean energy is displacing fossil energy as a share of total energy generation. The bigger the number, the faster the exit from fossil fuels.\n\nClean-energy shift measures progress in a positive way5, towards a 100% clean economy, rather than negatively towards net zero. This would reduce the political resistance that arises from the perceived economic sacrifice of limiting emissions. Chasing the number zero will never motivate politicians concerned about economic development. Framing decarbonization as a story of building clean-energy industries and jobs is more appealing. The metric points to policies that are politically feasible, economically desirable and already advancing rapidly technologically, including solar, wind, batteries, geothermal, hydro and nuclear — without picking winners.\n\nThe power of pursuing this approach is evident in recent energy trends. Between 2018 and 2020, the annual percentage growth of clean-energy generation rose sharply, driven by rapid additions of solar, wind and storage capacities. Total global energy demand also grew, but at a slower rate, implying that growth in clean-energy production began eating into the share of fossil fuels. If this clean-energy shift can be increased further, the world would see a peak and then a steady decline in fossil-fuel use and related emissions. Indeed, data from China suggest the nation’s emissions peak could come as soon as this year6.\n\nIt is up to policymakers to determine how high the clean-energy shift should be. For example, to eliminate fossil fuels by 2050, the metric would need to rise substantially, from around 4% over the past five years, and keep climbing through the 2030s and 2040s. This means that clean-energy generation must continue its current rapid growth, rising several percentage points faster than total energy demand each year.\n\nAlthough challenging, trends in solar, wind and storage deployment suggest that this acceleration is achievable — although it will require expanded manufacturing capacity, grids built to integrate renewable technologies, continued reductions in battery costs and political will.\n\nClimbing the climate ladder\n\nTo achieve global decarbonization by 2050, policymakers need short-term milestones. We suggest they might set global targets of clean-energy shifts in five-year intervals — like rungs on a ladder, each climbing closer to a safe climate. It should be noted that the intervals are non-linear in terms of added capacity: because clean-energy shift is a percentage-growth metric, the higher rungs reflect increasingly rapid rates of clean-energy expansion, rather than a constant yearly addition.\n\nEncouragingly, the world has already climbed the first two rungs. We calculate an average shift of about 3.4% during 2014–19, rising to about 5.7% in 2024. The next rungs would need to sustain or increase these numbers to enable a fossil-fuels exit by 2050. Lower numbers would mean fossil fuels staying longer as part of the energy mix.\n\nClimate change is devastating mining of minerals needed to fight it\n\nThese intervals can be aligned with the five-year timelines used by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policy process, such as major COP agreements, reviews of ‘nationally determined contributions’ and ‘global stocktakes’ of progress towards the Paris goals for emissions reductions.\n\nThe clean-energy shift metric also respects long-established UN principles of equity and accountability, including the concept of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ in climate policy. The metric would not be a legally binding top-down number but the upward product of the collective efforts of all countries, which would continue to determine their own energy policies.\n\nIndividual countries can use the metric to track their own progress. And several major emitters already include clean-energy targets in their Paris commitments. For example, India met its 50% non-fossil power capacity goal five years ahead of its 2030 target. China has more than doubled its wind and solar capacity over the past three years. The European Union currently has about one-quarter of its energy consumption supplied by renewable sources, which it has mandated should rise to 42.5% within five years.\n\nFossil focus\n\nNo metric can cover everything. And the clean-energy shift excludes emissions from sources other than fossil fuels, such as greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation, soil cultivation or wildfires. But the climate damage caused by fossil fuels is unique in its scale — comprising 90% of the carbon dioxide problem (38 of 42 gigatonnes in 2024)7.",

NOAA\n\nSpace-based technology could help track plastic and other flotsam by its ‘fingerprints.’\n\nIn late 2025, scientists reported that, for the first time, they were able to detect concentrations of plastic pollution on land using NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor aboard the International Space Station. The technology has inspired marine researchers to see whether it could also help track debris in our waters.\n\nBefore future generations of sensors like EMIT can be called upon to detect ocean litter, scientists need to know what to look for. Working with collaborators, NASA intern Ashley Ohall has built a newly published reference library containing nearly 25,000 molecular “fingerprints” from all manner of flotsam and jetsam, including rope, tires, metal, bubble wrap, buoys, and bottle caps. Given the overwhelming presence of plastic in marine debris, the library includes some 19 types of polymer.\n\nNASA’s EMIT, shown in the red circle, was launched to the International Space Station in 2022 to map minerals. Its data is now advancing fields from agriculture to water science. NASA\n\nMost of the estimated 8 million tons or more of plastic that enter the ocean every year comes from land, so mapping pollution hot spots near coastlines could be a first step toward reducing what ends up on beaches and washed out to sea. That’s exactly what NASA’s sensor showed it could do, though detecting plastic wasn’t its first mission. Launched in 2022, EMIT maps minerals across desert regions to help determine how the dust can heat or cool the atmosphere.\n\nBut the instrument has proved itself incredibly nimble. From its perch on the space station, it can identify hundreds of compounds on Earth via the unique spectral patterns they make in reflected sunlight. The technology behind EMIT, called imaging spectroscopy, was pioneered at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and is used on missions throughout the solar system. One of EMIT’s cousins discovered lunar water in 2009, and another is set to return to the Moon to help future astronauts identify scientifically valuable areas to sample.\n\nMarine scientist Ashley Ohall checked out aircraft at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, during her recent internship with the agency in which she led the creation of a spectral library containing nearly 25,000 molecular “fingerprints” from all manner of debris. Kelsey Bisson\n\nThe same technology has now shown that it can find plastic compounds in landfills and large-scale structures like greenhouses, said JPL’s David Thompson, who coauthored the 2025 study. However, detecting plastic once it enters the ocean is more challenging: Seawater absorbs infrared light, masking many of plastic’s prominent spectral features.\n\nLitter library\n\nThat’s where the work of Ohall and her collaborators comes in. Their open-source library compiles the work of many researchers over the years who’ve analyzed marine debris using handheld instruments in laboratories. Standardizing the various datasets into one searchable repository is crucial because different kinds of debris have slightly different spectra based on material, color, and condition. Weathered water bottles, for example, “look” different than washed-up hurricane detritus. Once the patterns are known, detection algorithms can be developed.\n\nCarried by ocean currents, debris can travel thousands of miles from the source, so a better understanding of where it is and where it’s headed could be a boon for public health and coastal tourism, said Ohall, a Florida native who recently graduated from the University of Georgia.\n\n“My biggest hope is that people see remote sensing as an important and useful tool for marine debris monitoring,” Ohall said. “Just because it hasn’t been done yet doesn’t mean it can’t be done.”\n\nPlanet-scale challenge\n\nConventional methods for quantifying plastic in the ocean — including dragging nets through garbage patches — can’t sample the millions of tons that flow in. With NASA’s support, scientists are learning more about the ability of existing sensors as well as what’s still needed to spot marine debris. Teams are also training AI tools to sift through satellite imagery.\n\nIt remains a planet-scale endeavor, said Kelsey Bisson, a program manager at NASA Headquarters in Washington. The groundwork being done by Ohall and other scientists brings us a step closer to leveraging a powerful technology flying in air and space today.\n\n“Humans have a visceral connection to the ocean and its health,” Bisson said. “Detecting marine debris is the kind of incredible challenge that NASA can help solve.”\n\nTo learn more about EMIT, visit:\n\nhttps://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/\n\nMedia Contacts\n\nAndrew Wang / Andrew Good\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n\n626-379-6874 / 818-393-2433\n\nandrew.wang@jpl.nasa.gov / andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nWritten by Sally Younger\n\n2026-003",

Climate change is reshaping where crops can grow, trade disputes threaten supply chains, and smallholder farmers who produce much of our food often have the least power in the system. Meet Heather Terry, founder and CEO of GoodSAM Foods, and discover how the company is transforming the traditional smallhold farm model by putting people and regenerative agriculture at the heart of a growing food company. GoodSAM Foods sources 90% of its ingredients directly from smallholder farms in Latin America and Africa, eliminating middlemen and reinvesting profits into farming communities. Terry’s approach is both principled and pragmatic: as climate volatility reduces crop yields globally, the companies that have built genuine relationships with farmers will have access to limited harvests. “When I’m a farmer and I suddenly have leverage, who am I going to sell that product to?” Terry asks. “It’s relationships.”\n\nTerry’s journey to raise $9 million in Series A funding over 18 months illustrates the disconnect between traditional investors and regenerative business models. After facing skepticism from conventional CPG investors, she found success with impact investors who understood that sustainable food systems represent the future of the industry. While GoodSAM maintains USDA Organic and Non-GMO Project verification, Terry takes a critical stance on regenerative certification labels, arguing that current systems impose Global North standards on farmers who have practiced regenerative techniques for generations. Instead, GoodSAM focuses on direct relationships and on-ground verification. Her proactive approach protected both the company and its farming partners from sudden economic shocks at a time when the U.S. food system faces mounting pressures from climate impacts and trade policy changes. “Every time you pick something up off the shelf, you are voting,” Terry said. “You’re sending a signal to a company.”\n\nYou can learn more about GoodSAM Foods at goodsamfoods.com.\n\nSubscribe to Sustainability In Your Ear on iTunes\n\nFollow Sustainability In Your Ear on Spreaker, iHeartRadio, or YouTube\n\nEditor’s Note: This episode originally aired on September 22, 2025.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nEach winter, the Bay of Biscay sadly becomes a hotspot for tragedy and loss for dolphins. These highly intelligent marine mammals migrate into the region just as fishing activity intensifies, creating a dangerously deadly overlap. For years, hundreds of dolphins have washed ashore on the coasts of France and Spain, many bearing the unmistakable scars of accidental capture in fishing nets.\n\nBut this year, Europe is hitting pause again.\n\nThe European Commission announced that it will reintroduce a seasonal fishing ban in early 2026, following positive results from similar restrictions in previous years. The temporary closure, set to run from 22 January to 20 February, will apply to vessels over eight metres in length operating in the Bay of Biscay.\n\nThe aim is simple: give dolphins a fighting chance during the most dangerous time of year.\n\nA proven solution that’s gaining momentum\n\nThis will be the third winter in a row that the European Union has applied this type of closure in the region. What’s changed is the tone of the conversation: unlike past years filled with uncertainty and pushback, this time, the results are speaking for themselves.\n\nIn 2025, dolphin mortality dropped significantly, according to data cited by the Commission. That success is being used as a clear justification to repeat the measure.\n\n“This isn’t just theory—it’s evidence-based policy,” noted one official involved in the rollout.\n\nFor researchers at PELAGIS, a French marine observatory that has tracked cetacean deaths for years, the move represents long-awaited validation of what their data has long shown: that reducing fishing activity during key migration periods works.\n\nBalancing conservation with livelihoods\n\nThe ban will affect approximately 300 vessels across EU member states, disrupting business for many small and medium-scale fisheries. The Commission acknowledges the economic cost but has made support available.\n\nTo soften the blow, impacted fishers will be eligible for compensation through the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, along with potential national aid. The goal is to ensure that conservation does not come at the expense of coastal communities’ stability.\n\nThis balance between environmental protection and economic resilience is central to the EU’s approach.\n\nTech, oversight, and year-round safeguards\n\nThe winter closure is not a one-note solution. It’s part of a broader strategy to make fishing more dolphin-friendly throughout the year.\n\nSeveral policies already in place will continue into 2026:\n\nAcoustic deterrent devices (pingers) are required on certain vessels year-round. These devices emit sound frequencies to warn off cetaceans before they come too close to nets.\n\nExpanded monitoring programs, including the deployment of on-board observers and video camera systems, are being scaled up to track interactions between marine life and fishing gear.\n\nThese tools help ensure that protective measures don’t rely solely on seasonal bans, but instead embed safeguards into the fabric of day-to-day operations.\n\nA model for pragmatic conservation\n\nAt its heart, this recurring closure is an example of pragmatic, measurable environmental action. This elegant solution is one that acknowledges both the urgency of wildlife conservation and the realities of the fishing industry.\n\nBy limiting fishing activity during peak risk periods, while offering financial support and expanding monitoring, the EU is carving out a middle path that other regions may look to replicate.\n\nDolphins, it seems, are already responding to that lifeline. And as policymakers and communities gear up for 2026, the hope is that this seasonal pause becomes more than a band-aid solution, but perhaps even a blueprint.\n\nDid this solution stand out?

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Every winter, many dolphins migrate to the Bay of Biscay, a sea area near France and Spain. At the same time, fishing activity increases there, which has caused many dolphins to get caught in fishing nets and die.\n\n**What happened** – The European Union (EU) has announced it will bring back a fishing ban in the Bay of Biscay from January 22 to February 20, 2026. This ban will apply to fishing boats longer than eight meters. It follows previous bans that helped reduce dolphin deaths during this dangerous time.\n\n**Impact** – This is the third year in a row the EU is using this seasonal ban because it has worked. Dolphin deaths dropped a lot in 2025, showing that stopping fishing for a short time can save many animals. At the same time, the EU is supporting fishermen who lose money during the ban by giving them financial help.\n\n**What's next step** – Besides the winter ban, the EU will keep using sound devices on boats to warn dolphins and increase monitoring with cameras and observers. These actions help protect dolphins all year round, not just during the ban. The EU hopes this approach can be a model for other places with similar problems.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU’s seasonal fishing ban and added protections are helping dolphins survive in the Bay of Biscay, while also supporting fishing communities during the closure.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Chaque hiver, de nombreux dauphins migrent vers la baie de Biscaye, une zone maritime proche de la France et de l’Espagne. En même temps, la pêche augmente, ce qui a causé la mort de nombreux dauphins piégés dans les filets.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – L’Union européenne (UE) a annoncé qu’elle réintroduira une interdiction de pêche dans la baie de Biscaye du 22 janvier au 20 février 2026. Cette interdiction concernera les bateaux de pêche de plus de huit mètres. Elle fait suite à des fermetures similaires qui ont déjà réduit les décès de dauphins.\n\n**Impact** – C’est la troisième année consécutive que l’UE applique cette interdiction saisonnière car elle a fait ses preuves. En 2025, la mortalité des dauphins a fortement diminué, montrant que l’arrêt temporaire de la pêche peut sauver beaucoup d’animaux. En même temps, l’UE aide financièrement les pêcheurs qui perdent des revenus pendant cette période.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – En plus de l’interdiction hivernale, l’UE continuera d’utiliser des dispositifs sonores sur les bateaux pour avertir les dauphins et renforcera la surveillance avec des caméras et des observateurs. Ces mesures protègent les dauphins toute l’année, pas seulement pendant l’interdiction. L’UE espère que cette méthode servira de modèle ailleurs.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – L’interdiction saisonnière de pêche de l’UE et les protections supplémentaires aident les dauphins à survivre dans la baie de Biscaye tout en soutenant les communautés de pêcheurs.\n",

Al mismo tiempo, la pesca aumenta, lo que ha provocado la muerte de muchos delfines atrapados en las redes.\n\n**Qué pasó** – La Unión Europea (UE) anunció que volverá a imponer una prohibición de pesca en el Golfo de Vizcaya del 22 de enero al 20 de febrero de 2026. Esta prohibición afectará a los barcos de pesca de más de ocho metros. Se basa en cierres anteriores que ayudaron a reducir la muerte de delfines.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta es la tercera vez consecutiva que la UE aplica esta prohibición temporal porque ha demostrado ser efectiva. En 2025, las muertes de delfines bajaron mucho, mostrando que detener la pesca por poco tiempo puede salvar muchos animales. Al mismo tiempo, la UE apoya económicamente a los pescadores afectados.\n\n**Próximos pasos** – Además de la prohibición de invierno, la UE seguirá usando dispositivos sonoros en los barcos para avisar a los delfines y aumentará la vigilancia con cámaras y observadores. Estas medidas ayudan a proteger a los delfines durante todo el año, no solo durante la prohibición. La UE espera que este método sea un modelo para otras regiones.\n\n**Una frase para recordar** – La prohibición temporal de pesca y las protecciones adicionales de la UE están ayudando a que los delfines sobrevivan en el Golfo de Vizcaya, mientras apoyan a las comunidades pesqueras.\n",
