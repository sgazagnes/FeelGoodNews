      "summary": "The Government will make 17,000 rural properties owned by the State available to young people",
      "content": "Madrid – The President of the Government, Pedro Sánchez, has announced the launch of a package of measures to promote the “urgent” challenge of generational renewal in Spanish agriculture and livestock farming, with the creation of “Tierra Joven”, a platform for information and mobilization of agricultural land, while at the same time proposing that the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) allocate 10% of its resources to generational renewal in the agricultural sector.\n\n“The Government is going to decisively support young people who want to choose this path, giving them every facility and opportunity to apply their talent and to undertake. Bringing young people into this sector is worthwhile for us as a country, because they are the present and the future of our countryside,” said Sánchez, who reiterated the need to give the “highest priority” to this “urgent” and “necessary” challenge of generational renewal in rural areas.\n\nHe announced this during the closing of the event presenting the measures to facilitate young people’s access to agricultural activity, held at the iHub La Vega Innova, in San Fernando de Henares (Madrid), which was attended by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Luis Planas.\n\nSánchez, who met with young farmers and livestock breeders, recalled that 40% of the holders of agricultural holdings in Spain are over 65 years of age and only 9% are under 41, a “phenomenon common to many other neighboring countries”, and stressed that the motivation behind the Strategy for Generational Renewal in Agriculture, driven by the Commission, has set the objective of doubling the proportion of young farmers in the EU by 2040.\n\n“When young people join this sector, there are more productive farms, more added value, more employment, more innovation and more sustainability,” he emphasized.\n\nMobilization of 17,000 state-owned rural properties\n\nAmong the measures announced by the President of the Government, the mobilization of agricultural land owned by the State also stands out, which he put at around 17,000 rural properties, to make them available to young people through the “Tierra Joven” platform. “This is a measure similar to what we have done in housing policy, where we have told all the Ministries to look at what land they have in order to make it available for a common cause, such as the construction of housing,” he specified.\n\nSánchez announced that a process of dialogue will be opened with the autonomous communities, with the sector and with all stakeholders to agree on a model that facilitates young people’s access to this land.\n\n“We are going to lead by example, we are not going to stand aside from this challenge, because we are going to lead this platform by pooling these properties, giving preference to young people and women, so that this land can be turned into projects that generate jobs and economic activity,” he stressed.\n\nAmong the measures announced by the Government, the launch of the “Tierra Joven” platform stands out, which aims to tackle the “major obstacle” to the effective incorporation of young people into the agricultural sector, namely access to land.\n\nThis Platform for Information and Mobilization of Agricultural Land, which will be led by the Ministry of Agriculture, in collaboration with the sector, the autonomous communities and other ministries involved, will make it possible to disseminate supply and demand, and will offer homogeneous, transparent and unified information on the agricultural land market in Spain.\n\nAs he explained, it will be launched “immediately” during the first months of the year, with the approval of a royal decree regulating its contents, and it will be consolidated in the future Family Farming Law, with the creation of an Office for Information and Transfer of Agricultural Land, similar to those that exist in other countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Belgium or Poland.\n\nAllocating 10% of the CAP to generational renewal\n\nIn addition, the Government is going to propose that the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) allocate 10% of its resources to generational renewal, well above the 6% proposed by the European Commission.\n\n“Spain is defending that the EU budget should be 2% of the available gross national income. We are very much alone because there are many governments that, under that false argument of the renationalization of competences and a false recovery of sovereignty, are actually weakening the EU budget. We must advocate a pro-European discourse; the EU budgets must be larger because the challenges are increasingly greater and more pressing,” argued Sánchez.\n\nSpain will not allow the CAP to be weakened\n\nThe President of the Government reiterated that the CAP “is and must continue to be one of the best legacies of the European project and is, above all, an investment in security and sovereignty.” “Those who advocate the renationalization of EU policies must know that the CAP is the first common European policy and pro-European governments, such as that of Spain, will never allow the CAP to be weakened,” he stressed.\n\n“I insist on a budget that necessarily has to be larger and that must represent 2%, because there are governments that are advocating 5% for other things, so let us defend 2% for the EU budget,” he stated during his speech.\n\nThe President of the Government also recalled the 40th anniversary of Spain’s accession to the European Union, which has served to “make progress, modernize, build social and territorial cohesion thanks to funds that unfortunately are now being called into question, due to the proposal that has been made by the European Commission, such as the Cohesion Funds or the CAP.” (14 January)",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nMany farmers in Spain are older than 65, while only a small number are under 41. This creates a challenge for the future of farming, as fewer young people are working in agriculture. The European Union wants to double the number of young farmers by 2040.\n\n**What happened**\nSpain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, announced new measures to support young people who want to become farmers. The government will offer 17,000 rural properties owned by the state to young farmers through a new platform called “Tierra Joven.” This platform will provide clear information about available farmland. Sánchez also proposed that 10% of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget be dedicated to helping young farmers, which is higher than the 6% suggested by the European Commission.\n\n**Impact**\nThese actions make it easier for young people to access land and start farming, which is often a big obstacle. By supporting young farmers, Spain expects more productive and sustainable farms, new jobs, and more innovation in rural areas. Using state-owned land helps create opportunities without waiting for private landowners. The plan also emphasizes support for women farmers.\n\n**What's next step**\nThe government will work with regional authorities, farming groups, and other stakeholders to agree on how best to manage and distribute the land. The “Tierra Joven” platform will be launched soon, backed by a royal decree and later included in a new Family Farming Law. Spain will continue pushing in the EU for a larger budget to support agriculture and rural development.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nSpain is making state land and EU funds available to young farmers to renew its agricultural sector and create more rural jobs and sustainability.",

However, back home farmers’ fury is mounting and some member states are already gearing up to block the Mercosur vote in the European Parliament.\n\nHave the article read by OpenAI (Beta). Please note that AI translations may take some time to process. Please note that AI translations may take some time to process.\n\nA majority of European Union countries gave the go-ahead on Friday for the bloc to sign the Mercosur free trade deal with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay after decades of negotiations and a last-minute postponement just before Christmas.\n\nDuring the meeting of EU member state ambassadors in Brussels, five governments opposed the agreement – France, Poland, Austria, Hungary and Ireland –, while Belgium abstained. The previous stalemate back in December was broken with the “yes” of Italy, which, after receiving final guarantees, resolved its reservations.\n\nTherefore, on Saturday, January 17, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are to travel to Paraguay’s capital Asunción – since the country is currently holding the rotating Mercosur presidency – to formally sign the treaty.\n\nAccording to the Commission President, this step establishes Europe as a “reliable partner”, able to “chart its own course”. Von der Leyen also stated that “today Europe has sent a strong signal that we are serious about (…) our commitment to diversify our trade and reduce our dependencies”.\n\nThe agreement was also welcomed in South America, with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva calling it an historic day for multilateralism. “Against the backdrop of an increasingly protectionist and unilateral international environment, the agreement is a signal for international trade as a factor for economic growth, from which both blocs will profit,” he said.\n\nHowever, the deal still has to be approved by a majority of MEPs in the European Parliament, where voting coalitions have become more volatile and unpredictable. A date has not yet been announced. Farmers remain strongly opposed, with groups such as the Irish Farmers’ Association saying they were working on torpedoing the agreement in parliament.\n\nIf ratified, the new free trade zone, with more than 700 million inhabitants, would be the largest of its kind in the world, according to the European Commission. It is estimated that the agreement could increase annual EU exports to Mercosur countries by up to 39 percent, or 49 billion Euro, which could support more than 440,000 jobs across Europe.\n\nToday’s Council decision to support the EU-Mercosur deal is historic.\n\n\n\nEurope is sending a strong signal.\n\n\n\nWe are serious about creating growth, jobs and securing the interests of Europeans consumers and businesses.\n\n\n\nWith Mercosur, we are creating a shared market of 700 million… pic.twitter.com/WMGXWzFgua — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) January 9, 2026\n\nMercosur’s heavyweight backers\n\nLast year, the EU’s trade dispute with the United States brought new momentum to the stalled process, with European countries wanting to demonstrate that fair trade is not a thing of the past.\n\nGerman industry had been pushing for years for the deal to be concluded. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed Friday’s breakthrough as a “milestone in European trade policy and an important signal of our strategic sovereignty and ability to act”.\n\nIn particular, the automotive industry, mechanical engineering and the pharmaceutical sector stand to benefit. Car imports to Mercosur countries are currently subject to a 35 percent tariff, for example.\n\nDeloitte economist David Marek said this was an important moment at a time when markets are focusing more on protecting the domestic market from foreign competition. Within the European market, competition would also increase, which could lead to efforts to reduce product prices and improve their quality.\n\nAccording to XTB investment platform analyst Pavel Peterka, Czechia is one of the biggest winners of this agreement, whose automotive sector, like Germany, will benefit greatly.\n\nSpain is one of the countries which pushed the most to have this deal done. Its Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez welcomed the agreement, which will enable “Spanish companies to enter new markets, export more and generate more employment”.\n\nIn a message on social media, Sánchez highlighted the importance of an agreement that will allow the EU to “maintain a strong link with Latin America, a sister and strategic region”, in a world where “not everything is tariffs, threats and bad news”. He then insisted that this pact builds “new bridges and alliances” to forge “shared prosperity” with the countries of the Southern Cone.\n\nNeighbouring Portugal, also a supporter of the deal, highlighted its significant impact on the country and the Union.\n\nMinister of Agriculture and the Sea José Manuel Fernandes, stressed that, given the geopolitical situation, this agreement was essential, highlighting “great opportunities” for products such as wine, olive oil and cheese. He also pointed out that there is a 500 million Euro deficit in the trade balance with Mercosur and that this agreement will make it possible to settle this amount.\n\nDenmark is another advocate of free trade in the EU, and its government wholeheartedly supports the Mercosur agreement. “This is a huge breakthrough. Also for Denmark, which as a small, open economy is dependent on trade with other countries,” said Jacob Jensen, the Danish minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries.\n\nDenmark had hoped that the agreement could be finalised during the Danish EU Presidency, which ran until December 31. This did not happen, but the minister was pleased that the EU was now taking a step towards opening new markets after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on European goods.\n\nNeighbouring Sweden has also been a longtime supporter, with Trade Minister Benjamin Dousa saying he was looking forward to better export opportunities for the car and medicine industry, among others, and also lower consumer prices and for more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to start trading with the Mercosur countries.\n\n“For many of them it has been technically complicated and too expensive to hire lawyers in order to export to Brazil (for instance),” Dousa said.\n\nLegitimate farmers’ concerns\n\nNevertheless, the European Commission, which negotiated the text, failed to win over all of the bloc’s member states.\n\nHeavyweight France, where politicians across the divide regard it as an assault on the country’s influential farming sector, led an ultimately unsuccessful push to sink it. Critics oppose it over concerns that their farmers would be undercut by a flow of cheaper goods, including meat, sugar, rice, honey and soybean, from agricultural giant Brazil and its neighbours.\n\nOn Tuesday, about 350 tractors entered Paris for a new day of farmers’ protests to demand “concrete and immediate actions” from the government which is struggling to face the agricultural anger. The event was however also marred by disinformation, as an AI-generated video of tractors in the capital – debunked by the German Press Agency dpa’s fact checking team – showed.\n\nFarmers drive their tractors down the Avenue des Champs-Elysées as they protest against the Mercosur trade agreement. Photo: Emma Da Silva/AP/dpa.\n\nFrench Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard argued that the approval by ambassadors of member States was “not the end of the story”, as the European Parliament had still to vote on the deal. She also highlighted that “the anger of farmers is deep and their demands are legitimate”.\n\nFarmers have also marched in Poland and Ireland, and blocked roads in Belgium and other countries while the EU gave the green light to the trade deal on Friday.\n\nEven after Friday’s vote, farmers in Belgium were still organising protests and roadblocks to voice their hostility towards the agreement. It became already clear at the end of last year, that Belgium had to abstain from voting because its various governments have not reached a consensus. The regional Walloon government opposed the trade deal, and there was no agreement among the coalition partners at the federal and Flemish levels.\n\nThe Flemish nationalist party N-VA of prime minister Bart De Wever was the most outspoken advocate of the agreement, but found too little support among political parties.\n\nAt protests in Warsaw on Friday, Polish farmers complained the deal could flood Polish and wider European markets with significantly cheaper food imports, threatening local producers.\n\nEarlier that day, conservative President Karol Nawrocki had met with farmers involved in organising the protest and had declared his willingness to collaborate with the agricultural community.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk said he shared the protesting farmers’ opposition to the landmark agreement. “We had been voting against the agreement on every stage, we did it even during the last vote,” he added.\n\nMinister of Agriculture Stefan Krajewski threatened to refer the EU-Mercosur trade deal to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nEven some EU-countries who voted in favour of the agreement have faced internal pressure.\n\nIn Slovenia, for instance, the president of the Slovenian Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry (KGZS), Jože Podgoršek, reiterated that the organisation, which represents national farmers, could not back the deal with Mercosur because it was damaging to European farmers.\n\nThe Agriculture Ministry responded to concerns raised by farmers by pledging to carefully monitor its implementation, and, in case of risks to Slovenian agriculture, demand action and use all available protective mechanisms.\n\nEU farmers come first\n\nThe crucial adjustment to convince Italy and obtain European approval occurred precisely in the area of safeguards: the threshold that triggers investigations on sensitive agricultural products in case of market disturbances has been reduced from 8 percent to 5 percent. This means that the European Commission remains ready to open an investigation whenever there is a 5 percent increase in import volumes or a 5 percent drop in import prices of concrete products – as in beef, poultry, rice, honey, eggs, garlic, ethanol or sugar.\n\nItaly’s go-ahead, emphasised Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, was made possible “thanks to the guarantees obtained for our farmers”, which now make the balance “sustainable”. The government could not have given the green light “at the expense of our excellent products”, Meloni said, reiterating that it had never had “an ideological exclusion”.\n\nRome was also reassured by the concessions obtained in recent weeks: a compensation fund of 6.3 billion Euro, increased plant health controls, the commitment not to increase fertilizer prices and the possibility of allocating an additional 45 billion Euro from the next EU budget to the CAP, the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy.\n\nMoreover, the agreement will protect over 340 traditional EU food products, recognised as geographical indications and add a cap on the quantity of products imported from Mercosur that benefit from lower tariffs for beef, pork and poultry.\n\nThese additional safeguards also convinced other countries like Romania.\n\nAccording to its President Nicușor Dan, Romania voted in favour of the trade agreement only after additional safeguards were negotiated alongside other EU member states to protect Romanian and European producers.\n\nIn fact, Romania’s position on the Mercosur agreement is highly polarised, split between support for its potential economic benefits – such as access to new markets and export opportunities – and concerns over its impact on domestic agriculture, environmental standards, and the competitiveness of Romanian producers. The latter describe it as a major threat to the viability of the country’s domestic agri-food sector.\n\nA similar situation can be seen in Slovakia, who also voted in favour. Agriculture Minister Richard Takáč, welcomed the safeguard mechanisms to guarantee a monthly basis of control and that the quality of the imported products would also be verified, so the EU is not at risk.\n\nBulgarian Agriculture and Food Minister Georgi Tahov said that “the costs of energy, fertilisers, feed, labour and services continue to rise, while market returns remain uncertain. This directly threatens the economic sustainability of farms, especially in countries like Bulgaria, where incomes are below the EU average”.\n\nTherefore, Bulgaria also supported the introduction of protective mechanisms in EU legislation to safeguard farmers’ interests and mitigate potential risks for the agricultural sector. In addition, Deputy Economy Minister Doncho Barbalov expressed the country’s intention to strengthen its presence in the Mercosur countries, in line with the upward trend of recent years.\n\nNow, the future of the EU-Mercosur agreement comes down to the member states and the European Parliament.\n\nThis article is an ENR Key Story.
