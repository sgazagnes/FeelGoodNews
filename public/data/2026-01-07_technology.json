      "summary": "A new chip-based quantum memory uses nanoprinted “light cages” to trap light inside atomic vapor, enabling fast, reliable storage of quantum information. The structures can be fabricated with extreme precision and filled with atoms in days instead of months. Multiple memories can operate side by side on a single chip, all performing nearly identically. The result is a powerful, scalable building block for future quantum communication and computing.",
      "content": "Storing quantum information is essential for the future of both quantum computing and a global quantum internet. Today's quantum communication systems struggle with signal loss over long distances, which limits how far quantum information can travel. Quantum memories help solve this problem by making quantum repeaters possible, allowing information to hop across a network through entanglement swapping rather than fading away.\n\nA new study published in Light: Science & Applications reports a major advance in this area. Researchers from the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, the Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology, and the University of Stuttgart have introduced a new type of quantum memory built from 3D-nanoprinted structures known as \"light cages\" filled with atomic vapor. By bringing both light and atoms together on a single chip, the team has created a platform designed for scalability and seamless integration into quantum photonic systems.\n\nWhat Makes Light Cages Different\n\nLight cages are hollow-core waveguides engineered to tightly guide light while still allowing access to the space inside. This design offers a key advantage over conventional hollow-core fibers, which can take months to fill with atomic vapor. In contrast, the open structure of light cages lets cesium atoms diffuse into the core much more quickly, cutting the filling process down to just a few days without sacrificing optical performance.\n\nThe structures are fabricated using two-photon polymerization lithography with commercial 3D printing systems. This approach allows researchers to directly print intricate hollow-core waveguides onto silicon chips with extremely high precision. To protect the devices from chemical reactions with cesium, the waveguides are coated with a protective layer. Tests showed no signs of degradation even after five years of operation, highlighting the system's long-term stability.\n\n\"We created a guiding structure that allows quick diffusion of gases and fluids inside its core, with the versatility and reproducibility provided by the 3D-nanoprinting process. This enables true scalability of this platform, not only for intra-chip fabrication of the waveguides but also inter-chip, for producing multiple chips with the same performance,\" explained the research team.\n\nTurning Light Into Stored Quantum Information\n\nInside the light cages, incoming light pulses are efficiently converted into collective excitations of the surrounding atoms. After a chosen storage time, a control laser reverses this process and releases the stored light exactly when needed. In a key demonstration, the researchers successfully stored very weak light pulses containing only a few photons for several hundred nanoseconds. They believe this approach can eventually be extended to store single photons for many milliseconds.\n\nAnother major milestone was the integration of multiple light cage memories on a single chip placed inside a cesium vapor cell. Measurements showed that different light cages with the same design delivered nearly identical storage performance across two separate devices on the same chip. This level of consistency is essential for building scalable quantum systems.\n\nThe strong reproducibility comes from the precision of the 3D-nanoprinting process. Variations within a single chip were kept below 2 nanometers, while differences between chips remained under 15 nanometers. Such tight control is critical for spatial multiplexing, a technique that could dramatically increase the number of quantum memories operating together on one device.\n\nImplications for Quantum Networks and Computing\n\nLight cage quantum memories address several long-standing challenges in quantum technology. In quantum repeater networks, they could synchronize multiple single photons at the same time, greatly boosting the efficiency of long-distance quantum communication. In photonic quantum computing, the memories provide controlled delays that are needed for feed-forward operations in measurement-based quantum computing systems.\n\nThe platform also stands out for its practicality. Unlike many competing technologies, it operates slightly above room temperature and does not require cryogenic cooling or complex atom-trapping setups. This makes the system easier to deploy while also offering higher bandwidth per memory mode. The ability to produce many identical quantum memories on a single chip opens a clear path toward large-scale quantum photonic integration.\n\nThanks to its flexible fabrication process, the technology can potentially be combined with direct fiber coupling and existing photonic components. These advantages position light cage quantum memories as a strong candidate for future quantum communication infrastructure.\n\nA Scalable Path Forward\n\nThe development of light cage quantum memories marks a significant step in quantum photonic research. By merging advanced 3D-nanoprinting with core principles of quantum optics, the researchers have created a compact, scalable system that could speed the arrival of practical quantum networks and more powerful quantum computers.",

      "summary": "Researchers have created microscopic robots so small they’re barely visible, yet smart enough to sense, decide, and move completely on their own. Powered by light and equipped with tiny computers, the robots swim by manipulating electric fields rather than using moving parts. They can detect temperature changes, follow programmed paths, and even work together in groups. The breakthrough marks the first truly autonomous robots at this microscopic scale.",
      "content": "Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan have built the smallest fully programmable autonomous robots ever created. These microscopic machines can swim through liquid, sense their surroundings, respond on their own, operate for months at a time, and cost about one penny each to produce.\n\nEach robot is barely visible without magnification, measuring roughly 200 by 300 by 50 micrometers. That makes them smaller than a grain of salt. Because they function at the same scale as many living microorganisms, the robots could one day help doctors monitor individual cells or assist engineers in assembling tiny devices used in advanced manufacturing.\n\nPowered entirely by light, the robots contain microscopic computers that allow them to follow programmed paths, detect local temperature changes, and adjust their movement in response.\n\nThe work was reported in Science Robotics and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Unlike previous tiny machines, these robots do not rely on wires, magnetic fields, or external controls. This makes them the first truly autonomous and programmable robots at such a small scale.\n\n\"We've made autonomous robots 10,000 times smaller,\" says Marc Miskin, Assistant Professor in Electrical and Systems Engineering at Penn Engineering and the papers' senior author. \"That opens up an entirely new scale for programmable robots.\"\n\nWhy shrinking robots has been so difficult\n\nElectronics have steadily become smaller over the past several decades, but robotics has not followed the same trajectory. According to Miskin, independence at sizes below one millimeter has remained an unsolved challenge. \"Building robots that operate independently at sizes below one millimeter is incredibly difficult,\" he says. \"The field has essentially been stuck on this problem for 40 years.\"\n\nAt everyday scales, motion is shaped by forces such as gravity and inertia, which depend on an object's volume. At microscopic sizes, however, surface-related forces dominate instead. Drag and viscosity become overwhelming, dramatically changing how movement works. \"If you're small enough, pushing on water is like pushing through tar,\" says Miskin.\n\nBecause of this shift in physics, conventional robotic designs fail. Small arms or legs tend to break easily and are extremely difficult to manufacture. \"Very tiny legs and arms are easy to break,\" Miskin explains. \"They're also very hard to build.\"\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the researchers developed a completely new way for robots to move that works with the physics of the microscopic world rather than fighting against it.\n\nHow microscopic robots swim\n\nFish and other large swimmers move by pushing water backward, generating forward motion through Newton's Third Law. The tiny robots take a very different approach.\n\nInstead of bending or flexing, the robots generate an electrical field that gently pushes charged particles in the surrounding liquid. As those ions move, they drag nearby water molecules with them, effectively creating motion in the fluid around the robot. \"It's as if the robot is in a moving river,\" says Miskin, \"but the robot is also causing the river to move.\"\n\nBy adjusting this electrical field, the robots can change direction, follow complex paths, and even coordinate their movement in groups that resemble schools of fish. They can reach speeds of up to one body length per second.\n\nBecause this swimming method uses electrodes with no moving parts, the robots are remarkably durable. According to Miskin, they can be transferred between samples repeatedly with a micropipette without damage. Powered by light from an LED, the robots are able to keep swimming for months.\n\nPacking intelligence into a microscopic body\n\nTrue autonomy requires more than movement. A robot must also be able to sense its environment, make decisions, and power itself. All of those components must fit onto a chip that is only a fraction of a millimeter across. This challenge was taken on by David Blaauw's team at the University of Michigan.\n\nBlaauw's lab already holds the record for creating the world's smallest computer. When Blaauw and Miskin met at a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) presentation five years ago, they quickly realized their technologies complemented each other. \"We saw that Penn Engineering's propulsion system and our tiny electronic computers were just made for each other,\" says Blaauw. Even so, turning that idea into a working robot required five years of development.\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles was power. \"The key challenge for the electronics,\" Blaauw says, \"is that the solar panels are tiny and produce only 75 nanowatts of power. That is over 100,000 times less power than what a smart watch consumes.\" To make the system work, the team designed specialized circuits that operate at extremely low voltages, cutting power consumption by more than 1000 times.\n\nSpace was another major constraint. The solar panels take up most of the robot's surface, leaving very little room for computing hardware. To solve this, the researchers redesigned how the robot's software works. \"We had to totally rethink the computer program instructions,\" Blaauw explains, \"condensing what conventionally would require many instructions for propulsion control into a single, special instruction to shrink the program's length to fit in the robot's tiny memory space.\"\n\nRobots that sense and communicate\n\nTogether, these advances produced what the researchers believe is the first sub-millimeter robot capable of real decision-making. To their knowledge, no one has previously placed a complete computer with a processor, memory, and sensors into a robot this small. That achievement allows the robots to sense their environment and respond independently.\n\nThe robots include electronic temperature sensors that can detect changes as small as one third of a degree Celsius. This capability allows them to move toward warmer regions or report temperature values that can serve as indicators of cellular activity, offering a way to monitor individual cells.\n\nCommunicating those measurements required an inventive solution. \"To report out their temperature measurements, we designed a special computer instruction that encodes a value, such as the measured temperature, in the wiggles of a little dance the robot performs,\" says Blaauw. \"We then look at this dance through a microscope with a camera and decode from the wiggles what the robots are saying to us. It's very similar to how honey bees communicate with each other.\"\n\nThe same light that powers the robots is also used to program them. Each robot has a unique address, allowing researchers to upload different instructions to different units. \"This opens up a host of possibilities,\" Blaauw adds, \"with each robot potentially performing a different role in a larger, joint task.\"\n\nA platform for future microscopic machines\n\nThe current robots are only the starting point. Future versions could carry more advanced programs, move faster, include additional sensors, or function in harsher environments. The researchers designed the system as a flexible platform, combining a robust propulsion method with electronics that can be manufactured cheaply and adapted over time.\n\n\"This is really just the first chapter,\" says Miskin. \"We've shown that you can put a brain, a sensor and a motor into something almost too small to see, and have it survive and work for months. Once you have that foundation, you can layer on all kinds of intelligence and functionality. It opens the door to a whole new future for robotics at the microscale.\"\n\nThe research was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) School of Engineering and Applied Science, Penn School of Arts & Sciences, and the University of Michigan Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Speaking at the annual CES technology conference in Las Vegas, boss Jensen Huan said the system - called Alpamayo - would bring \"reasoning\" to autonomous vehicles. That would allow cars to \"think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,\" Huang claimed. He said Nvidia was working with Mercedes to produce a driverless car powered by the tech, which would be released in the US in the coming months before being rolled out in Europe and Asia.\n\nNvidia's chips have helped power the AI revolution, though so far attention has mostly been focussed on the software it powers, such as ChatGPT. However, leading tech firms are now increasingly looking for hardware - meaning physical products such as cars - that AI could be used in.\n\nPhysical AI's 'ChatGPT moment'\n\nWearing his trademark black leather jacket, Huang told an audience of hundreds that the project has taught Nvidia \"an enormous amount\" about how to help partners build robotic systems. \"The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is almost here,\" Huang said. \"NVIDIA's pivot toward AI at scale and AI systems as differentiators will help keep it way ahead of rivals,\" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, from Las Vegas. \"Alpamayo represents a profound shift for NVIDIA, moving from being primarily a compute to a platform provider for physical AI ecosystems.\" Shares of the AI chip designer rose slightly in after-hours trading following Huang's presentation. It featured a video demonstration of the AI-powered Mercedes-Benz driving through San Francisco while a passenger, sat behind the steering wheel, kept their hands in their lap. \"It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,\" Huang said, \"but in every single scenario... it tells you what it's going to do, and it reasons about what it's about to do.\" Alpamayo is an open-source AI model, with the underlying code now available on machine learning platform Hugging Face, where autonomous vehicle researchers can access it for free and retrain the model, Huang said. \"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" he told the audience. The project could pose a threat to companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, which offers driver assistance software called Autopilot. \"Well that's just exactly what Tesla is doing,\" Musk posted on social media following the Alpamayo announcement. \"What they will find is that it's easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.\" Like Tesla, Nvidia also has plans to launch a robotaxi service by next year in collaboration with a partner, but has declined to name the partner or say where it will be.\n\nNvidia is the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of more than $4.5tn (£3.3tn). It became the first company to reach $5tn in October, but has lost value over concerns about whether demand AI is overhyped.",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 06 January 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03984-8A ‘photonic skin’ with controllable colour and texture brings materials science a step closer to the adaptive camouflage found in nature.",
      "content": "When an octopus changes its appearance, the transformation is instant and spectacular. Chromatophore pigment cells expand to alter the hue and brightness of the animal’s skin and muscle-controlled protrusions called papillae raise or flatten the surface to change its texture1. This dual, independent control over colour and texture creates one of the most sophisticated camouflage systems in the natural world. Writing in Nature, Doshi et al.2 report an artificial ‘photonic skin’ that performs a similar trick. Their soft polymer film can independently change both its colour and its surface topography, a feat that nature perfected long ago but has remained elusive in synthetic materials.\n\nNature 649, 297-298 (2026)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03984-8\n\nReferences Hanlon, R.

      "personality_title": "New artificial skin changes color and texture like an octopus",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Octopuses can quickly change their skin color and texture to blend into their surroundings. They do this using special cells that control color and muscle movements that change the skin's surface. This natural ability is one of the most advanced types of camouflage in the animal world.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists led by Doshi created a soft, artificial material called 'photonic skin' that can change both its color and surface texture separately, just like an octopus does. This new skin is made from a special kind of plastic film that reacts to different signals to change how it looks and feels.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time a man-made material has been able to control color and texture independently in this way. It could lead to new technologies in areas like military camouflage, robots that adapt to their environment, or clothes that change appearance. This breakthrough brings science closer to copying nature’s clever tricks.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will work on improving the durability and responsiveness of this photonic skin. They will also explore how to use it in real products, such as flexible wearable devices or smart surfaces that can change on demand.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have developed an artificial skin that mimics an octopus’s ability to change color and texture independently, opening new possibilities for adaptive materials.",
