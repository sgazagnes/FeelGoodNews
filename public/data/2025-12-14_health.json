      "summary": "Researchers used AI to pinpoint a little-known monkeypox protein that provokes strong protective antibodies. When the team tested this protein as a vaccine ingredient in mice, it produced a potent immune response. The discovery could lead to simpler, more effective mpox vaccines and therapies. It may also help guide future efforts against smallpox.",
      "content": "With support from artificial intelligence, an international group of scientists has taken an important early step toward creating more effective defenses against the monkeypox virus (MPXV). This virus can cause intense pain and, in severe cases, death, with the greatest risk to children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems. In a study published in Science Translational Medicine, the researchers reported that mice produced strong neutralizing antibodies after receiving a viral surface protein identified through AI analysis. The result suggests a promising direction for future mpox vaccines or antibody treatments.\n\nDuring 2022, mpox spread across many countries and sickened more than 150,000 people. The illness caused flulike symptoms along with rashes and lesions, and nearly 500 people died. Health officials relied on smallpox vaccines to protect those most vulnerable, but these vaccines are costly and difficult to manufacture because they use a whole, weakened virus.\n\n\"Unlike a whole-virus vaccine that's big and complicated to produce, our innovation is just a single protein that's easy to make,\" said Jason McLellan, a professor of molecular biosciences at The University of Texas at Austin and co-lead author of the study.\n\nIdentifying Powerful Antibodies From Patients\n\nThe study's other lead authors, Rino Rappuoli and Emanuele Andreano at the Fondazione Biotecnopolo di Siena in Italy, identified 12 antibodies that neutralize MPXV. They found these antibodies by analyzing blood from people who had recovered from the virus or who had previously been vaccinated. Although the antibodies were clear, the team did not yet know which parts of the virus they targeted.\n\nMPXV displays many different proteins on its surface, and at least one of them is essential for spreading infection. Some of the newly discovered antibodies were known to interfere with this process, but researchers did not know which surface protein was responsible. To design new treatments or vaccines, they needed to determine the correct pairing between antibody and viral protein. This key viral feature is known as an antigen.\n\nAI Pinpoints a Previously Overlooked Viral Protein\n\nTo solve this puzzle, McLellan's group used the AlphaFold 3 model to predict which of the roughly 35 viral surface proteins were likely to bind strongly to the patient-derived antibodies. The model identified a protein called OPG153 with high confidence, and laboratory tests confirmed the prediction. This finding indicated that OPG153 could serve as a valuable target for developing antibody-based therapies or for designing a new type of vaccine that activates the immune system to fight mpox.\n\n\"It would have taken years to find this target without AI,\" said McLellan, who also holds the Robert A. Welch Chair in Chemistry and helps lead Texas Biologics, a UT Austin research group focused on therapeutic innovation. \"It was really exciting because no one had ever considered it before for vaccine or antibody development. It had never been shown to be a target of neutralizing antibodies.\"\n\nBecause MPXV is closely related to the virus responsible for smallpox, this discovery may support the creation of improved vaccines or treatments for smallpox as well, a disease of concern due to its ease of transmission and high mortality rate.\n\nToward Next-Generation Vaccines and Antibody Therapies\n\nThe team is now refining versions of the antigen and antibodies that could be more effective, less expensive and easier to manufacture compared with current options that rely on weakened poxviruses. Their long-term goal is to test these mpox and smallpox vaccine antigens and antibody treatments in humans. McLellan refers to their strategy as \"reverse vaccinology.\"\n\n\"We started with people who survived infection with monkeypox virus, isolated antibodies that they naturally produced and worked backward to find what part of the virus acted as the antigen for those antibodies. Then we engineered the antigen to elicit similar antibodies in mice,\" McLellan said.\n\nUT Austin has filed a patent application for the use of OPG153 (and its derivatives) as a vaccine antigen. The Fondazione Biotecnopolo di Siena has filed a patent application for antibodies that target OPG153.\n\nAdditional UT Austin contributors include Emily Rundlet, Ling Zhou and Connor Mullins.\n\nFunding support for this work came in part from the Welch Foundation.",

      "title": "New discovery offers real hope for rare genetic disease",
      "summary": "Scientists discovered that certain gene changes allow cells to function even when frataxin, the protein lost in Friedreich’s ataxia, is missing. Experiments in worms, human cells, and mice revealed that lowering a gene called FDX2 helps restore vital energy processes. The work points to a new, more targeted treatment strategy.",
      "content": "Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an uncommon but very serious inherited condition. Symptoms usually appear in childhood or early adolescence, often between ages 5 and 15, and many affected individuals live only into their 30s or 40s. There is currently no broadly approved therapy that slows or alters the disease itself, and available treatments may not work for everyone. Scientists from Mass General Brigham and the Broad Institute are exploring new therapeutic approaches and have identified a genetic modifier that could point toward a future treatment strategy. Their results appear in Nature.\n\nTo investigate why FA develops and how it might be treated, researchers rely on small but powerful model organisms. The disease is caused by the loss of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein needed for the production of iron sulfur clusters, which help cells carry out essential energy-related tasks. Earlier work from the Mootha lab showed that exposing human cells, worms, and mice to low oxygen (hypoxia) can partly offset the effects of missing frataxin.\n\n\"In this paper, instead of trying to pursue hypoxia to slow or postpone the disease as a therapy, we simply used it as a trick. We used it as a laboratory tool with which to discover genetic suppressors,\" said lead and co-corresponding author Joshua Meisel, a former postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), part of Mass General Brigham. Meisel, now an assistant professor at Brandeis University, added, \"The reason this is exciting is because the suppressor that we've identified, FDX2, is now a protein that can be targeted using more conventional medicines.\"\n\nUsing Worm Models to Reveal Hidden Genetic Interactions\n\nThe team, which included Nobel laureate Gary Ruvkun, PhD, studied a tiny roundworm species called C. elegans to understand how cells might function without frataxin. They engineered worms that completely lacked the protein and kept them alive by growing them in low-oxygen environments. This allowed the researchers to test genetic changes one by one and search for rare worms that could survive even when oxygen levels were increased (a normally deadly condition for worms without frataxin).\n\nBy sequencing the genomes of the worms that survived these higher oxygen levels, the researchers uncovered mutations in two mitochondrial genes: FDX2 and NFS1. They then verified these findings through advanced genetic engineering, biochemical experiments, and follow-up studies in mouse and human cells to assess whether the same compensation might occur in more complex organisms.\n\nA New Understanding of How Cells Compensate for Frataxin Loss\n\nThe results showed that certain mutations in FDX2 and NFS1 allow cells to work around the absence of frataxin by restoring their ability to make iron sulfur clusters. These clusters are crucial for producing cellular energy and supporting many metabolic functions. The team also discovered that excessive levels of FDX2 interfere with this process, while reducing FDX2, either through mutation or by removing one copy of the gene, helps restore cluster production and improves cell health.\n\n\"The balance between frataxin and FDX2 is key,\" said senior and co-corresponding author Vamsi Mootha, MD, of the Department of Molecular Biology and Center for Genome Medicine at MGH. Mootha, also an institute member and co-director of the Metabolism Program at Broad, explained, \"When you are born with too little frataxin, bringing down FDX2 a bit helps. So, it's a delicate balancing act to ensure proper biochemical homeostasis.\"\n\nTherapeutic Potential and Remaining Questions\n\nLowering FDX2 levels in a mouse model of FA led to meaningful improvements in neurological symptoms, suggesting that this approach could form the basis for a future therapy. Overall, the findings indicate that carefully adjusting proteins that interact genetically with frataxin may help counteract the damage caused by frataxin loss.\n\nAlthough these discoveries are encouraging, the researchers caution that the ideal balance between frataxin and FDX2 likely varies among tissues and conditions. Additional research will be needed to understand how this balance is controlled in people. Future pre-clinical studies will also be required to determine whether modifying FDX2 levels is both safe and effective before any potential human trials could be considered.\n\nStudy Team, Patents, and Funding\n\nIn addition to Meisel, Mootha, and Ruvkun, authors include Pallavi R. Joshi, Amy N. Spelbring, Hong Wang, Sandra M. Wellner, Presli P. Wiesenthal, Maria Miranda, Jason G. McCoy, and David P. Barondeau.\n\nMootha is listed as an inventor on patents filed by MGH involving therapeutic uses of hypoxia. Meisel, Ruvkun, and Mootha are inventors on a patent filed by MGH related to the technology described in this work; Meisel, Ruvkun, and Mootha own equity in and receive compensation from Falcon Bio, a company developing this technology. Mootha also serves as a paid advisor to 5am Ventures.\n\nThis research was supported by the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, the National Institutes of Health (R00GM140217, R01NS124679, R01AG016636, and R01GM096100), and the Robert A.

      "content": "In a recent Genomic Press Interview published in Brain Medicine, Dr. Eric J. Nestler reflects on how an early fascination with brain chemistry helped shape a worldwide transformation in psychiatric research. As the Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, he describes nearly four decades spent unraveling the molecular processes that explain why drugs and stress influence human behavior. What started as an effort to study basic protein signaling in the laboratory of Nobel laureate Paul Greengard eventually grew into a broad understanding of how life experiences can alter the brain's genetic activity over time.\n\nDr. Nestler traces his interest in science back to an unusual home laboratory in the basement of his family's house in Nassau County, Long Island. Guided by his father, a high school biology teacher in the New York City public school system, he learned how to design and carry out experiments. These projects later became award-winning science fair entries and set the stage for an academic path through Yale University, where he earned BA, PhD, and MD degrees while training under Dr. Greengard.\n\nBuilding a New Field in Molecular Psychiatry\n\nHis decision to name his research group at Yale Medical School \"The Laboratory of Molecular Psychiatry\" turned out to be remarkably forward-thinking. At a time when applying molecular biology to psychiatric questions was still considered bold, Dr. Nestler and colleague Dr. Ron Duman recognized that the field was ready for a new scientific direction. The name reflected genuine ambition. Within a few years, he was appointed Founding Director of the Division of Molecular Psychiatry at Yale, a role made possible when the sitting Director, Dr. George Heninger, voluntarily stepped aside. Dr. Nestler often recalls this moment as an example of generosity that he has tried to extend to younger scientists throughout his career.\n\nBreakthrough Insights Into Brain Adaptation\n\nOne of the most influential discoveries associated with his work involves the transcription factor ΔFosB. This protein accumulates in the brain's reward circuits during prolonged drug exposure and sustained stress, altering patterns of gene expression in affected neurons. While most proteins break down quickly, ΔFosB remains active for weeks or months. This unusually long lifespan provides a biological explanation for how relatively brief experiences can produce long-lasting changes in mood, motivation, and behavior. Researchers around the world now view ΔFosB as a key contributor to vulnerability to addiction.\n\nThe interview highlights the type of forward-looking scientific dialogue that characterizes Genomic Press's open-access publications, which make cutting-edge findings accessible to researchers globally. The organization's commitment to broad, barrier-free dissemination has helped accelerate progress across multiple branches of medical science.\n\nFrom Signaling Pathways to Single-Cell Biology\n\nOver roughly forty years, the direction of this research has shifted in notable ways. Early work focused on intracellular signaling cascades, then expanded into the study of transcription factors and gene networks that shape behavior in specific parts of the brain. Approximately twenty years ago, Dr. Nestler's team began exploring epigenetic regulation, the chromatin modifications that allow environmental conditions to produce lasting changes in brain function. Improvements in scientific tools have since enabled increasingly detailed studies: first at the level of whole brain regions, then individual cell types, and now single-cell analyses that reveal subtle differences unseen in earlier studies. These advances raise an important question: could these insights eventually lead to personalized treatments tailored to select neuron populations within a single patient?\n\nResilience as a New Direction in Mental Health Science\n\nA defining aspect of this research program is the emphasis on resilience rather than solely on pathology. His laboratory identified specific molecular, cellular, and circuit-level signatures in animals that maintain normal behavior despite exposure to stress or drugs. These animals show natural protective features that are absent in more susceptible individuals. The idea that some brains possess built-in defenses has far-reaching implications, suggesting new ways to develop treatments that strengthen resilience instead of only repairing damage.\n\n\"In addition to seeking ways to reverse the deleterious effects of drug or stress exposure, it is possible to develop treatments that promote mechanisms of natural resilience in individuals who are inherently more susceptible,\" Dr. Nestler explains in the interview. Several of these resilience-based approaches are now in clinical testing for depression, offering one of the clearest examples of basic research informing new therapeutic possibilities. The potential success of these treatments prompts important questions about how psychiatric care may evolve in the coming decade.\n\nCross-Species Evidence and the Need to Protect Scientific Integrity\n\nKey discoveries from animal research have been supported by findings in postmortem human brain tissue from individuals with addiction and stress disorders, providing strong evidence that the principles uncovered in the laboratory translate to humans. Dr. Nestler's publication record includes more than 800 papers and major textbooks on the neurobiology of mental illness and molecular neuropharmacology. His work has been cited more than 177,000 times, and his h-index of 210 places him among the most influential scientists worldwide.\n\nWhen asked about his greatest concern for the future of science, he offers a clear warning: \"My greatest fear is that science becomes politicized, whereas science must never be political. People in blue and red states get the same illnesses.\" His message emphasizes the need to safeguard scientific independence at a time when political pressures threaten evidence-based research in many regions. The mission of Genomic Press to advance open-access medical science aligns strongly with this vision of science serving people everywhere.\n\nA Life Shaped by Family, Mentorship, and Service\n\nOutside of his research, Dr. Nestler values time spent with his wife Susan of 45 years, their three children David, Matt, and Jane, their spouses, and their five grandchildren, who range in age from eighteen months to four years. He describes his defining traits as hard work and generosity and considers organization and discipline to be his strongest skills. He also shares a desire to cultivate more patience and to become more willing to challenge unkind behavior.\n\nWhen asked what brings him the most pride, he points not to the major honors he has received, including the Julius Axelrod Prize for Mentorship, the Gold Medal Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry, election to the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine, and honorary doctorates from Uppsala University and Concordia University. Instead, he cites the achievements of his former students and postdoctoral fellows. Additional information about Dr. Nestler and other leaders in science can be found on the Genomic Press website: https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/.\n\nHis guiding philosophy comes from Theodore Roosevelt, who wrote that credit belongs to \"the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.\" For nearly four decades, Dr. Nestler has remained in that arena, contributing discoveries that continue to shape how the world understands the brain and its response to adversity.",

      "summary": "Researchers discovered that children who went back to school during COVID experienced far fewer mental health diagnoses than those who stayed remote. Anxiety, depression, and ADHD all declined as in-person learning resumed. Healthcare spending tied to these conditions also dropped. Girls showed the largest improvements, highlighting the importance of school-based structure and support.",
      "content": "Key Points\n\nChildren who returned to in-person school during the COVID-19 pandemic were much less likely to receive mental health diagnoses than children whose schools stayed closed. Reductions were seen in anxiety, depression, and ADHD, and girls experienced the greatest improvements.\n\nMental health care spending fell notably after schools reopened, reaching an 11 percent decrease by the ninth month.\n\nThis research represents one of the largest and most comprehensive analyses to date on how pandemic school closures affected children's mental health.\n\nSchool Reopening During COVID Linked to Better Mental Health for Children\n\nA new study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and collaborating institutions reports that children experienced far fewer mental health diagnoses when their schools reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reductions were seen across conditions such as anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Health care spending connected to these diagnoses also declined, and girls showed the strongest improvements.\n\nThe study was published on Dec. 8, 2025, in Epidemiology.\n\n\"Our results provide solid evidence to parents, educators, and policymakers that in-person school plays a crucial role in kids' well-being,\" said senior author Rita Hamad, professor of social epidemiology and public policy. \"The findings offer lessons for future public health emergencies and provide insight into why mental health worsened for children during the pandemic.\"\n\nBackground on Youth Mental Health During the Pandemic\n\nEarlier research consistently showed that children and teens struggled emotionally during COVID-19. Some studies suggested that returning to classrooms offered important support, but many of those investigations relied on small samples or self-reported experiences rather than comprehensive data.\n\nTo produce a more detailed picture, the research team examined health diagnoses and spending information for 185,735 children between the ages of five and 18 years from March 2020 through June 2021. The dataset indicated whether a child received mental health treatment or filled a prescription related to anxiety, depression, or ADHD. Participants lived in 24 counties and 224 school districts across California, a state where school closures lasted longer than in most of the country and reopening timelines varied widely. These differences created a natural opportunity to compare outcomes. Data came from the Healthcare Integrated Research Database, which includes individual-level commercial insurance claims, along with school-level administrative data from the California Department of Education.\n\nLarge Reductions in Diagnoses and Spending After Reopening\n\nThe study documented an overall rise in mental health diagnoses during the pandemic, increasing from 2.8% to 3.5%. However, children who returned to in-person school were substantially less likely to receive new diagnoses than peers whose schools stayed closed. By the ninth month after reopening, the chance of being diagnosed with a mental health condition had dropped by 43% compared with the period before reopening. This trend included fewer cases of anxiety, depression, and ADHD.\n\nHealth care spending reflected a similar pattern. Nine months after schools reopened, non-drug medical spending related to mental health was 11% lower, spending on psychiatric medications was 8% lower, and spending on ADHD-specific medications was 5% lower. Girls saw greater improvements than boys over the same period.\n\nHow School Closures May Have Affected Children\n\nThe research team outlined several possible reasons for the mental health challenges children experienced while schools were closed. These included limited social interaction, disrupted sleep routines, more screen time, poorer dietary patterns, academic struggles, family stress linked to economic hardship or increased time at home, and reduced access to school-based mental health services.\n\n\"As we consider future public health emergencies, this study suggests we need to prioritize safe school reopenings and ensure children have access to the social and emotional resources that schools provide,\" Hamad said. \"Policies should focus not only on infection control, but also on the mental wellbeing of children, recognizing that schools are a critical part of their support system.\"\n\nStudy Limitations and Future Directions\n\nThe authors noted that the study focused on children living in relatively higher-income areas in California who were enrolled in commercial insurance plans, meaning they generally had better access to health care. More research is needed to explore how school reopening influenced children in marginalized communities, where the impact may have been even more significant.\n\nThe study received funding from the National Institutes of Health (grant U01MH129968).",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools closed to stop the spread of the virus. This led to children learning from home instead of attending school in person. Researchers wanted to understand how these closures affected kids’ mental health.\n\n**What happened**\nA study by Harvard and other institutions looked at health records of over 185,000 children in California from March 2020 to June 2021. They compared kids who returned to in-person school with those who stayed remote. The study found that children who went back to school had fewer new diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Girls showed the biggest improvements. Healthcare costs related to these mental health issues also dropped after schools reopened.\n\n**Impact**\nThis research is one of the largest to show that going back to school helped improve children’s mental health during the pandemic. It highlights how important school is not just for learning, but also for emotional support, social interaction, and access to mental health services. The decrease in healthcare spending shows the positive effect on families and the health system.\n\n**What's next step**\nResearchers suggest that during future health emergencies, it is important to reopen schools safely and quickly to support children’s mental well-being. More studies are needed to see how these findings apply to children in less wealthy communities or those with less access to healthcare.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nReturning to in-person school during the COVID-19 pandemic helped reduce mental health problems and related healthcare costs in children, especially girls.\n",
