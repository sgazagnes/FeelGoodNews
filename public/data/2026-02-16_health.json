      "summary": "Researchers tracked more than 400 toddlers to see whether mRNA COVID-19 vaccination during or just before pregnancy was linked to autism or developmental delays. After detailed assessments of speech, motor skills, behavior, and social development, they found no meaningful differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Experts say the results provide strong reassurance about vaccine safety in pregnancy.",
      "content": "Receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine shortly before or at any point during pregnancy is not linked to autism or other developmental disorders in children, according to research presented at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) 2026 Pregnancy Meeting. The findings provide new data on the long term health of children whose mothers were vaccinated around the time of pregnancy.\n\nIn the United States, two types of COVID-19 vaccines are recommended: the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine and a protein subunit vaccine. Both are considered safe during all stages of pregnancy and are recommended to help safeguard both maternal and infant health.\n\nStudy of 434 Toddlers\n\nThe investigation was conducted by researchers within the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network. The team evaluated 434 children between 18 months and 30 months of age for signs of autism and other developmental concerns.\n\nThe study was prospective, multi-center, and observational, and took place between May 2024 and March 2025. Half of the children (217) were born to mothers who received at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine either during pregnancy or within 30 days before becoming pregnant. The remaining 217 children were born to mothers who did not receive an mRNA vaccine during or within 30 days prior to pregnancy.\n\n\"Neurodevelopment outcomes in children born to mothers who received the COVID-19 vaccine during or shortly before pregnancy did not differ from those born to mothers who did not receive the vaccine,\" said senior researcher George R. Saade, MD, Professor and Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Associate Dean for Women's Health, at Macon & Joan Brock Virginia Health Sciences at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA.\n\nHow Researchers Compared Developmental Outcomes\n\nTo make the comparison as accurate as possible, vaccinated mothers were paired with unvaccinated mothers based on where they delivered (hospital, birth center, etc.), the date of delivery, insurance status, and race. Certain pregnancies were excluded from both groups, including those that ended before 37 weeks, involved multiple babies, or resulted in a child with a major congenital malformation.\n\nWhen the children reached 1 ½ -- 2 ½ years of age, researchers assessed their development using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire Version 3. This screening tool measures progress in five areas: communication, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, problem solving, and personal social interaction. The team also reviewed results from the Child Behavior Checklist, Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, and the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire to further evaluate behavioral and developmental patterns.\n\n\"This study, conducted through a rigorous scientific process in an NIH clinical trials network, demonstrates reassuring findings regarding the long-term health of children whose mothers received COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,\" said Brenna L. Hughes, MD, MSc, Edwin Crowell Hamblen Distinguished Professor of Reproductive Biology and Family Planning and Interim Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Duke University in Raleigh, NC.\n\nFunding and Disclosure\n\nThe study was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The authors noted that the conclusions presented are their own and do not necessarily reflect the official views of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nOral abstract #8 \"Association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in pregnancy and child neurodevelopment at 18-30 months\" will be published in the February 2026 issue of PREGNANCY, the official peer-reviewed medical journal of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.",

Using a powerful new AI-based system called SIGNET, the team uncovered cause-and-effect relationships between genes across six major brain cell types, revealing which genes are truly driving harmful changes. The most dramatic disruptions were found in excitatory neurons, where thousands of genetic interactions appear to be extensively rewired as the disease progresses.",
      "content": "A team led by Min Zhang and Dabao Zhang at the University of California, Irvine's Joe C. Wen School of Population & Public Health has developed the most comprehensive maps yet of how genes directly influence one another in brain cells affected by Alzheimer's disease. These maps go beyond identifying gene links. They reveal which genes are actively controlling others across different cell types in the brain.\n\nTo accomplish this, the researchers created a machine learning platform called SIGNET. Unlike traditional tools that only detect genes that appear to move together, SIGNET is designed to uncover true cause-and-effect relationships. Using this approach, the team identified important biological pathways that may contribute to memory loss and the gradual breakdown of brain tissue.\n\nThe findings were published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. The study also highlights newly identified genes that could become promising targets for future treatments. Funding support came in part from the National Institute on Aging and the National Cancer Institute.\n\nWhy Understanding Gene Control Matters in Alzheimer's\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and is expected to affect nearly 14 million Americans by 2060. Although scientists have linked several genes to the disease, including APOE and APP, they still do not fully understand how these genes interfere with normal brain function.\n\n\"Different types of brain cells play distinct roles in Alzheimer's disease, but how they interact at the molecular level has remained unclear,\" said Min Zhang, co-corresponding author and professor of epidemiology and biostatistics. \"Our work provides cell type-specific maps of gene regulation in the Alzheimer's brain, shifting the field from observing correlations to uncovering the causal mechanisms that actively drive disease progression.\"\n\nHow SIGNET Reveals Cause and Effect Between Genes\n\nTo build these detailed maps, the team analyzed single-cell molecular data from brain samples donated by 272 participants enrolled in long-term aging studies known as the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. SIGNET was designed as a scalable, high-performance computing system that combines single-cell RNA sequencing with whole-genome sequencing data. This integration allowed the researchers to detect cause-and-effect relationships among genes across the entire genome.\n\nUsing this method, they constructed causal gene regulatory networks for six major brain cell types. This made it possible to determine which genes are likely directing the activity of others, something conventional correlation-based methods cannot reliably accomplish.\n\n\"Most gene-mapping tools can show which genes move together, but they can't tell which genes are actually driving the changes,\" said Dabao Zhang, co-corresponding author and professor of epidemiology and biostatistics. \"Some methods also make unrealistic assumptions, such as ignoring feedback loops between genes. Our approach takes advantage of information encoded in DNA to enable the identification of true cause-and-effect relationships between genes in the brain.\"\n\nMajor Genetic Rewiring in Excitatory Neurons\n\nThe researchers found that the most significant gene disruptions occur in excitatory neurons -- the nerve cells that send activating signals -- where nearly 6,000 cause-and-effect interactions revealed extensive genetic rewiring as Alzheimer's progresses.\n\nThe team also identified hundreds of \"hub genes\" that function as central regulators, influencing many other genes and likely playing an important role in harmful changes in the brain. These hub genes could become valuable targets for earlier diagnosis and future therapies. The study further uncovered new regulatory roles for well-known genes such as APP, which was shown to strongly control other genes in inhibitory neurons.\n\nTo strengthen their conclusions, the researchers validated their findings using an independent set of human brain samples. This additional confirmation increases confidence that the observed gene relationships reflect genuine biological mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease.\n\nBeyond Alzheimer's, SIGNET may also be applied to the study of other complex diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders and mental health conditions.",

      "summary": "Sleeping on a problem might be more powerful than we ever imagined. Neuroscientists at Northwestern University have shown that dreams can actually be nudged in specific directions — and those dream tweaks may boost creativity. By playing subtle sound cues during REM sleep, researchers prompted people to dream about unsolved brain teasers they had struggled with earlier. An astonishing 75% of participants dreamed about the cued puzzles, and those puzzles were solved far more often the next day.",
      "content": "Most people have heard the advice to \"sleep on it\" when faced with a tough decision. New research suggests that guidance may be grounded in science. While many people report breakthrough ideas emerging from dreams, researchers have struggled to test this phenomenon because dreams are difficult to control in a lab setting.\n\nA new study from neuroscientists at Northwestern University shows that it is possible to influence what people dream about. The findings support the idea that REM sleep, the rapid eye movement stage of sleep when vivid and sometimes lucid dreams occur, may be especially helpful for creative problem solving.\n\nUsing Sound Cues to Shape Dreams\n\nThe researchers used a technique called targeted memory reactivation (TMR). During sleep, they played sounds that reminded participants of earlier attempts to solve specific puzzles. These audio cues were delivered only after brain monitoring confirmed that participants were asleep.\n\nAs a result, 75% of participants reported dreams that included elements or ideas related to the unsolved puzzles. Puzzles that appeared in dreams were solved at a much higher rate than those that did not. Participants solved 42% of the dream-related puzzles compared to 17% of the others.\n\nEven so, the results do not prove that dreaming directly causes better solutions. Other factors, such as heightened curiosity about certain puzzles, could have influenced both dreaming and performance. Still, successfully guiding dream content marks an important advance in understanding how sleep may support creative thinking.\n\n\"Many problems in the world today require creative solutions. By learning more about how our brains are able to think creatively, think anew and generate creative new ideas, we could be closer to solving the problems we want to solve, and sleep engineering could help,\" said senior author Ken Paller, the James Padilla Professor of Psychology and director of the cognitive neuroscience program in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern.\n\nInside the REM Sleep Experiment\n\nThe study included 20 participants who had prior experience with lucid dreaming, meaning they sometimes realized they were dreaming while still asleep. In the lab, each person attempted to solve a series of brain teaser puzzles, with three minutes allotted per puzzle. Each puzzle was paired with its own distinctive soundtrack. Most puzzles remained unsolved due to their difficulty.\n\nParticipants then spent the night in the lab while researchers recorded their brain activity and other physiological signals using polysomnography. During REM sleep, scientists replayed the soundtracks linked to half of the unsolved puzzles to selectively reactivate those memories.\n\nSome participants used prearranged signals, such as specific in and out sniffing patterns, to indicate that they heard the sounds and were actively working on the puzzles within their dreams.\n\nThe next morning, participants described their dreams. Many reported imagery or ideas connected to the puzzles. In 12 out of 20 participants, dreams referred more often to the puzzles associated with sound cues than to uncued puzzles. These same participants were more likely to solve the reactivated puzzles after waking, improving their success rate from 20% to 40% -- which was significant.\n\nDreams Respond Even Without Lucidity\n\nKaren Konkoly, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in Paller's Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, said one of the biggest surprises was how strongly the cues influenced dreams even when participants were not lucid.\n\n\"Even without lucidity, one dreamer asked a dream character for help solving the puzzle we were cueing. Another was cued with the 'trees' puzzle and woke up dreaming of walking through a forest. Another dreamer was cued with a puzzle about jungles and woke up from a dream in which she was fishing in the jungle thinking about that puzzle,\" Konkoly said.\n\n\"These were fascinating examples to witness because they showed how dreamers can follow instructions, and dreams can be influenced by sounds during sleep, even without lucidity.\"\n\nWhat This Means for Creativity and Mental Health\n\nThe team plans to use targeted memory reactivation and interactive dreaming methods to explore other possible roles of dreaming, including emotional regulation and broader learning processes.\n\n\"My hope is that these findings will help move us towards stronger conclusions about the functions of dreaming,\" Konkoly said. \"If scientists can definitively say that dreams are important for problem solving, creativity and emotion regulation, hopefully people will start to take dreams seriously as a priority for mental health and well-being.\"\n\nThe study, \"Creative problem-solving after experimentally provoking dreams of unsolved puzzles during REM sleep\" was published in the journal Neuroscience of Consciousness on Feb. 5.\n\nNorthwestern co-authors include Daniel Morris, Kaitlyn Hurka, Alysiana Martinez and Kristin Sanders.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – People often say to \"sleep on it\" when facing a hard problem, but scientists have struggled to prove how dreams might help. Dreams happen mostly during REM sleep, a stage when our eyes move quickly and dreams can be vivid.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Northwestern University played soft sounds during REM sleep that reminded 20 people of puzzles they tried to solve before sleeping. These sounds guided 75% of participants to dream about those puzzles. The next day, people solved those dream-related puzzles more than twice as often as others.\n\n**Impact** – This study shows that it is possible to influence dreams in a way that helps with creative thinking. While it does not prove dreams alone solve problems, it suggests sleep and dreaming play an important role in how our brain works on challenges. This finding opens up new ways to understand creativity and learning.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to explore how dream guidance might help with emotions and other learning tasks. They hope this work will encourage people to value dreams as part of mental health and creativity.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Playing sounds during REM sleep can steer dreams toward unsolved puzzles, helping people find creative solutions after waking.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – On dit souvent de \"dormir dessus\" quand on a un problème difficile, mais les scientifiques avaient du mal à prouver comment les rêves pouvaient aider. Les rêves surviennent surtout pendant le sommeil paradoxal (REM), une phase où les yeux bougent rapidement et les rêves sont vifs.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Des chercheurs de l'université Northwestern ont joué des sons doux pendant le sommeil REM qui rappelaient à 20 personnes des énigmes qu'elles avaient essayé de résoudre avant de dormir. Ces sons ont guidé 75 % des participants à rêver de ces énigmes. Le lendemain, les participants ont résolu ces énigmes liées aux rêves plus de deux fois plus souvent que les autres.\n\n**Impact** – Cette étude montre qu'il est possible d'influencer les rêves pour aider à la pensée créative. Même si cela ne prouve pas que les rêves seuls résolvent les problèmes, cela suggère que le sommeil et les rêves jouent un rôle important dans le travail du cerveau sur les défis. Cette découverte ouvre de nouvelles voies pour comprendre la créativité et l'apprentissage.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques veulent explorer comment guider les rêves peut aider à gérer les émotions et d'autres apprentissages. Ils espèrent que ce travail encouragera les gens à considérer les rêves comme une part importante de la santé mentale et de la créativité.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Jouer des sons pendant le sommeil REM peut orienter les rêves vers des énigmes non résolues, aidant les gens à trouver des solutions créatives au réveil.",
