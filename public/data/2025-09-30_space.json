      "title": "Black hole discovery confirms Einstein and Hawking were right",
      "summary": "A fresh black hole merger detection has offered the clearest evidence yet for Einstein’s relativity and Hawking’s predictions. Scientists tracked the complete cosmic collision, confirming that black holes are defined by mass and spin. They also gained stronger proof that a black hole’s event horizon only grows, echoing thermodynamic laws. The results hint at deeper connections between gravity, entropy, and quantum theory.",
      "content": "A decade ago, scientists first detected ripples in the fabric of space-time, called gravitational waves, from the collision of two black holes. Now, thanks to improved technology and a bit of luck, a newly detected black hole merger is providing the clearest evidence yet of how black holes work -- and, in the process, offering long-sought confirmation of fundamental predictions by Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.\n\nThe new measurements were made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), with analyses led by astrophysicists Maximiliano Isi and Will Farr of the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City. The results reveal insights into the properties of black holes and the fundamental nature of space-time, hinting at how quantum physics and Einstein's general relativity fit together.\n\n\"This is the clearest view yet of the nature of black holes,\" says Isi, who is also an assistant professor at Columbia University. \"We've found some of the strongest evidence yet that astrophysical black holes are the black holes predicted from Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.\"\n\nThe results were reported in a paper published September 10 in Physical Review Letters by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.\n\nFor massive stars, black holes are the final stage in their evolution. Black holes are so dense that even light cannot escape their gravity. When two black holes collide, the event distorts space itself, creating ripples in space-time that fan out across the universe, like sound waves ringing out from a struck bell.\n\nThose space-deforming ripples, called gravitational waves, can tell scientists a great deal about the objects that created them. Just as a large iron bell makes different sounds than a smaller aluminum bell, the \"sound\" a black hole merger makes is specific to the properties of the black holes involved.\n\nScientists can detect gravitational waves with special instruments at observatories such as LIGO in the United States, Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan. These instruments carefully measure how long it takes a laser to travel a given path. As gravitational waves stretch and compress space-time, the length of the instrument, and thus the light's travel time, changes minutely. By measuring those tiny changes with great precision, scientists can use them to determine the black holes' characteristics.\n\nThe newly reported gravitational waves were found to be created by a merger that formed a black hole with the mass of 63 suns and spinning at 100 revolutions per second. The findings come 10 years after LIGO made the first black hole merger detection. Since that landmark discovery, improvements in equipment and techniques have enabled scientists to get a much clearer look at these space-shaking events.\n\n\"The new pair of black holes are almost twins to the historic first detection in 2015,\" Isi says. \"But the instruments are much better, so we're able to analyze the signal in ways that just weren't possible 10 years ago.\"\n\nWith these new signals, Isi and his colleagues got a complete look at the collision from the moment the black holes first careened into each other until the final reverberations as the merged black hole settled into its new state, which happened only milliseconds after first contact.\n\nPreviously, the final reverberations were difficult to capture, as by that point, the ringing of the black hole would be very faint. As a result, scientists couldn't separate the ringing of the collision from that of the final black hole itself.\n\nIn 2021, Isi led a study showcasing a cutting-edge method that he, Farr and others developed to isolate certain frequencies -- or 'tones' -- using data from the 2015 black hole merger. This method proved powerful, but the 2015 measurements weren't clear enough to confirm key predictions about black holes. With the new, more precise measurements, though, Isi and his colleagues were more confident they had successfully isolated the milliseconds-long signal of the final, settled black hole. This enabled more unambiguous tests of the nature of black holes.\n\n\"Ten milliseconds sounds really short, but our instruments are so much better now that this is enough time for us to really analyze the ringing of the final black hole,\" Isi says. \"With this new detection, we have an exquisitely detailed view of the signal both before and after the black hole merger.\"\n\nThe new observations allowed scientists to test a key conjecture dating back decades that black holes are fundamentally simple objects. In 1963, physicist Roy Kerr used Einstein's general relativity to mathematically describe black holes with one equation. The equation showed that astrophysical black holes can be described by just two characteristics: spin and mass. With the new, higher-quality data, the scientists were able to measure the frequency and duration of the ringing of the merged black hole more precisely than ever before. This allowed them to see that, indeed, the merged black hole is a simple object, described by just its mass and spin.\n\nThe observations were also used to test a foundational idea proposed by Stephen Hawking called Hawking's area theorem. It states that the size of a black hole's event horizon -- the line past which nothing, not even light, can return -- can only ever grow. Testing whether this theorem applies requires exceptional measurements of black holes before and after their merger. Following the first black hole merger detection in 2015, Hawking wondered if the merger signature could be used to confirm his theorem. At the time, no one thought it was possible.\n\nBy 2019, a year after Hawking's death, methods had improved enough that a first tentative confirmation came using techniques developed by Isi, Farr, and colleagues. With four times better resolution, the new data gives scientists much more confidence that Hawking's theorem is correct.\n\nIn confirming Hawking's theorem, the results also hint at connections to the second law of thermodynamics. This law states that a property that measures a system's disorder, known as entropy, must increase, or at least remain constant, over time. Understanding the thermodynamics of black holes could lead to advances in other areas of physics, including quantum gravity, which aims to merge general relativity with quantum physics.\n\n\"It's really profound that the size of a black hole's event horizon behaves like entropy,\" Isi says. \"It has very deep theoretical implications and means that some aspects of black holes can be used to mathematically probe the true nature of space and time.\"\n\nMany suspect that future black hole merger detections will only reveal more about the nature of these objects. In the next decade, detectors are expected to become 10 times more sensitive than today, allowing for more rigorous tests of black hole characteristics.\n\n\"Listening to the tones emitted by these black holes is our best hope for learning about the properties of the extreme space-times they produce,\" says Farr, who is also a professor at Stony Brook University. \"And as we build more and better gravitational wave detectors, the precision will continue to improve.\"\n\n\"For so long this field has been pure mathematical and theoretical speculation,\" Isi says. \"But now we're in a position of actually seeing these amazing processes in action, which highlights how much progress there's been -- and will continue to be -- in this field.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have been studying black holes for decades, but only recently have they been able to observe them directly through gravitational waves. These waves are ripples in space-time created when two black holes collide.\n\n**What happened** – Using improved instruments at observatories like LIGO, scientists detected a new black hole merger forming a black hole 63 times the mass of our sun, spinning 100 times per second.

      "summary": "The James Webb Telescope has revealed fierce auroras, storms, and unchanging sand-like clouds on the rogue planet SIMP-0136. These insights are pushing the boundaries of our understanding of alien atmospheres and exoplanet weather.",
      "content": "Strong Northern Lights-like activity is the standout feature of today’s weather report, which is coming at you from a strange, extrasolar world, instead of a standard TV studio. That is thanks to astronomers from Trinity College Dublin, who used the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope to take a close look at the weather of a toasty nearby rogue planet, SIMP-0136.\n\nThe exquisite sensitivity of the instruments on board the space-based telescope enabled the team to see minute changes in brightness of the planet as it rotated, which were used to track changes in temperature, cloud cover and chemistry.\n\nSurprisingly, these observations also illuminated SIMP-0136’s strong auroral activity, similar to the Northern Lights here on Earth or the powerful aurora on Jupiter, which heat up its upper atmosphere.\n\n“These are some of the most precise measurements of the atmosphere of any extra-solar object to date, and the first time that changes in the atmospheric properties have been directly measured,” said Dr Evert Nasedkin, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Trinity College Dublin’s School of Physics, who is the lead author of the research article just published in leading international journal, Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\n“And at over 1,500 °C, SIMP-0136 makes this summer’s heat wave look mild,” he continued. “The precise observations we made meant we could accurately record temperature changes smaller than 5 °C. These changes in temperature were related to subtle changes in the chemical composition of this free-floating planet, which is suggestive of storms – similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot – rotating into view.”\n\nAnother surprise finding was the lack of variability of the clouds on SIMP-0136. One might expect changes in the cloud coverage to lead to changes in the atmosphere, similar to observing patches of clouds and blue sky here on Earth. Instead, the team found that the cloud coverage was constant over the surface of SIMP-0136. At the temperatures of SIMP-0136 these clouds are unlike those on earth, instead composed of silicate grains, similar to sand on a beach.\n\nThis is the first publication from the new ‘Exo-Aimsir’ group led by Prof. Johanna Vos in Trinity’s School of Physics, and includes contributions from all the group members, including PhD candidates Merle Schrader, Madeline Lam and Cian O’Toole.\n\nThese data were initially published by a similar team led by Allison McCarthy at Boston University, but the new analysis has revealed more details about the atmosphere.\n\n“Different wavelengths of light are related to different atmospheric features. Similar to observing the changes in colour over the surface of the earth, the changes in the colour of SIMP-0136 are driven by changes in the atmospheric properties,” added Dr. Nasedkin. “So by using cutting-edge models, we could infer the temperature of the atmosphere, the chemical composition, and the position of the clouds.”\n\nProf. Vos said: “This work is exciting because it shows that by applying our state-of-the-art modelling techniques to cutting-edge datasets from JWST, we can begin to piece together the processes that drive weather in worlds beyond our solar system. Understanding these weather processes will be crucial as we continue to discover and characterize exoplanets in the future.”\n\n“While for now these types of spectroscopic variability observations are limited to isolated brown dwarfs, like this one, future observations with the Extremely Large Telescope and eventually the Habitable Worlds Observatory will enable the study of the atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets, from Jupiter-like gas giants to rocky worlds.”",

      "summary": "Scientists have shown that Earth’s basic chemistry solidified within just three million years of the Solar System’s formation. Initially, the planet was barren and inhospitable, missing water and carbon compounds. A colossal collision with Theia likely changed everything, bringing the essential ingredients for life. The study highlights that habitability may hinge on rare chance events.",
      "content": "After the formation of the Solar System, it took a maximum of three million years for the chemical composition of the Earth's precursor to be completed. This is shown by a new study by the Institute of Geological Sciences at the University of Bern. At this time, however, there were hardly any elements necessary for life such as water or carbon compounds on the young planet. Only a later planetary collision probably brought water to Earth, paving the way for life.\n\nEarth is so far the only known planet on which life exists -- with liquid water and a stable atmosphere. However, the conditions were not conducive to life when it formed. The gas-dust cloud from which all the planets in the Solar System formed was rich in volatile elements essential for life, such as hydrogen, carbon and sulphur. However, in the inner Solar System -- the part closest to the Sun, where the four rocky planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars and the asteroid belt are located today -- these volatile elements could hardly exist: Due to the high temperature of the Sun, they did not condense and initially remained largely in the gas phase. As these gaseous substances were not incorporated into the solid rocky materials from which the planets were formed, the early precursor of the Earth, the so-called proto-Earth, also contained very little of these vital substances. Only celestial bodies that formed further away from the Sun in cooler regions were able to incorporate these components. When and how the Earth became a life-friendly planet is still not fully understood.\n\nIn a new study, researchers from the Institute of Geological Sciences at the University of Bern have now been able to show for the first time that the chemical composition of the early Earth was complete no later than three million years after the formation of the Solar System -- and in a way that initially made the emergence of life impossible. Their results, recently published in the journal Science Advances, suggest that life on Earth was only made possible by a later event. Dr. Pascal Kruttasch is first author of the study, which was part of his dissertation at the Institute of Geological Sciences and was financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Kruttasch is now an SNSF Postdoc Mobility Fellow at Imperial College London.\n\nUsing a precise clock to measure the history of the Earth's formation\n\nThe research team used a combination of isotope and element data from meteorites and terrestrial rocks to reconstruct the process of the Earth's formation. Using model calculations, the researchers were able to narrow down in time how the chemical composition of the Earth developed in comparison to other planetary building blocks.\n\nKruttasch explains: \"A high-precision time measurement system based on the radioactive decay of manganese-53 was used to determine the precise age. This isotope was present in the early Solar System and decayed to chromium-53 with a half-life of around 3.8 million years.\" This method allowed ages to be determined with an accuracy of less than one million years for materials that are several billion years old. \"These measurements were only possible because the University of Bern has internationally recognized expertise and infrastructure for the analysis of extraterrestrial materials and is a leader in the field of isotope geochemistry,\" says co-author Klaus Mezger, Professor Emeritus of Geochemistry at the Institute of Geological Sciences at the University of Bern.\n\nLife on Earth thanks to a cosmic coincidence?\n\nUsing model calculations, the research team was able to show that the chemical signature of the proto-Earth, i.e. the unique pattern of chemical substances of which it is composed, was already complete less than three million years after the formation of the Solar System. Their study thus provides empirical data on the time of formation of the original material of the young Earth. \"Our Solar System formed around 4,568 million years ago. Considering that it only took up to 3 million years to determine the chemical properties of the Earth, this is surprisingly fast,\" says first author Kruttasch.\n\nThe results of the study thus support the assumption that a later collision with another planet -- Theia -- brought the decisive turning point and made the Earth a life-friendly planet. Theia probably formed further out in the Solar System, where volatile substances such as water accumulated. \"Thanks to our results, we know that the proto-Earth was initially a dry rocky planet. It can therefore be assumed that it was only the collision with Theia that brought volatile elements to Earth and ultimately made life possible there,\" says Kruttasch.\n\nLife-friendliness in the universe cannot be taken for granted\n\nThe new study contributes significantly to our understanding of the processes in the early phase of the Solar System and provides clues as to when and how planets on which life is possible can form. \"The Earth does not owe its current life-friendliness to a continuous development, but probably to a chance event -- the late impact of a foreign, water-rich body. This makes it clear that life-friendliness in the universe is anything but a matter of course,\" says Mezger.\n\nThe next step would be to investigate the collision event between proto-Earth and Theia in more detail. \"So far, this collision event is insufficiently understood. Models are needed that can fully explain not only the physical properties of the Earth and Moon, but also their chemical composition and isotope signatures,\" concludes Kruttasch.",

      "content": "Black holes are so strange that physicists have long wondered if they are quite what they seem. Now we are set to find out if they are instead gravastars, fuzzballs or something else entirely\n\nChristian Gralingen\n\nSome things in cosmology may simply be unknowable. Why is there something rather than nothing? What lies outside the universe? What is inside a black hole? That last one has been niggling at astrophysicists for more than a century, but they may finally be on the brink of figuring it out.\n\nThe traditional answer is that inside a black hole is a singularity: an infinitely small point of infinite density. If singularities are real, that could tell us something profound – not just about black holes, but also about our understanding of physics writ large. But nothing, not even light, can escape a black hole, so it has long been thought impossible to tell if these seemingly implausible points truly exist, or if there is some unknown physics that prevents them from forming. But if there are no singularities, are black holes really black holes at all?\n\nA new breed of astronomer is currently developing both the theories and the tools that may help to figure out exactly that.\n\n“We’ve entered a new era. The subject has been transformed from a purely mathematical discipline, disconnected from observation, to a growing field with rich connections between theory and experiment. It feels like it’s a bit of a golden era,” says Alexandru Lupsasca, a black hole researcher at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.\n\nThis new era has been ushered in by the quest to find a theory beyond general relativity, which is our current best description of gravity. In 1915, Albert Einstein famously derived the field equations of general relativity, describing the ways the space-time continuum – the invisible “fabric” of the universe – can expand, warp and twist depending on the amount of mass or energy contained within it.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nNo sooner had Einstein published the equations than the seed of their destruction was discovered by the physicist Karl Schwarzschild. While serving in the German army during the first world war, Schwarzschild used Einstein’s equations to find a number now known as the Schwarzschild radius.\n\nThis essentially tells us at what size a celestial object will become a black hole based on its mass. So long as the object is larger than the Schwarzschild radius, it will continue to exist as normal. But if it should become smaller, then the gravity its matter produces will be so strong that nothing in the known universe can resist it. The matter inside the Schwarzschild radius – which now defines a spherical boundary known as the event horizon – collapses unimpeded to form a singularity.\n\nThis gives us the traditional structure of a black hole: a singularity surrounded by an event horizon. Once you have crossed the event horizon, you are lost to the universe forever, as the pull of the black hole’s gravity is overwhelming.\n\nSearching for singularities\n\nBut to physicists, singularities spell problems – they shouldn’t physically exist. “Singularities are nonsensical. The formation of a singularity is just a statement that the equations themselves are saying, ‘Hey, we don’t know what’s going on and we need to be replaced by a deeper theory,’” says Lupsasca.\n\nThe conundrum is that there is now an overwhelming body of evidence that black holes do exist. Astronomers see them all over the universe: at the centres of galaxies, in the aftermath of stellar explosions and, thanks to the work of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), in the way they set the very universe quivering.\n\nLIGO announced its first direct detection of these subtle ripples in the fabric of the universe, called gravitational waves, in 2016. They are key predictions of general relativity and are best generated by the collision of two black holes. A few years after the first LIGO detection, in 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration released the first-ever image of a black hole. Suddenly, the astronomical community started to realise that black holes were no longer the sole purview of theoreticians.\n\n“For sure, the fact that there’s better observational data has made people think more about black holes. Just because you have more data, you can essentially investigate more about these objects,” says Raúl Carballo-Rubio at the International School for Advanced Studies in Italy, who has been investigating how these new observational techniques might help finally answer the question of what’s really inside a black hole.\n\nJust because black holes seemingly do exist doesn’t mean that singularities must also be real. In fact, there is a widespread view among astrophysicists that they aren’t, and their appearance in the equations simply tells us where to look for new physics. “We have Newton, we have Einstein, and then we have the next layer of reality beyond Einstein’s theory. Singularities tell us where to look for it,” says Carballo-Rubio.\n\nTo unlock this next layer, physicists have proposed new physical processes that halt the formation of singularities. Theorists call it regularising black holes, and (perhaps confusingly) refer to the singularity-free black holes they can concoct in this way as “regular” black holes.\n\nThe most common approach involves a hypothetical new force of nature that resists gravity and grows in strength as the density of matter increases. It would become strong enough to make its presence felt at only the extreme densities found inside a black hole, which explains why we haven’t seen it in the universe at large. Inside a black hole, however, this force would produce a core of extremely – but not infinitely – dense matter.\n\nIt may sound relatively simple, but as Carballo-Rubio says, actually proving that such a force exists is another matter entirely. To nail it down, astronomers will have to find some sort of observational signature beyond the black hole itself. “When you regularise a black hole, this can change its gravitational field. So you will expect to have some small effects that can show up outside of the black hole,” says Carballo-Rubio.\n\nFor example, the black hole might spin differently, or it might warp the space-time outside it in unexpected ways. Both these potential effects have been generally known since the 1970s, when physicist James Bardeen investigated whether there were observational signatures that could confirm or refute the existence of a singularity inside black holes. But without the technology necessary to make these observations, the ideas languished. Now, technology is finally catching up with Bardeen’s half-century-old work, and his ideas are being revived.\n\nOne particularly promising idea now getting a new life is Bardeen’s calculation of the paths that light rays would take when passing a black hole at various distances. Most photons of light would hurtle right past the black hole, slingshotted away by its gravity. The closest-in would be caught and fall inside the event horizon.\n\nBetween these two possibilities, he identified a critical area close to the event horizon where photons could be temporarily captured into orbits around a black hole before heading back off into the universe. It meant that a black hole would always be surrounded by a bright ring of these escaping photons.\n\nThey are the luckiest photons in the universe because they have come as close as anything possibly can to a black hole without being lost forever. And any deviation from the photon ring’s expected shape and size according to relativity could be the smoking gun of new physics within the event horizon.\n\nAnalysis of the EHT’s 2019 black hole image revealed that the light around the black hole itself was a combination of glowing material falling to oblivion, and light from the photon ring. But to find any telltale deviation from general relativity, those two sources of light will have to be separated from one another. Although upgrades currently taking place to the EHT will boost its sensitivity, to really disentangle the photon ring from the inflowing matter would require a bigger telescope. That is a considerable problem because the EHT already combines data from radio telescopes spread across the planet, making it, in effect, a telescope the size of Earth.\n\nThe EHT has taken images of two supermassive black holes, M87* and Sagittarius A*, seen here in polarised light European Southern Observatory\n\nThis is where a proposed new mission comes in. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) would extend the EHT into space. If funded by NASA next year, it would be due to launch in 2031. It isn’t so much the amount of light the mission’s spacecraft would capture, but rather its distance from the observatories on the ground that would supply the critical information needed to sharpen the images.\n\nAt 20,000 kilometres from Earth, it would allow EHT to produce the most detailed images ever taken of black holes – or anything in the universe, for that matter. “All of a sudden, you will be able to see the photon ring clearly,” says Michael Johnson at Harvard University, a member of the scientific collaboration proposing the mission.\n\nThe light around black holes could reveal their secrets, but so could their darkness. If there is new physics to be found, it might also show up in the size of a black hole’s shadow, the dark circle around it caused by extreme distortion of space-time. Any new physics could cause the shadow’s size to differ from that expected from general relativity, but the trouble is that many of the effects are extremely subtle. “Now it’s really a matter of understanding how good your observations need to be in order to be able to tell these differences apart,” says Carballo-Rubio.\n\nIn 2022, Rahul Kumar Walia at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and his colleagues used EHT measurements to test four different proposals for regular black holes. They examined the observations of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way – our galaxy – and used them to calculate the predicted size of the black hole’s shadow under those four “regular” black hole space-times. In most cases, they found that the predictions were within 10 per cent of each other, well below the current observations’ ability to distinguish between them. They ruled out only one of the four proposals – but perhaps BHEX and the next generation of black hole observatories could do better. The bottom line is that, although we have been able to start the search for regular black holes, we may have to wait a while yet before we have the observational ability to hunt for them in earnest.\n\nBlack hole impostors\n\nHowever, there is another approach to removing the singularity that would be associated with much more noticeable observational effects. It is drastic: what if there are no such things as black holes at all? What if we have been fooled all these years by things that just look like them?\n\nThese objects would be stranger than even regular black holes. They would not only do away with the singularity, but with the event horizon as well. In short, they wouldn’t be black holes; they would only mimic the appearance of black holes from a distance. Up close, a black hole mimicker wouldn’t have a horizon, but a surface.\n\nPerhaps the most popular possibilities for such entities are gravastars, short for gravitational vacuum stars. First proposed in 2001 by Pawel Mazur at the University of South Carolina and Emil Mottola at the University of New Mexico, gravastars are regions of space filled with a concentration of repulsive energy similar to dark energy, which on a large scale is hypothesised to be responsible for accelerating the universe’s expansion. A gravastar is therefore a bubble of energy surrounded by a thin, ultra-dense shell of ordinary matter.\n\nBlack hole mimickers are something of a theoretician’s dream, as they require only a knowledge of mathematics and an active imagination to conjure them up. Unsurprisingly, a number of ideas have been proposed. These include boson stars, which could be agglomerations of hypothetical particles called axions; fuzzballs, which come from string theory and would be tangled balls of atomic strings; and electroweak stars, which would be made of ordinary matter but prevented from collapsing into black holes by hypothetical interactions that could take place between particles via the combination of electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force.\n\nDespite being conceptually diverse, the one thing all mimickers have in common is a surface, and that means they could be distinguished through gravitational waves. When a gravitational wave observatory detects two objects merging, the signal is a characteristic “chirp”. For black holes, the characteristics of the chirp are dictated only by their masses and spins. For black hole mimickers, however, the detectors would also be able to hear echoes caused by reflections from the surfaces of the merging objects.\n\nSome tentative evidence for such echoes was presented by Jahed Abedi, then at the Sharif University of Technology in Iran, and his colleagues in 2017 for three merger events, but other searches have come up empty. Nami Uchikata at the University of Tokyo, Japan, and her colleagues found nothing but noise in their analysis of events from three of LIGO’s observing runs. However, it isn’t time to rule out echoes just yet.\n\n“This means the echo signals are quite faint, even if they exist,” says Uchikata. “Or it might be because the echo mechanism is beyond our current understanding and we are failing to catch the signal within our current analysis frameworks.” In other words, a lot more merger events are needed to draw any definitive conclusions. To that end, the researchers are currently analysing events from the fourth LIGO observing run, which is ongoing. Another drawback is that they have to use templates derived from theoretical models to tell them what the echo signature might look like. So, if theorists haven’t yet come up with the correct description of a mimicker, the researchers may be unable to extract the signal from the data, even if it is there.\n\nIn the meantime, the search continues. “It is always about where the new physics kicks in,” says Carballo-Rubio. If that happens inside the event horizon, then we must consider regular black holes. If the new physics makes its presence felt just outside the event horizon, then the universe will be full of mimickers – and black holes as we currently conceive of them won’t exist at all.\n\nBut what if we find no new physics and confirm that singularities are indeed real? “If singularities do exist in nature, black holes would be some kind of ‘universal shredder’,” says Carballo-Rubio. Just as an office shredder takes documents and destroys them, so a black hole would do this for all matter and energy unlucky enough to fall inside – nothing could survive. This would force a rethink of some foundational ideas in physics, such as the idea that information in the universe cannot be destroyed.\n\nMore than this, we will have to accept that certain places in the universe are fundamentally unknowable. Physicists have long hoped that singularities are an inconvenience that would eventually be brushed away by new physics. If they can’t be, however, that could mean the inside of a black hole isn’t a place where new physics applies, but is somewhere where all the laws of physics break down irretrievably. “Personally, that is also an exciting result,” says Uchikata. But it would also be a troubling one, forcing us to concede that the universe is not entirely ruled by physics – and that the one place we can never see, the inside of a black hole, is also somewhere we can never truly understand.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Black holes are mysterious objects in space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. Scientists have long believed black holes contain a singularity, a point of infinite density, but this idea creates problems in physics. Until recently, it was impossible to observe what happens inside black holes.\n\n**What happened** – Thanks to new technology like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), scientists can now observe black holes more closely. They have detected gravitational waves from black hole collisions and even taken the first images of black holes. These advances are allowing researchers to test new ideas about what black holes really are. Some theories suggest black holes might not contain singularities but instead have new forms of matter or forces inside, or might even be objects that only look like black holes from far away.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it moves the study of black holes from just math and theory into real observation and testing. Understanding what happens inside black holes could change our knowledge of physics and the universe. For example, if singularities don’t exist, it means there is new physics to discover. Also, future missions like the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) could give us even clearer images, helping us find signs of these new physics ideas.\n\n**What’s next step** – Scientists are working on improving telescopes and analyzing more data from black hole collisions to find signs of these new ideas. The Black Hole Explorer mission, if approved, could launch by 2031 and help us see details like the “photon ring” around black holes more clearly. Meanwhile, researchers continue to search for echoes in gravitational waves that might show black holes have surfaces, not just event horizons.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New technologies and missions are bringing us closer than ever to understanding the true nature of black holes, potentially revealing new physics beyond current theories.",
