      "content": "To build a large-scale quantum computer that works, scientists and engineers need to overcome the spontaneous errors that quantum bits, or qubits, create as they operate.\n\nScientists encode these building blocks of quantum information to suppress errors in other qubits so that a minority can operate in a way that produces useful outcomes.\n\nAs the number of useful (or logical) qubits grows, the number of physical qubits required grows even further. As this scales up, the sheer number of qubits needed to create a useful quantum machine becomes an engineering nightmare.\n\nNow, for the first time, quantum scientists at the Quantum Control Laboratory at the University of Sydney Nano Institute have demonstrated a type of quantum logic gate that drastically reduces the number physical qubits needed for its operation.\n\nTo do this, they built an entangling logic gate on a single atom using an error-correcting code nicknamed the 'Rosetta stone' of quantum computing. It earns that name because it translates smooth, continuous quantum oscillations into clean, digital-like discrete states, making errors easier to spot and fix, and importantly, allowing a highly compact way to encode logical qubits.\n\nGKP Codes: A Rosetta Stone for Quantum Computing\n\nThis curiously named Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code has for many years offered a theoretical possibility for significantly reducing the physical number of qubits needed to produce a functioning 'logical qubit'. Albeit by trading efficiency for complexity, making the codes very difficult to control.\n\nResearch published on August 21 in Nature Physics demonstrates this as a physical reality, tapping into the natural oscillations of a trapped ion (a charged atom of ytterbium) to store GKP codes and, for the first time, realizing quantum entangling gates between them.\n\nLed by Sydney Horizon Fellow Dr Tingrei Tan at the University of Sydney Nano Institute, scientists have used their exquisite control over the harmonic motion of a trapped ion to bridge the coding complexity of GKP qubits, allowing a demonstration of their entanglement.\n\n\"Our experiments have shown the first realization of a universal logical gate set for GKP qubits,\" Dr Tan said. \"We did this by precisely controlling the natural vibrations, or harmonic oscillations, of a trapped ion in such a way that we can manipulate individual GKP qubits or entangle them as a pair.\"\n\nQuantum Logic Gate and Software Innovation\n\nA logic gate is an information switch that allows computers - quantum and classical - to be programmable to perform logical operations. Quantum logic gates use the entanglement of qubits to produce a completely different sort of operational system to that used in classical computing, underpinning the great promise of quantum computers.\n\nFirst author Vassili Matsos is a PhD student in the School of Physics and Sydney Nano. He said: \"Effectively, we store two error-correctable logical qubits in a single trapped ion and demonstrate entanglement between them.\n\n\"We did this using quantum control software developed by Q-CTRL, a spin-off start-up company from the Quantum Control Laboratory, with a physics-based model to design quantum gates that minimize the distortion of GKP logical qubits, so they maintain the delicate structure of the GKP code while processing quantum information.\"\n\nA Milestone in Quantum Technology\n\nWhat Mr Matsos did is entangle two 'quantum vibrations' of a single atom. The trapped atom vibrates in three dimensions. Movement in each dimension is described by quantum mechanics and each is considered a 'quantum state'. By entangling two of these quantum states realized as qubits, Mr Matsos created a logic gate using just a single atom, a milestone in quantum technology.\n\nThis result massively reduces the quantum hardware required to create these logic gates, which allow quantum machines to be programmed.\n\nDr Tan said: \"GKP error correction codes have long promised a reduction in hardware demands to address the resource overhead challenge for scaling quantum computers. Our experiments achieved a key milestone, demonstrating that these high-quality quantum controls provide a key tool to manipulate more than just one logical qubit.\n\n\"By demonstrating universal quantum gates using these qubits, we have a foundation to work towards large-scale quantum-information processing in a highly hardware-efficient fashion.\"\n\nAcross three experiments described in the paper, Dr Tan's team used a single ytterbium ion contained in what is known as a Paul trap. This uses a complex array of lasers at room temperature to hold the single atom in the trap, allowing its natural vibrations to be controlled and utilized to produce the complex GKP codes.\n\nThis research represents an important demonstration that quantum logic gates can be developed with a reduced physical number of qubits, increasing their efficiency.\n\nThe authors declare no competing interests.

      "personality_title": "Scientists create quantum logic gate using a single atom to simplify quantum computing",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Quantum computers use tiny units called qubits to process information, but errors often happen that make it hard to build large, reliable machines. To fix these mistakes, many physical qubits are usually needed to create just one error-corrected logical qubit, which makes building big quantum computers very complicated.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of Sydney have built a quantum logic gate using just one atom. They used a special error-correcting method called the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code, which allows multiple logical qubits to be stored in the natural vibrations of a single trapped ion (a charged atom). This is the first time scientists have entangled two logical qubits inside one atom, creating a working quantum gate with much fewer physical qubits.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it shows a new way to reduce the number of physical qubits needed in quantum computers. By controlling the vibrations of a single atom, the team made quantum operations more compact and efficient. This breakthrough could help make quantum computers easier to build and scale up, overcoming one of the biggest challenges in the field.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers plan to continue improving their control over these GKP qubits and to build more complex quantum circuits using fewer atoms. This work lays the foundation for creating larger quantum computers that use less hardware, making them more practical for real-world problems.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have built a quantum logic gate inside a single atom using advanced error correction, reducing the hardware needed to build powerful quantum computers.",

It stays stable under real-world conditions and can be reused many times, making it ideal for energy and electronic applications. This innovation could reshape technologies from fuel cells to eco-friendly smart windows.",
      "content": "A team of scientists from Korea and Japan has discovered a new type of crystal that can \"breathe\" -- releasing and absorbing oxygen repeatedly at relatively low temperatures. This unique ability could transform the way we develop clean energy technologies, including fuel cells, energy-saving windows, and smart thermal devices.\n\nThe newly developed material is a special kind of metal oxide made of strontium, iron, and cobalt. What makes it extraordinary is that it can release oxygen when heated in a simple gas environment and then take it back in, all without falling apart. This process can be repeated many times, making it ideal for real-world applications.\n\nThis remarkable study has been led by Professor Hyoungjeen Jeen from the Department of Physics, Pusan National University, Korea, and co-authored by Professor Hiromichi Ohta from the Research Institute for Electronic Science, Hokkaido University, Japan. Their findings have been published in the journal Nature Communications on August 15, 2025. \"It is like giving the crystal lungs and it can inhale and exhale oxygen on command,\" says Prof. Jeen. Controlling oxygen in materials is crucial for technologies like solid oxide fuel cells, which produce electricity from hydrogen with minimal emissions. It also plays a role in thermal transistors -- devices that can direct heat like electrical switches -- and in smart windows that adjust their heat flow depending on the weather.\n\nUntil now, most materials that could do this kind of oxygen control were too fragile or operated only at the harsh conditions like extremely high temperatures. This new material works under milder conditions and remains stable. \"This finding is striking in two ways: only cobalt ions are reduced, and the process leads to the formation of an entirely new but stable crystal structure,\" explains Prof. Jeen. They also showed that the material could return to its original form when oxygen was reintroduced, proving that the process is fully reversible. \"This is a major step towards the realization of smart materials that can adjust themselves in real time,\" says Prof. Ohta. \"The potential applications range from clean energy to electronics and even eco-friendly building materials.\"\n\nFunding: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (RS-2025-00558200).

It’s still pretty hot. And so I’m kind of ready for it to cool down a little bit. And yeah, that’s kind of all that’s been on top of my mind lately, but for the most part, doing well.

It’s hard to be optimistic when you can’t breathe. But you know, we’re making it through. I guess that’s my I’m an optimist, but… of the week. Do you have anything else?\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. Yeah, I do actually. Because just right before the podcast recording, I got a spam call and I don’t know about our listeners out there, but I get like 3 to 5 spam calls every day…\n\nArielle:\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. And it’s just so annoying because every time it’s a different number. I block it every time… But I’ve seen a lot of other people complain about this too, and it doesn’t seem like there’s really a viable solution out there. But it’s just so annoying. So if anyone does have any tips for this on how to make these scam/spam callers stop, please let me know because it’s so annoying that you have to deal with this! I just wish there were some futuristic developments that could solve this simple yet apparently complex problem.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, I wish I had a solution for you, but alas, I do not. I also just block the numbers and move on, and it’s more of a Band-Aid solution than anything. But I do kind of have a futuristic solution that I’m going to talk about today.\n\nKarissa:\n\nOK, well, I am happy to hear it. Let’s talk about it.\n\nArielle:\n\nAll right! So it’s titled Scientists develop BCI tech to decode inner speech—with a brain-powered privacy password.\n\nKarissa:\n\nNice.\n\nArielle:\n\nIt goes into detail about how researchers at Stanford have developed a new brain-computer interface, or BCI, that can, as the title says, decode quote-unquote inner speech. That means instead of having to try to speak out loud, people could just think the words they want to say and the system would translate those thoughts into text or speech.\n\nKarissa:\n\nOh my gosh, this is already so crazy to think about. I guess it means no muscle movement at all. It’s just straight from your brain to text.\n\nArielle:\n\nExactly. And this is a huge deal for people with conditions like ALS, where speech becomes really difficult or eventually impossible. Usually, BCI systems for people with ALS require users to try to move their mouth or tongue, which can be really exhausting. This new system skips all of that effort.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, well, that sounds like a major upgrade. And how does it actually work?\n\nArielle:\n\nSo in a new study published in the journal Cell, four participants, including Casey Harrell, a longtime ALS patient who’s been part of Stanford’s trials, used the interface just by imagining themselves speaking. No actual movement. Harrell had already regained some speech with earlier BCI systems that combined brain signals and recordings of his voice from before he lost speech. But this study takes it even further.\n\nKarissa:\n\nOh, OK. So how much success did they have with this?\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, at first the results were not great. The AI models didn’t pick up the words very clearly, but the researchers retrained their systems and eventually got to a point where the computer could reliably translate full phrases like “I don’t know how long you’ve been here,” and that’s pretty advanced for inner speech.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, I mean, that’s pretty wild. But I can imagine that mind-reading tech can raise some concerns. Maybe privacy concerns as well.\n\nArielle:\n\nTotally. The team at Stanford noticed that sometimes the system would pick up words the participants didn’t actually want to say out loud. That’s where the mental privacy issue came in. To address it, they built in a kind of brain-based password.\n\nKarissa:\n\nOh OK, so a password in your head. How does this work?\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, it sounds so sci-fi, but the participants imagined a specific phrase—Chitty Chitty Bang Bang—before and after a phrase they actually wanted to say.\n\nKarissa:\n\nUh-huh.\n\nArielle:\n\nThe Chitty Chitty Bang Bang acted as an on-and-off switch for the system. The computer only decoded what was between those mental bookmarks, and it worked 98.75 percent of the time.\n\nKarissa:\n\nOK. Well, that’s impressively accurate. So that’s good.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, it is. And it’s smart, too. According to the New York Times, the team wanted something that wouldn’t show up in normal inner dialogue, so something like “I need groceries” wouldn’t accidentally activate the system.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. That makes sense. And I guess, are there any other teams working on similar tech? Because this is completely new and amazing.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, pretty cutting edge. But yes, to answer your question. For instance, in 2023, researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley developed a BCI system that could translate brain activity into speech using just a small set of electrodes and a neural network trained on hours of brain data. But their system still required users to attempt speech or mouth movements.\n\nKarissa:\n\nSo it seems like the Stanford study is unique because it removes that physical step altogether.\n\nArielle:\n\nYes, precisely. And that’s a big deal. The ultimate goal here is making communication easier and less taxing, especially for people whose energy is already so limited. Erin Kunz, one of the researchers and co-author of the study, said that inner speech decoding could let users interact more without tiring themselves out, which is key for maintaining relationships and autonomy.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. And it sounds like they’re also thinking carefully about the ethical implications here.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, they are, and they should be, because as this tech evolves, the question becomes not just can we decode thoughts, but when should we decode thoughts? The idea of a brain-computer interface that reads your mind is definitely exciting, but it also needs safeguards. That’s why the password feature is so important. It gives control back to the user.\n\nKarissa:\n\nIt’s really fascinating, and this is such an interesting development in this kind of technology. So, I think it’s great, and you know, it really feels like we’re entering a new era of assistive technology.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah. And we definitely are entering this new crazy era. This was a small trial, just a proof of concept, but it shows real promise if developed further. Inner speech BCIs could restore communication for so many people who have lost their voice.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. And with privacy and dignity intact… because it feels like true privacy in tech is really hard to come by in the era of data mining that’s going on right now. But this is the kind of future tech I can actually get behind, because it’s kind of a scary development when you think about it, but I mean it has the potential, as we said, to revolutionize assistive communication.\n\nArielle:\n\nMm-hmm. Yeah. And I can just imagine for people with loved ones who… maybe their dad has ALS or something, or their mom, or a really close friend of theirs, and they just can’t communicate the way that they used to. This could be so, so meaningful for them.\n\nIt’s scary and exciting!\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nArielle:\n\nBut Karissa, do you have anything scary and exciting? (laughs)\n\nKarissa:\n\nI guess I do kind of have a scary and exciting solution to talk about.\n\nArielle:\n\nAll right!\n\nKarissa:\n\n5 avoidable injuries that send people to the ER (and how to stay out of trouble).\n\nThis solution was really calling my name this week because, spoiler alert, we’re going to talk about one of the most popular ER visit culprits—which is the avocado hand. I had my own run-in with an avocado when I was camping this summer. I was not being knife-safe, and I just punctured it trying to get the pit out and it just went and got my finger really good…\n\nArielle:\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nKarissa:\n\n…and I didn’t have to go to the ER, but it was still a nasty cut and it was right when the camping trip started. So a great way to start, of course. But before I dive in—Arielle, have you ever been in the ER for something that was kind of ordinary, or even just in general, have you had an ER experience?\n\nArielle:\n\nUm, for someone who is generally pretty clumsy, I have not ended up in the ER, which I’m really happy about.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nMy partner, he got hit by a really big electric bike and he broke his pinky. So that’s the last experience I’ve had in the ER. But that wasn’t even me, so…\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. Well, we’ll talk about those electric bikes in this article too, because they are also a culprit of these common ER visits.\n\nArielle:\n\nOkay.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI think we forget that ER visits aren’t always the result of a dramatic car crash or exotic animal bites. Sometimes it can just be you, your kitchen, and an innocent-looking avocado conspiring to ruin your camping trip, maybe.\n\nArielle:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nKarissa:\n\nBut according to ER doctors, a huge portion of emergency room injuries are both shockingly common and totally preventable.\n\nArielle:\n\nFascinating. I always think of the ER as being a place to go when you are in a critical condition, but I guess that isn’t always the case.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. And according to the CDC, injuries make up nearly 30 percent of all ER visits. But unlike, say, heart attacks or freak accidents, many of these injuries boil down to a handful of everyday missteps—quite often literally. So here are the top five injuries ER docs say they see all the time, plus their very practical and occasionally hilariously blunt advice for how to stay out of the waiting room.\n\nArielle:\n\nI’m interested!\n\nKarissa:\n\nNumber one is: Tripping hazards are sneakier than you think.\n\nAnd you know, it’s not just bungee jumping or rock climbing that’s landing people in the ER. It’s the good old staircase.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, I know I have almost fallen victim to a staircase many times, especially because here in Amsterdam, so many of the staircases are basically like ladders and super narrow.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. And I mean, if you’re in a hurry or just not really paying attention, it’s easy to misstep—and in the worst case, take a tumble. But wearing the wrong footwear also doesn’t help in general. Because if you’re, you know, taking a hike in slides or flip-flops, or maybe crossing ice in a pair of Crocs, or teetering on gravel in stilettos, it might not end up well.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, it’s definitely important to pick the right footwear for the occasion.\n\nKarissa:\n\nAbsolutely. And as Mark Conroy, MD, urges, dress for the terrain and carry fewer things at a time so you can actually see where you’re walking.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, good advice.\n\nKarissa:\n\nAnd the second little pointer here is: Put the knives down (and grab a cutting board).\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, this sounds like what you were talking about earlier, Karissa.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYes! So, as this article says, if you’ve ever attempted to pit an avocado by stabbing it with a knife—stop. As Dr. Conroy says, avocado hand is a frequent flyer at the ER, as is its cousin, the bagel hand. While Dr. Mark Morocco recommends wearing cut-resistant safety gloves when handling knives, Dr. Rade Vukmir warns against slicing anything with confusing texture in general—so, you know, soft on the outside, hard on the inside like an avocado—while holding it in your hand.\n\nAnd don’t even get the ER doctors started on mandolins, because, as Jeff Baker, DO from Palm Springs says, they elicit groans.\n\nArielle:\n\nAh.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThey have beautiful slices, but brutal injuries.\n\nArielle:\n\nYes, I know I have given myself little cuts before in the kitchen by accident from these sharp tools, and they’re just everywhere here because the Dutch love their cheese!\n\nKarissa:\n\nI’m also definitely guilty of getting little cuts from things like this too. So #3 on this list is: Be careful of big risks from two wheels.\n\nI mean, e-bikes, scooters, and bicycles account for more ER injuries than you might guess, ranging from nasty road rashes to traumatic brain injuries. At the worst-case scenario, Dr. Morocco has even seen entire bodies “cheese-gratered.”\n\nArielle:\n\nOh gosh.\n\nKarissa:\n\nWhich I personally don’t even want to imagine.\n\nArielle:\n\nMe neither. But that begs the question: where is the riskiest area to ride these two wheels?\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. Well, Dr. Baker says the most dangerous rides happen on city streets with high-speed traffic. So if you insist on scooting around, wear a helmet. And no, it’s not optional. And also consider foam-padded safety glasses too. Dr. Morocco insists that you really don’t want a bug flying into your eyes at 20 miles per hour.\n\nArielle:\n\nThat’s a great point. You do not want your visibility to be impacted, and it’s pretty painful to have a bug in your eye. It happened to me last week, but I wasn’t going very fast.\n\nKarissa:\n\nAnd I guess on that note too—don’t text and ride. Stay visible, pick stable roads, and think of this as a ride-or-crash scenario, because at the end of the day, you are on a moving vehicle.\n\nThe fourth pointer that we have is: Ladders: danger disguised as helpful.\n\nArielle:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nKarissa:\n\nDr. Baker says that using a ladder to trim trees or reach the roof is basically asking for trouble, because even a six-foot fall can break bones. ER docs often advise hiring someone instead.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, I guess we can’t all be professional ladder users.\n\nKarissa:\n\nBut if you must do it yourself, place the ladder on solid ground. Make sure it’s structurally sound. And yes, somebody should be nearby in case of an emergency—but not to hold the ladder, because that rarely ends well.\n\nArielle:\n\nOh, OK. Noted.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYep. It’s also really important to be safe indoors when you’re trying to reach something high, because step stools are deceptively dangerous. People fall off trying to reach the top of the fridge all the time. So always use the right-height stool, keep it centered, and maintain one hand on a stable surface.\n\nArielle:\n\nAs a pretty short person, I really need to be careful with the step stools. I often just climb on top of the actual counter because I feel way sturdier there.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI see—me too! And maybe that’s not the safest either. Sometimes I’ll just grab whatever chair is closest, and sometimes that’s a swivel chair…\n\nArielle:\n\nOh no.\n\nKarissa:\n\n…which I’m sure these docs are cringing at, because, you know, the swivel is even more dangerous—not sturdy. So, keep it sturdy, guys.\n\nAnd the fifth and final pointer here is: Protect your eyeballs, please.\n\nBecause, you want to know what hurts? A tiny piece of metal or wood flying into your eye while you’re mowing the lawn, grinding metal, or leaf-blowing without safety glasses. Dr. Conroy warns that this can lead to scratched corneas or even an open globe injury—which is also known as a puncture in your actual eyeball.\n\nArielle:\n\nI don’t like thinking about that.\n\nKarissa:\n\nMe either.\n\nArielle:\n\nSo everyone: please wear those safety glasses.\n\nKarissa:\n\nLuckily for me, growing up with my dad—who works in kind of like construction-esque jobs—safety glasses were always around, and he would always put them on. So definitely, if you don’t have a pair, go get some so you have them when you’re doing these chores that have things flying around. Because even though they’re not glamorous, neither is spending your afternoon explaining to an ER nurse how a leaf got lodged in your retina.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah.\n\nKarissa:\n\nHopefully these pointers will be a solution for keeping you out of the ER for silly little mistakes.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, this is a really practical and helpful solution for you to share, Karissa. Thank you so much.\n\nKarissa:\n\nAnd we also had some other great solutions this week on The Optimist Daily.\n\nArielle:\n\nYes! They include: Back-to-school shopping without the meltdown: How to keep trends and budgets in check. UK launches world’s first gonorrhoea vaccine rollout amid record infection rates. Ancient conch blowing practice shows promise for easing sleep apnoea symptoms. And How to cut grocery bills and waste less: 9 clever, planet-friendly hacks.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThe grass-eating mystery: Why cats and dogs snack on greens. Tiny robots offer lasting relief for tooth sensitivity, scientists say. New treatment helps type 1 diabetes patient produce insulin without immunosuppressants. And 7 Pilates mistakes instructors wish you’d stop (and what to do instead).\n\nArielle:\n\nAmazing. Well, thank you so much as usual, Karissa, for spending another Friday with me talking about our favorite solutions from the Optimist Daily.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, great to be here. And looking forward to next week to share some more solutions with everybody.\n\nArielle:\n\nIn the meantime, we wish all of our listeners and readers and fellow optimists a wonderful weekend.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. Alrighty. Bye everyone.\n\nArielle:\n\nBye.",

Credit: ResilienX\n\nA future with advanced air mobility aircraft populating the skies will require the U.S. to implement enhanced preflight planning that can mitigate potential risks well before takeoff – and NASA is working to develop the tools to make that happen.\n\nPreflight planning is critical to ensuring safety in the complex, high-risk environments of the future airspace. Timely, predictive, and up-to-date risk assessment within a single platform makes it much easier for drone or air taxi operators to check flight plans for high-risk concerns.\n\nNASA is working on tools to deliver those services, and in June, the agency and aviation safety company ResilienX Inc. demonstrated how these tools can be integrated into commercial systems.\n\nDuring a series of tests conducted at ResilienX’s facility in Syracuse, New York, researchers used NASA services that allowed flight operators to submit flight plans prior to departure, obtain risk assessment results, and then decide whether to proceed with flights or change their flight plans and re-assess risks. Allowing operators to perform these tasks quickly reduces the safety risk to flight passengers as well as humans on the ground.\n\nThe three NASA-developed services are intended to assess unique risks associated with highly automated aircraft flying at low altitudes over cities.\n\nThe partnership was managed under a Phase III NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract, which is an extension of prior work to assess weather-related risks. This collaboration is already leading to direct technology transfer of safety systems into ResilienX’s platform. The partnership is also intended to provide indirect benefits for ResilienX partners and customers, such as the U.S. Air Force and regional operators, helping to advance the overall safety of future airspace operations.\n\nThis work is led by NASA’s System-Wide Safety project under the Airspace Operations and Safety program in support of the agency’s Advanced Air Mobility mission. The mission seeks to deliver data, findings, and recommendations to guide the industry’s development of future air taxis and drones.",
