      "summary": "Researchers have discovered a biological switch that explains why movement keeps bones strong. The protein senses physical activity and pushes bone marrow stem cells to build bone instead of storing fat, slowing age-related bone loss. By targeting this “exercise sensor,” scientists believe they could create drugs that mimic exercise at the molecular level. The approach could protect fragile bones in people who are unable to stay active.",
      "content": "Researchers from the Department of Medicine at the School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) have identified a biological process that explains how physical activity helps maintain strong bones. The discovery could lead to new treatments for osteoporosis and bone loss, particularly for people who are unable to exercise.\n\nThe team found that a specific protein acts as the body's internal \"exercise sensor,\" allowing bones to respond to physical movement. This insight opens the possibility of developing medications that replicate the benefits of exercise, offering new hope for older adults, bedridden patients, and individuals with chronic illnesses who face a higher risk of fractures. The findings were published in the journal Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy.\n\n\"Osteoporosis and age-related bone loss affect millions worldwide, often leaving elderly and bedridden patients vulnerable to fractures and loss of independence,\" said Professor Xu Aimin, Director of the State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and Chair Professor in the Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, HKUMed, who led the study. \"Current treatments rely heavily on physical activity, which many patients simply cannot perform. We need to understand how our bones get stronger when we move or exercise before we can find a way to replicate the benefits of exercise at the molecular level. This study is a critical step towards that goal.\"\n\nWhy Bone Loss Becomes More Severe With Age\n\nBone fractures caused by osteoporosis are a widespread global health problem. According to the World Health Organization, about one in three women and one in five men over the age of 50 will experience a fracture due to weakened bones. In Hong Kong, the impact is particularly significant as the population ages, with osteoporosis affecting 45% of women and 13% of men aged 65 and older. These fractures often result in long-term pain, reduced mobility, and loss of independence, while also placing major strain on healthcare systems.\n\nAs people age, bones naturally lose density and become more porous. Inside the bone marrow are mesenchymal stem cells, which can develop into either bone tissue or fat cells. These cells respond strongly to physical forces such as movement and pressure. Over time, however, aging shifts this balance, causing more of these stem cells to turn into fat cells instead of bone.\n\nWhen fat accumulates inside the bone marrow, it crowds out healthy bone tissue. This process weakens bones further and creates a cycle of deterioration that is difficult to reverse using current therapies.\n\nPiezo1 Acts as the Bone's Exercise Sensor\n\nThrough experiments using mouse models and human stem cells, the researchers identified a protein called Piezo1 located on the surface of mesenchymal stem cells in bone marrow. This protein functions as a mechanical sensor, detecting physical forces generated during movement and exercise.\n\nWhen Piezo1 is activated through physical activity in mice, it limits fat buildup in the bone marrow and promotes new bone formation. When the protein is absent, the opposite occurs. Stem cells are more likely to become fat cells, accelerating bone loss. The lack of Piezo1 also triggers the release of inflammatory signals (Ccl2 and lipocalin-2), which further push stem cells toward fat production and interfere with bone growth. Blocking these signals was shown to help restore healthier bone conditions.\n\nMimicking Exercise for People Who Cannot Move\n\n\"We have essentially decoded how the body converts movement into stronger bones,\" said Professor Xu Aimin. \"We have identified the molecular exercise sensor, Piezo1, and the signalling pathways it controls. This gives us a clear target for intervention. By activating the Piezo1 pathway, we can mimic the benefits of exercise, effectively tricking the body into thinking it is exercising, even in the absence of movement.\"\n\nDr Wang Baile, Research Assistant Professor in the same department and co-leader of the study, emphasized the importance of the findings for vulnerable populations. \"This discovery is especially meaningful for older individuals and patients who cannot exercise due to frailty, injury or chronic illness. Our findings open the door to developing 'exercise mimetics' -- drugs that chemically activate the Piezo1 pathway to help maintain bone mass and support independence.\"\n\nProfessor Eric Honoré, Team Leader at the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, French National Centre for Scientific Research, and co-leader of the research, highlighted the broader potential impact. \"This offers a promising strategy beyond traditional physical therapy. In the future, we could potentially provide the biological benefits of exercise through targeted treatments, thereby slowing bone loss in vulnerable groups such as the bedridden patients or those with limited mobility, and substantially reducing their risk of fractures.\"\n\nMoving Toward New Osteoporosis Treatments\n\nThe research team is now focused on translating these findings into clinical applications. Their goal is to develop new therapies that preserve bone strength and improve quality of life for aging individuals and those confined to bed.\n\nThe collaborative study was co-led by Professor Xu Aimin, Rosie T T Young Professor in Endocrinology and Metabolism, Chair Professor and Director, and Dr Wang Baile, Research Assistant Professor, State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Medicine, HKUMed. The project also involved Professor Eric Honoré from the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), Université Côte d'Azur (UniCA), and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm), who is also a Visiting Professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, HKUMed.\n\nThis research was supported by the Areas of Excellence Scheme and the General Research Fund of the Research Grants Council; the Health and Medical Research Fund under the Health Bureau, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China; the National Key R&D Program of China; the National Natural Science Foundation of China; the Human Frontier Science Program; the French National Research Agency; Fondation de France; Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale; and the Macau Science and Technology Development Fund.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Bones get stronger when we move because physical activity tells the body to build bone instead of fat inside the bone marrow. But many older or sick people cannot exercise, which makes their bones weaker and more likely to break.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of Hong Kong discovered a protein called Piezo1 that acts like an internal sensor for exercise in bone marrow stem cells. When activated by movement, Piezo1 helps these cells create bone tissue and stops fat from building up inside bones. The team showed this in mice and human cells and found that without Piezo1, bones lose strength faster.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery explains how bones sense exercise at the molecular level. More importantly, it suggests scientists can make drugs that activate Piezo1 to mimic exercise benefits. This could help people who cannot move due to age, illness, or injury keep their bones strong and avoid fractures.\n\n**What's next step** – The research team will work on turning this discovery into real treatments. They aim to develop medicines that activate Piezo1 and protect bones for older adults and patients who cannot exercise. Future studies will test these drugs and see if they can safely slow down bone loss.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Researchers found a protein that lets bones benefit from exercise signals, opening the way to drugs that keep bones strong even when people cannot move.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nWhen Dawn Daly-Mack checked her mailbox one ordinary day, she nearly tossed an envelope she assumed was junk. Instead, she thought twice and opened it, finding a message that was far from mundane.\n\n“I opened it up and it said, ‘Your medical bill has been paid,’” says Daly-Mack, 60, who lives in Gaston, North Carolina. “I didn’t believe it.”\n\nThe letter was real. Her $459 medical bill, dating back to a 2014 emergency room visit for a sinus infection, had been erased. Daly-Mack is one of roughly 2.5 million North Carolinians whose medical debt vanished under a sweeping new agreement between the state and its hospitals.\n\nAt the time of that hospital visit, Daly-Mack was supporting her family as the sole breadwinner while caring for her disabled husband and two teenagers. “I was not able to pay the bill,” she says. Adding to the irony, she was working as a nurse at the very same hospital that was attempting to collect the debt.\n\nClearing the past and fixing the system\n\nNorth Carolina’s approach went far beyond wiping out old balances. All 99 hospitals in the state agreed to stop collecting certain medical debts going back to 2014. Just as importantly, they committed to preventing future debt by automatically discounting care for patients who qualify for financial assistance, without forcing them to apply.\n\nFor a family of four, that threshold now includes households earning under $96,000 a year.\n\n“I’m excited for the people of North Carolina,” says Allison Sesso, CEO of Undue Medical Debt, the nonprofit that worked with hospitals to identify eligible patients. “It pairs not just medical debt relief going backwards, but it fixes the upstream problems.”\n\nHospitals collaborated with Sesso’s team to locate qualifying accounts and notify patients directly, turning years of financial stress into unexpected relief.\n\nA personal mission behind the policy\n\nFor Kody Kinsley, North Carolina’s former secretary of health, medical debt was never an abstract policy issue.\n\n“My second year of college, my father had a massive stroke,” Kinsley recalls. His family lacked health insurance, and the fear was immediate. “A key thought in her mind was, ‘We don’t have health insurance. Oh my God. We’re gonna end up in debt.’”\n\nKinsley was eventually able to secure a hospital discount, but as health secretary years later, he heard similar stories again and again. Even after Medicaid expansion in 2023 brought coverage to 675,000 more residents, many people remained weighed down by older medical bills.\n\n“They had a forward path, but they were still wrestling with that backward,” he says.\n\nThat insight shaped the state’s strategy. North Carolina tied additional Medicaid funding for hospitals to forgiving medical debt dating back to 2014, the earliest year the state could have expanded Medicaid. Hospitals also agreed to remove paperwork hurdles by automatically applying financial assistance.\n\n“People can walk in the front door of a hospital in an emergency situation and not feel like they’re taking both their health and their financial well-being at risk in that moment,” Kinsley says.\n\nA national patchwork of solutions\n\nNorth Carolina’s effort stands out, but it is not happening in isolation. Across the country, states are experimenting with ways to overcome a medical debt crisis estimated at $220 billion, affecting roughly one in 12 Americans.\n\nArizona and New Jersey have used public funds to buy and forgive medical debt. Oregon and Illinois now screen patients for financial assistance earlier. Colorado and New York have banned medical debt from credit reports, though similar federal protections were recently rolled back.\n\nHeather Howard, director of Princeton University’s State Health and Value Strategies program, welcomes the momentum but is concerned about inconsistency.\n\n“Your ZIP code is going to determine the protections you have,” Howard says.\n\nShe argues that lasting progress will require federal action, especially as proposed health care changes could leave millions more uninsured. “We shouldn’t be talking about a static problem,” Howard adds. “This problem is going to grow.”\n\nWhat comes next\n\nHospitals are watching closely. With potential Medicaid cuts on the horizon and more people at risk of losing coverage, unpaid care could rise again. The North Carolina Healthcare Association has warned that such pressures may make “sustaining these efforts more challenging.”\n\nStill, for millions of residents like Daly-Mack, the change has already landed with real impact. North Carolina’s approach offers a rare example of policy that looks backward with compassion and forward with prevention, proving that medical debt is not an inevitable part of getting sick.\n\nDid this solution stand out?

Because leukotrienes trigger a chain reaction that tightens the airways, drugs were developed to block their effects and ease breathing.\n\nNow, researchers at Case Western Reserve University say those molecules may not be the primary cause after all.\n\n\"We've found molecules that are alike in structure but generated through a completely different chemical pathway in the body,\" said lead researcher Robert Salomon, the Charles Frederic Mabery Professor of Research in Chemistry. \"We think the molecules we're calling 'pseudo leukotrienes,' may be the dominant players in the inflammatory cascade that causes disease.\"\n\nThe findings could lead to new approaches for treating asthma and other inflammatory conditions. Researchers say the work may also have implications for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and is available online as a pre-proof ahead of publication in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.\n\nHow Free Radicals Create a Different Kind of Inflammation\n\nLeukotrienes, long thought to be central to inflammatory diseases, are produced through enzyme-driven processes that modify lipids, or fatty molecules. The newly identified pseudo leukotrienes form in a very different way.\n\nSalomon and his team found that pseudo leukotrienes are created when free radicals add oxygen to lipids. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can cause damage if they are not controlled.\n\n\"The free radical process is almost like an explosion or a fire,\" said Salomon, who is also professor of ophthalmology in the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. \"It's just like when oxygen reacts with fuel and you get flames. It can easily get out of control.\"\n\nAccording to the researchers, people with asthma may have lower levels of enzymes and antioxidant molecules that normally neutralize free radicals before they cause harm.\n\nWhy Current Asthma Drugs May Miss the Target\n\nBoth leukotrienes and pseudo leukotrienes trigger inflammation by binding to the same receptor, much like a key turning an ignition to start an engine. Once activated, this process leads to airway constriction in people with asthma.\n\nMedications such as Singulair work by blocking that receptor, preventing the key from fitting and stopping the reaction from starting.\n\n\"The real importance of this discovery is the possibility of treating these diseases with drugs that prevent the free radical process or moderate it rather than drugs that block the receptor,\" Salomon said.\n\nThis approach could allow treatments to target harmful inflammation more precisely.\n\nWhen Inflammation Helps and When It Hurts\n\nInflammation is not always harmful. It plays a vital role in healing by directing white blood cells to injured tissue. It is also involved in memory and normal development.\n\nSome asthma drugs are currently being used off-label to treat neurological diseases. However, blocking leukotrienes may interfere with their beneficial roles in the body.\n\n\"If the molecules that are causing the problem are not the leukotrienes but these other molecules,\" Salomon said, \"a better treatment would be to just stop the formation of these other molecules rather than gumming up the ignition.\"\n\nTesting the Theory in Patients\n\nTo investigate their hypothesis, Salomon and his colleagues relied on decades of experience studying lipid oxidation, along with chemical insight, to predict that pseudo leukotrienes existed. They synthesized the molecules in the lab and developed techniques to detect them in biological samples.\n\nThe team analyzed urine samples from people with mild or severe asthma and compared them with samples from individuals without the disease.\n\nPseudo leukotrienes were not only present in asthma patients, but their levels closely matched disease severity. People with asthma, whether mild or severe, had four to five times higher levels than those without asthma. Researchers suggest these molecules could serve as a biomarker to measure disease severity and track how well treatments are working.\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\nThe research team plans to examine whether pseudo leukotrienes also play a role in other respiratory illnesses. These include respiratory syncytial virus (commonly known as RSV), bronchiolitis in babies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nThe study involved collaborators from multiple institutions. At Case Western Reserve University, the team included Mikhail Linetsky, research professor in chemistry, Masaru Miyagi, professor of pharmacology at the School of Medicine, and graduate students. Contributors from the University of Toledo included Sailaja Paruchuri, professor of physiology and pharmacology, and Lakshminarayan Teegala, assistant professor of physiology and pharmacology. At the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, Fariba Rezaee participated as associate professor of pediatrics and staff physician in the Center for Pulmonary Medicine.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Asthma is a lung disease that makes breathing hard because of inflammation in the airways. For many years, scientists believed certain molecules called leukotrienes caused this inflammation, and asthma medicines were designed to block them.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Case Western Reserve University found new molecules called \"pseudo leukotrienes\" that also cause inflammation but form through a different process involving free radicals. They tested urine samples and saw that people with asthma had much higher levels of these pseudo leukotrienes, which matched how bad their symptoms were.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery suggests that current asthma medicines might not be targeting the main cause of inflammation. Instead of blocking the effects of leukotrienes, new treatments could stop the free radical process that creates pseudo leukotrienes. This could lead to better, more precise asthma medicines and help with other diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will study if pseudo leukotrienes also affect other lung illnesses like RSV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They will also work on developing drugs that prevent these molecules from forming.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists discovered new molecules linked to asthma that could change how the disease is treated by targeting the cause, not just the symptoms.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’asthme est une maladie des poumons qui rend la respiration difficile à cause d’une inflammation des voies respiratoires. Pendant des années, les scientifiques ont pensé que des molécules appelées leucotriènes étaient responsables, et les médicaments pour l’asthme bloquaient ces molécules.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs de l’université Case Western Reserve ont découvert de nouvelles molécules, les \"pseudo leucotriènes\", qui causent aussi l’inflammation mais se forment d’une autre manière, liée aux radicaux libres. Ils ont analysé des échantillons d’urine et ont vu que les personnes asthmatiques avaient beaucoup plus de ces molécules, ce qui correspondait à la gravité de leurs symptômes.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte suggère que les médicaments actuels ne ciblent peut-être pas la vraie cause de l’inflammation. Plutôt que de bloquer les effets des leucotriènes, de nouveaux traitements pourraient empêcher la formation des pseudo leucotriènes. Cela pourrait améliorer les traitements de l’asthme et aider aussi pour des maladies comme Parkinson ou Alzheimer.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques vont étudier si ces molécules jouent un rôle dans d’autres maladies pulmonaires comme le VRS (virus respiratoire syncytial) et la bronchopneumopathie chronique obstructive.
