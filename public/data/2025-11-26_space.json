      "content": "Mosses are well known for surviving in places that challenge most life, including the Himalayan peaks, the scorching deserts of Death Valley, the Antarctic tundra, and the cooling surfaces of active volcanoes. Their remarkable durability led researchers to test moss sporophytes, the reproductive structures that hold spores, in an even harsher setting: outer space. According to a study published in the journal iScience on November 20, more than 80% of these spores endured 9 months outside the International Space Station (ISS) and returned to Earth still capable of reproduction. This marks the first evidence that an early land plant can survive long-term exposure to space conditions.\n\n\"Most living organisms, including humans, cannot survive even briefly in the vacuum of space,\" says lead author Tomomichi Fujita of Hokkaido University. \"However, the moss spores retained their vitality after nine months of direct exposure. This provides striking evidence that the life that has evolved on Earth possesses, at the cellular level, intrinsic mechanisms to endure the conditions of space.\"\n\nAsking Whether Moss Could Survive Beyond Earth\n\nFujita began exploring the possibility of \"space moss\" while studying plant evolution. He was impressed by mosses' ability to colonize the harshest environments on Earth. \"I began to wonder: could this small yet remarkably robust plant also survive in space?\"\n\nTo investigate, Fujita's team exposed Physcomitrium patens, also known as spreading earthmoss, to a simulated space environment featuring intense UV radiation, extremely high and low temperatures, and vacuum-like conditions.\n\nTesting Moss Structures Under Extreme Stress\n\nThe researchers compared three moss forms: protenemata (juvenile moss), brood cells (stress-induced stem cells), and sporophytes (encapsulated spores). They aimed to identify which structure had the greatest likelihood of enduring space.\n\n\"We anticipated that the combined stresses of space, including vacuum, cosmic radiation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and microgravity, would cause far greater damage than any single stress alone,\" says Fujita.\n\nTheir experiments showed that UV radiation posed the biggest threat, and sporophytes clearly outperformed the other structures. Juvenile moss did not survive strong UV exposure or extreme temperatures. Brood cells fared better but still fell short. By contrast, the encased spores showed ~1,000x greater UV tolerance and remained capable of germination even after enduring −196°C for more than a week or 55°C for an entire month.\n\nWhy Encased Spores Withstand Harsh Conditions\n\nThe team concluded that each spore's surrounding structure likely absorbs harmful UV light and provides physical and chemical shielding. They suggest that this protective feature may have helped ancient bryophytes, the plant group that includes mosses, move from water to land roughly 500 million years ago and survive repeated mass extinctions.\n\nTo determine whether this adaptation held up in real space, the researchers sent sporophytes into orbit.\n\nLaunching Moss to the ISS for a Real-World Trial\n\nIn March 2022, hundreds of sporophytes traveled to the ISS aboard the Cygnus NG-17 spacecraft. After their arrival, astronauts mounted the samples on the exterior of the station, exposing them to space for 283 days. The specimens later returned to Earth on SpaceX CRS-16 in January 2023 and were brought back to the lab for analysis.\n\n\"We expected almost zero survival, but the result was the opposite: most of the spores survived,\" says Fujita. \"We were genuinely astonished by the extraordinary durability of these tiny plant cells.\"\n\nStrong Survival and Healthy Return to Earth\n\nMore than 80% of the spores endured the full trip, and all but 11% of those survivors successfully germinated in the laboratory. Measurements of chlorophyll showed normal levels for nearly all pigments, except for a 20% drop in chlorophyll a, a light-sensitive compound. Despite this reduction, the spores remained healthy.\n\n\"This study demonstrates the astonishing resilience of life that originated on Earth,\" says Fujita.\n\nThe team also used their data to build a mathematical model estimating how long the spores might last in similar conditions. Their calculation suggested a potential survival span of up to 5,600 days, or about 15 years, although they stressed that more data is needed for a firm conclusion.\n\nImplications for Growing Life Beyond Earth\n\nThe researchers hope these findings support future studies on how extraterrestrial soils might sustain plant life and encourage efforts to use mosses in developing agricultural systems for off-world environments.\n\n\"Ultimately, we hope this work opens a new frontier toward constructing ecosystems in extraterrestrial environments such as the Moon and Mars,\" says Fujita. \"I hope that our moss research will serve as a starting point.\"\n\nThis work was supported by DX scholarship Hokkaido University, JSPS KAKENHI, and the Astrobiology Center of National Institutes of Natural Sciences.",

Information about the table may be found on the GLOBE Observer website.\n\nA group of elementary-aged students gather outside of Oldham County Public Library in La Grange, Kentucky, United States to look at clouds in the sky. “If anyone asks what you are doing, tell them, ‘I am a citizen scientist and I am helping NASA,’” Children’s Programming Librarian, Cheri Grinnell, tells the kids. Grinnell supports an afterschool program called Leopard Spot where she engages K-5 students in collecting environmental data with the GLOBE (Global Learning & Observations to Benefit the Environment) Program.\n\n“One little boy really got excited about that, and I heard him tell his mom he was working for NASA as they were leaving,” says Grinnell. That idea is reinforced when the program receives an email from NASA with satellite data that align with the cloud data the students submitted. “I forwarded the NASA satellite response to the after-school coordinator, and she read it to them. That really excited them because it was evidence this is the real deal.”\n\nThis experience is one the GLOBE Observer Team (part of the NASA Science Activation program's NASA Earth Science Education Collaborative, NESEC) hears often: GLOBE volunteers of all ages love getting an email from NASA that compares satellite data with their cloud observations. “Feedback from NASA is huge. It’s the hook,” says Tina Rogerson, the programmer at NASA Langley Research Center who manages the satellite comparison emails. “It ties NASA science into what they saw when they did the observation.”\n\nNow, volunteers will have more opportunities to receive a satellite comparison email from NASA. GLOBE recently announced that, in addition to sending emails about satellite data that align with the cloud observations made by learners, they will now also be sending emails that compare the GLOBE Observer Land Cover observations made by learners with satellite data. The new satellite comparison for land cover builds on the system used to create cloud comparisons at NASA Langley Research Center.\n\nWhen a volunteer receives the email, they will see a link for each observation they have submitted. The link will open a website with a satellite comparison table. Their observation is at the top, followed by a satellite-based assessment of the land cover at that location. The last row of the table shows the most recent Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images of the observation site. Rogerson pulls GLOBE land cover data from the public GLOBE database to generate and send the comparison tables on a weekly basis. While users may opt out of receiving these emails, most participants will be excited to review their data from the space perspective.\n\nThese new collocated land cover observations are expected to raise greater awareness of how NASA and its interagency partners observe our changing home planet from space in order to inform societal needs. They will help every GLOBE volunteer see how their observations of the land fit in with the wider space-based view and how they are participating in the process of science. Based on the response to cloud satellite emails, seeing that bigger, impactful perspective via the satellite comparison email is motivating. The hope is to encourage volunteers to continue being NASA citizen scientists, collecting Earth system observations for GLOBE’s long-term environmental record.\n\n“I’m excited that land cover is finally becoming part of the operational satellite comparison system,” says Rogerson. This means that GLOBE volunteers will routinely receive satellite data for both land cover and clouds. “We are bringing real science right into your world.”\n\nNESEC, led by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) and supported by NASA under cooperative agreement award number NNX16AE28A, is part of NASA’s Science Activation Portfolio.

      "content": "Unexplained gamma ray radiation coming from the edge of the Milky Way galaxy could be produced by self-annihilating dark matter particles – but the idea requires further investigation\n\nMysterious radiation from the outer part of the Milky Way could be a sign of dark matter Triff/Shutterstock\n\nAn unexplained glow that appears to emanate throughout the Milky Way’s outer regions could be our first hint of what dark matter is made of, but astronomers say it is too early to know for sure.\n\nDark matter is thought to make up 85 per cent of all mass in the universe, but physicists have never been able to detect the particles that constitute it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne leading candidate for dark matter is a ghostly object called a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). These hypothetical particles are fiendishly difficult to detect because they interact so rarely with regular matter, but theorists predict that they should occasionally self-annihilate, disappearing and producing a flash of high-energy radiation in the form of gamma rays.\n\nIf dark matter is distributed throughout our galaxy, as its gravitational pull suggests, and it is also made up of WIMPs, then we should see a glow from the WIMPs self-annihilating. Astronomers have argued for more than a decade over whether a strange excess of gamma ray radiation from the centre of our galaxy could be this signal, but the evidence is still inconclusive.\n\nNow, Tomonori Totani at the University of Tokyo claims he may have detected such a signal coming from the outer part of the Milky Way, known as its halo, using 15 years of observations from NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Lost in Space-Time Untangle mind-bending physics, maths and the weirdness of reality with our monthly, special-guest-written newsletter. Sign up to newsletter\n\nTotani first produced a model of how much gamma ray radiation there should be in this region based on known sources, such as stars, cosmic rays and large bubbles of radiation seen above and below the Milky Way. Then, he subtracted this radiation from the amount seen by the Fermi telescope, finding there was a leftover gamma ray glow with an energy of around 20 gigaelectron volts.\n\nA gamma ray signal with this energy fits what could come from a particle self-annihilating in the energy range that WIMPs are predicted to have, says Totani. While he admits that it is too early to definitively conclude that the gamma ray spike is coming from dark matter, he says that the signal is “the most promising candidate radiation from dark matter known to date”.\n\n“Even though the research began with the aim of detecting dark matter signals, I thought it was like playing the lottery. So when I first spotted what seemed like a signal, I was sceptical,” says Totoni. “But when I took the time to check it meticulously and felt confident it was correct, I got goosebumps.”\n\n“It’s a result that certainly deserves further study, but drawing firm conclusions now would be premature,” says Francesca Calore at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Annecy. It is difficult to accurately make a model of all gamma ray sources in the Milky Way other than dark matter, she says, and Totoni didn’t thoroughly stress test the models.\n\nSilvia Manconi at Sorbonne University in France agrees that the results haven’t been exhaustively tested and we would need more sophisticated models to truly say whether the signal is real. Also, we haven’t seen such gamma ray signals from other sources where we should have, such as dwarf galaxies, she says, so that discrepancy would need to be explained.\n\nWe would need to look at many other radiation sources, such as radio waves and neutrinos, to be sure that the gamma rays aren’t coming from something else, says Anthony Brown at the University of Durham, UK. “It is only looking from one angle,” he says. “Dark matter really needs as much high-quality data as you can get.”",

Three years later, the spacecraft detected a signal from the area to the right of the ice cap that scientists interpreted as an underground lake. ESA/DLR/FU Berlin, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n\nResults from an enhanced radar technique have demonstrated improvement to sub-surface observations of Mars.\n\nNASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has revisited and raised new questions about a mysterious feature buried beneath thousands of feet of ice at the Red Planet’s south pole. In a recent study, researchers conclude from data obtained using an innovative radar technique that an area on Mars suspected of being an underground lake is more likely to be a layer of rock and dust.\n\nThe 2018 discovery of the suspected lake set off a flurry of scientific activity, as water is closely linked with life in the solar system. While the latest findings indicate this feature is not a lake below the Martian surface, it does suggest that the same radar technique could be used to check for subsurface resources elsewhere on Mars, supporting future explorers.\n\nThe paper, published in Geophysical Research Letters on Nov. 17, was led by two of MRO’s Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument scientists, Gareth Morgan and Than Putzig, who are based at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and Lakewood, Colorado, respectively.\n\nThe observations were made by MRO with a special maneuver that rolls the spacecraft 120 degrees. Doing so enhances the power of SHARAD, enabling the radar’s signal to penetrate deeper underground and provide a clearer image of the subsurface. These “very large rolls” have proved so effective that scientists are eager to use them at previously observed sites where buried ice might exist.\n\nThis map shows the approximate area where in 2018 ESA’s Mars Express detected a signal the mission’s scientists interpreted as an underground lake. The red lines show the path of NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which flew both directly overhead as well as over an adjacent region.\n\nCredit: Planetary Science Institute\n\nMorgan, Putzig, and fellow SHARAD team members had made multiple unsuccessful attempts to observe the area suspected of hosting a buried lake. Then the scientists partnered with the spacecraft’s operations team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which leads the mission, to develop the very large roll capability.\n\nBecause the radar’s antenna is at the back of MRO, the orbiter’s body obstructs its view and weakens the instrument’s sensitivity. After considerable work, engineers at JPL and Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, which built the spacecraft and supports its operations, developed commands for a 120-degree roll — a technique that requires careful planning to keep the spacecraft safe — to direct more of SHARAD’s signal at the surface.\n\nBright signal\n\nOn May 26, SHARAD performed a very large roll to finally pick up the signal in the target area, which spans about 12.5 miles (20 kilometers) and is buried under a slab of water ice almost 1 mile (1,500 meters) thick.\n\nWhen a radar signal bounces off underground layers, the strength of its reflection depends on what the subsurface is made of. Most materials let the signal slip through or absorb it, making the return faint. Liquid water is special in that it produces a very reflective surface, sending back a very strong signal (imagine pointing a flashlight at a mirror).\n\nThat’s the kind of signal that was spotted from this area in 2018 by a team working with the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) instrument aboard the ESA (European Space Agency) Mars Express orbiter. To explain how such a body of water could remain liquid under all that ice, scientists have hypothesized it could be a briny lake, since high salt content can lower water’s freezing temperature.\n\nAn antenna sticks out like whiskers from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in this artist’s concept depicting the spacecraft, which has been orbiting the Red Planet since 2006. This antenna is part of SHARAD, a radar that peers below the Martian surface. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n“We’ve been observing this area with SHARAD for almost 20 years without seeing anything from those depths,” said Putzig. But once MRO achieved a very large roll over the precise area, the team was able to look much deeper. And rather than the bright signal MARSIS received, SHARAD detected a faint one. A different very-large-roll observation of an adjacent area didn’t detect a signal at all, suggesting something unique is causing a quirky radar signal at the exact spot MARSIS saw a signal.\n\n“The lake hypothesis generated lots of creative work, which is exactly what exciting scientific discoveries are supposed to do,” said Morgan. “And while this new data won’t settle the debate, it makes it very hard to support the idea of a liquid water lake.”\n\nAlternative explanations\n\nMars’ south pole has an ice cap sitting atop heavily cratered terrain, and most radar images of the area below the ice show lots of peaks and valleys. Morgan and Putzig said it’s possible that the bright signal MARSIS detected here may just be a rare smooth area — an ancient lava flow, for example.\n\nBoth scientists are excited to use the very large roll technique to reexamine other scientifically interesting regions of Mars. One such place is Medusae Fossae, a sprawling geologic formation on Mars’ equator that produces little radar return. While some scientists have suggested it’s composed of layers of volcanic ash, others have suggested the layers may include heaps of ice deep within.\n\n“If it’s ice, that means there’s lots of water resources near the Martian equator, where you’d want to send humans,” said Putzig. “Because the equator is exposed to more sunlight, it’s warmer and ideal for astronauts to live and work.”\n\nMore about MRO\n\nNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California manages MRO for the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington as part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program portfolio. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built MRO and supports its operations. SHARAD was provided to the MRO mission by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).\n\nNews Media Contacts\n\nAndrew Good\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n\n818-393-2433\n\nandrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\n\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n\n202-358-1600\n\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov\n\n2025-130",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long wondered if there is liquid water hidden beneath the thick ice at Mars’ south pole. In 2018, a European spacecraft detected signals that made researchers think there might be an underground lake there.\n\n**What happened** – NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) used a new radar technique that involves rolling the spacecraft 120 degrees to get a better view beneath the ice. This helped researchers see deeper underground than before. Instead of finding a lake, they discovered that the area is likely made of rock and dust covered by ice.\n\n**Impact** – This finding changes what scientists thought about the south pole’s underground. It shows that the bright radar signals seen before might come from smooth rock layers, not liquid water. The new radar method also works better at looking under the surface, which can help find ice or other materials in other parts of Mars.\n\n**What’s next step** – Scientists plan to use this radar technique to study other places on Mars, such as a large area near the equator that might hold hidden ice. Finding ice closer to the equator is important because it could be easier for future astronauts to use.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – NASA’s improved radar technique has clarified that a suspected underground lake on Mars is actually frozen rock and dust, opening new ways to explore the planet’s hidden resources.",
