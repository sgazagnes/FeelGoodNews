      "title": "Scientists discover hidden brain cells that help heal spinal cord injuries",
      "summary": "Scientists at Cedars-Sinai have uncovered a surprising repair system in the spinal cord that could open new doors for treating paralysis, stroke, and diseases like multiple sclerosis. They found that special support cells called astrocytes—located far from the actual injury—spring into action after damage. These “lesion-remote astrocytes” send out a protein signal, CCN1, that reprograms immune cells to efficiently clean up fatty nerve debris.",
      "content": "Researchers at Cedars-Sinai have identified a biological repair process that could eventually lead to new treatments for spinal cord injuries, stroke, and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The findings, published in Nature, reveal an unexpected role for astrocytes, a major support cell in the central nervous system.\n\n\"Astrocytes are critical responders to disease and disorders of the central nervous system -- the brain and spinal cord,\" said neuroscientist Joshua Burda, PhD, assistant professor of Biomedical Sciences and Neurology at Cedars-Sinai and senior author of the study. \"We discovered that astrocytes far from the site of an injury actually help drive spinal cord repair. Our research also uncovered a mechanism used by these unique astrocytes to signal the immune system to clean up debris resulting from the injury, which is a critical step in the tissue-healing process.\"\n\nThe team named these cells \"lesion-remote astrocytes,\" or LRAs. They also identified several distinct subtypes. For the first time, the study explains how one subtype can detect damage from a distance and respond in ways that support recovery.\n\nHow the Spinal Cord Responds to Injury\n\nThe spinal cord is a long bundle of nerve tissue that extends from the brain down the back. Its inner region, called gray matter, contains nerve cell bodies along with astrocytes. Surrounding that is white matter, made up of astrocytes and long nerve fibers that carry signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Astrocytes help maintain a stable environment so these signals can travel properly.\n\nWhen the spinal cord is injured, nerve fibers are torn apart. This can cause paralysis and disrupt sensations such as touch and temperature. The damaged fibers break down into debris. In most tissues, inflammation remains confined to the injured area. In the spinal cord, however, nerve fibers can span long distances, so damage and inflammation can spread well beyond the original injury site.\n\nLesion-Remote Astrocytes and Immune Cleanup\n\nIn experiments involving mice with spinal cord injuries, researchers found that LRAs play a key role in promoting repair. They also found strong signs that the same process occurs in spinal cord tissue from human patients.\n\nOne LRA subtype produces a protein called CCN1. This molecule sends signals to immune cells known as microglia.\n\n\"One function of microglia is to serve as chief garbage collectors in the central nervous system,\" Burda said. \"After tissue damage, they eat up pieces of nerve fiber debris -- which are very fatty and can cause them to get a kind of indigestion. Our experiments showed that astrocyte CCN1 signals the microglia to change their metabolism so they can better digest all that fat.\"\n\nAccording to Burda, this improved debris removal may help explain why some patients experience partial, spontaneous recovery after spinal cord injury. When researchers eliminated astrocyte-derived CCN1, healing was significantly reduced.\n\n\"If we remove astrocyte CCN1, the microglia eat, but they don't digest. They call in more microglia, which also eat but don't digest,\" Burda said. \"Big clusters of debris-filled microglia form, heightening inflammation up and down the spinal cord. And when that happens, the tissue doesn't repair as well.\"\n\nImplications for Multiple Sclerosis and Brain Injury\n\nWhen scientists examined spinal cord samples from people with multiple sclerosis, they observed the same CCN1-related repair process. Burda noted that these basic repair principles may apply broadly to injuries affecting either the brain or spinal cord.\n\n\"The role of astrocytes in central nervous system healing is remarkably understudied,\" said David Underhill, PhD, chair of the Department of Biomedical Sciences. \"This work strongly suggests that lesion-remote astrocytes offer a viable path for limiting chronic inflammation, enhancing functionally meaningful regeneration, and promoting neurological recovery after brain and spinal cord injury and in disease.\"\n\nBurda is now working to develop strategies that harness the CCN1 pathway to improve spinal cord healing. His team is also studying how astrocyte CCN1 may influence inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases and aging.\n\nAdditional Cedars-Sinai authors include Sarah McCallum, Keshav B. Suresh, Timothy S. Islam, Manish K. Tripathi, Ann W. Saustad, Oksana Shelest, Aditya Patil, David Lee, Brandon Kwon, Katherine Leitholf, Inga Yenokian, Sophia E. Shaka, Jasmine Plummer, Vinicius F.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long studied how the spinal cord repairs itself after injury. The spinal cord connects the brain to the body and is vital for movement and feeling. Damage to it can cause paralysis and other serious problems.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Cedars-Sinai discovered that special brain support cells called astrocytes, located far from the injury site, help repair damaged spinal cords. These cells, named lesion-remote astrocytes (LRAs), send out a protein called CCN1. This protein tells immune cells called microglia to clean up fatty debris from damaged nerve fibers more effectively. The study was done with mice and also confirmed in human spinal cord samples.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it reveals a new way the body helps heal after spinal cord injuries. Better cleanup of nerve debris by microglia prevents harmful inflammation and supports tissue repair. It also helps explain why some people recover partially after injury. The same process was seen in multiple sclerosis, a disease that damages the nervous system, showing the findings may apply to other brain and spinal cord conditions.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists are now working on ways to use the CCN1 protein to improve healing after spinal cord injuries and possibly treat other diseases like multiple sclerosis. They hope this could lead to new therapies that reduce inflammation and help the nervous system recover better.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists found that special brain cells far from an injury help clean up damaged nerves, opening new paths to treat spinal cord injuries and neurological diseases.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nLife expectancy in the United States climbed to a historic high in 2024, reaching 79 years—its highest level ever recorded. The gains reflect a hopeful turnaround after years of decline driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and rising drug overdose deaths. Early data suggests that 2025 may bring even more improvement.\n\n“It’s pretty much good news all the way around,” said Robert Anderson of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which released the updated figures last month.\n\nThe milestone not only marks a recovery from the pandemic-era dip in mortality but also highlights progress in tackling some of the country’s leading causes of death, including heart disease, cancer, and opioid overdoses.\n\nWhat does life expectancy really mean?\n\nLife expectancy is more than a number. It’s a core indicator of a nation’s overall health. The figure represents the average number of years a baby born in a specific year is expected to live, assuming current death rates stay the same.\n\nFor decades, life expectancy in the US trended steadily upward, aided by medical advances, improved access to care, and public health efforts. It peaked just under 79 years in 2014, then plateaued for several years before taking a sharp downturn with the arrival of COVID-19.\n\nIn 2021, the worst year of the pandemic in terms of mortality, life expectancy in the US fell to just under 76 and a half years. More than 1.2 million Americans died of COVID-19 overall, and the toll pushed the country’s life expectancy to its lowest point in 25 years. The rebound since then has been striking.\n\nFewer deaths across the board\n\nRoughly 3.07 million Americans died in 2024, showing a decrease of around 18,000 from the year before. That drop is significant, especially when considering the population’s aging demographics.\n\nDeath rates declined across racial and ethnic groups, and in both men and women. COVID-19, once the third-leading cause of death in the US, fell out of the top ten. In its place, suicide entered the top ten causes, though it’s worth noting that suicide rates actually declined slightly in 2024, according to the NCHS report. Homicides also decreased.\n\nHeart disease remains the number one cause of death in the US, but its mortality rate dropped for the second consecutive year, sitting at about three percent in 2024. Dr. Sadiya Khan, a cardiologist and researcher at Northwestern University, credits this to a mix of factors, including better treatments, wider adoption of weight management strategies, and earlier detection of cardiovascular risk.\n\nCancer also saw modest declines in death rates, continuing a positive trend driven by better screening, treatment, and declining smoking rates.\n\nOpioid-related deaths show hopeful signs\n\nPerhaps most notable is the apparent shift in the long-running drug overdose crisis. Andrew Stokes, a public health researcher at Boston University, pointed out that 2024’s gains reflect not only pandemic recovery but a “lasting improvement” in overdose-related mortality.\n\nAfter years of escalating fatalities tied to synthetic opioids like fentanyl, the data now suggest a plateau, and in some areas, a decline. That’s encouraging news, though experts caution that the crisis is far from over.\n\nHow 2025 is shaping up\n\nThe death statistics for 2025 are not yet finalized, but early numbers are promising. Around 3.05 million deaths were recorded last year, and while that total will likely rise slightly as reporting is completed, officials say they expect another improvement in life expectancy.\n\nIf confirmed, it would mean the US is continuing to reverse the mortality trends that defined much of the last decade.\n\nStill, experts note that while 79 years is a milestone, the US continues to lag behind many other high-income nations in overall life expectancy. Countries like Japan, Switzerland, and Australia routinely exceed 82 years.\n\n“There’s a lot more to be done,” said Stokes. “But the direction we’re heading in is encouraging.”\n\nA moment of momentum and a chance to do more\n\nThe rise in life expectancy is a rare piece of unambiguous good news in public health. It reflects both individual behavior changes, such as reduced smoking and improved diet, and systemic shifts, including greater awareness of mental health and substance use.\n\nTo keep the momentum going, experts emphasize continued investment in preventive care, equitable access to treatment, and targeted public health efforts to address the social determinants of health.\n\nAs Anderson noted, while final data for 2025 is still pending, the progress so far gives reason to believe the upward trend may continue. After years of backsliding, Americans may finally be living longer and healthier lives.\n\nDid this solution stand out? Share it with a friend or support our mission by becoming an Emissary.",

In a VR study, researchers found that AI-powered prosthetic arms were best accepted when they moved at a natural, human-like speed—about one second per reach. That sweet spot boosted feelings of control, comfort, and even trust in the robot.",
      "content": "As artificial intelligence powered prosthetic arms become more common, understanding how people respond to them will be essential. Acceptance depends not only on how well these devices function, but also on how natural they feel.

They then tested how different movement speeds influenced embodiment, including body ownership, sense of agency, usability, and social impressions such as competence and discomfort.\n\nThe findings showed a clear pattern. When the prosthetic arm moved too quickly or too slowly, participants felt less connected to it and rated it as less usable. However, when the arm moved at a moderate pace similar to natural human reaching, taking about one second to complete the motion, participants reported the strongest sense that the arm felt like part of their own body.\n\nFrom User Controlled Prosthetics to Autonomous AI\n\nFor individuals who lose a hand or arm, prosthetic limbs are critical tools for daily life. Much of the research in this field has focused on helping devices respond accurately to a user's intentions. This often involves detecting biosignals such as electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) and translating them into movement.\n\nAt the same time, rapid progress in machine learning and AI is making it possible for future prosthetics to assist users by moving on their own in certain situations. These autonomous or semi autonomous systems could anticipate needs and provide support automatically. Yet when a limb begins moving independently, it can feel \"unsettling\" or \"not part of my body.\" That reaction presents a major challenge for widespread adoption.\n\nVirtual Reality Study Tests Speed and Embodiment\n\nEarlier research suggests that people are more comfortable with autonomous movement when they understand the goal behind it. Building on this idea, Harin Manujaya Hapuarachchi and colleagues (Hapuarachchi was a doctoral student at the time of the study and is now an Assistant Professor in the School of Informatics at Kochi University of Technology) explored whether movement speed plays a role in acceptance.\n\nIn a virtual reality environment, participants saw an avatar whose left forearm had been replaced with a prosthetic limb. They were asked to complete a reaching task while the virtual prosthetic arm moved on its own toward a target. The researchers adjusted the duration of each movement across six different speeds (125 ms to 4 s). After each trial, participants evaluated how much the arm felt like their own, how much control they felt, how usable it seemed (SUS), and their impressions of the robot using a standardized scale (RoSAS: competence, warmth, and discomfort).\n\nThe One Second Sweet Spot\n\nThe results were consistent and striking:\n\nAt a moderate speed (movement duration of 1 s), ratings of body ownership, sense of agency, and usability were highest.\n\nIn the fastest (125 ms) and slowest (4 s) conditions, those ratings dropped significantly.\n\nParticipants viewed the arm as more competent at moderate to slightly faster speeds, while discomfort peaked in the fastest condition. Perceived warmth did not clearly depend on speed.\n\nIn short, simply making a prosthetic arm faster does not make it better. Matching the timing of natural human movement appears to be far more important for helping users feel that the device truly belongs to them.\n\nDesigning Human Like Robotic Body Augmentation\n\nThese insights suggest that future AI enabled prostheses should prioritize human compatible timing rather than speed alone. Designers may need to tune movement patterns so they align with what the brain expects from a natural limb.\n\nThe implications extend beyond prosthetic arms. Other technologies that function as extensions of the body, including supernumerary robotic limbs, exoskeletons, and wearable robots, could also benefit from movement that mirrors natural human rhythm.\n\nResearchers also plan to explore how long term use changes perception. People often begin to experience frequently used tools as if they were part of their body. With continued daily use, even a fast and highly capable robotic limb may start to feel \"normal,\" easier to operate, and more fully embodied.\n\nVirtual reality plays a key role in this research. It allows scientists to test emerging prosthetic technologies and control systems in a safe and controlled setting before they are widely available. This approach makes it possible to evaluate psychological responses, user acceptance, and design considerations early in development.\n\nThis research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (JP22KK0158), the Murata Science and Education Foundation, JST (JPMJFS121), and MEXT (202334Z302).",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to create robotic prosthetic arms for people who have lost a hand or arm. These devices can either be controlled by the user or move on their own using AI. However, if the robotic arm moves too fast or too slow, it can feel strange or uncomfortable to the user.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers conducted a study using virtual reality (VR) to test how the speed of a prosthetic arm’s movement affects how natural it feels. Participants saw a virtual arm replacing their own and watched it reach for targets at different speeds, ranging from very fast (125 milliseconds) to very slow (4 seconds). The study found that when the arm moved at about one second per reach—a speed similar to a real human arm—participants felt the strongest connection and control over the arm.\n\n**Impact** – This finding is important because it shows that matching the speed of natural human movement helps users accept and trust AI-powered prosthetic arms. Moving too quickly or slowly made the arm feel less like part of the body and less easy to use. This research can help designers build better prosthetics and other wearable robots that feel more natural, improving everyday life for people who rely on these devices.\n\n**What’s next step** – Researchers want to study how long-term use changes how people feel about robotic limbs. They also plan to explore how to design movement patterns that fit the brain’s expectations better. Virtual reality will continue to be used to test new prosthetic technology safely before it reaches users.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Prosthetic arms that move at a natural speed of about one second per reach feel more like a real part of the body and are easier for users to accept and control.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’intelligence artificielle (IA) est utilisée pour créer des bras prothétiques robotiques pour les personnes ayant perdu une main ou un bras. Ces appareils peuvent être contrôlés par l’utilisateur ou bouger seuls grâce à l’IA. Mais si le bras robotique bouge trop vite ou trop lentement, cela peut sembler étrange ou inconfortable.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs ont mené une étude en réalité virtuelle (VR) pour tester comment la vitesse de mouvement d’un bras prothétique influence la sensation de naturel. Les participants voyaient un bras virtuel à la place du leur et le voyaient atteindre des cibles à différentes vitesses, allant de très rapide (125 millisecondes) à très lent (4 secondes). L’étude a montré que lorsque le bras bougeait en environ une seconde par mouvement—une vitesse proche d’un bras humain réel—les participants ressentaient le plus fort lien et contrôle.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte est importante car elle montre qu’adapter la vitesse au mouvement naturel humain aide les utilisateurs à accepter et faire confiance aux bras prothétiques IA. Un mouvement trop rapide ou trop lent donnait l’impression que le bras n’était pas vraiment une partie du corps et était moins facile à utiliser. Cette recherche peut aider à concevoir de meilleures prothèses et autres robots portables plus naturels, améliorant la vie quotidienne de leurs utilisateurs.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs veulent étudier comment l’utilisation à long terme change la perception des membres robotiques. Ils prévoient aussi d’explorer comment créer des mouvements qui correspondent mieux aux attentes du cerveau. La réalité virtuelle continuera d’être utilisée pour tester ces technologies en toute sécurité avant leur mise à disposition.\n\n**Phrase clé** – Un bras prothétique qui bouge à une vitesse naturelle d’environ une seconde par mouvement est perçu comme une vraie partie du corps et est plus facile à contrôler et accepter.",
