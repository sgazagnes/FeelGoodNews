      "title": "Scientists found a sugar that could defeat deadly superbugs",
      "summary": "Scientists in Australia have uncovered a clever new way to fight some of the most dangerous drug-resistant bacteria by targeting a sugar that exists only on bacterial cells. By designing antibodies that recognize this unique sugar, researchers were able to guide the immune system to attack and eliminate deadly infections that normally shrug off antibiotics.",
      "content": "Researchers in Australia have developed a promising new strategy to combat deadly bacteria that no longer respond to antibiotics. The team engineered antibodies that lock onto a sugar found only on bacterial cells, an approach that could support a new generation of immunotherapies for multidrug resistant infections acquired in hospitals.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Chemical Biology, shows that an antibody created in the laboratory was able to eliminate a normally fatal bacterial infection in mice. It works by binding to a distinctive bacterial sugar and alerting the immune system to destroy the invading pathogen.\n\nThe project was co led by Professor Richard Payne of the University of Sydney, working with Professor Ethan Goddard Borger at WEHI and Associate Professor Nichollas Scott from the University of Melbourne and the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity.\n\nProfessor Payne is also set to lead the newly announced Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Advanced Peptide and Protein Engineering. This center will build on discoveries like this one to speed the transition from basic research to applications in biotechnology, agriculture, and conservation.\n\n\"This study shows what's possible when we combine chemical synthesis with biochemistry, immunology, microbiology and infection biology,\" Professor Payne said. \"By precisely building these bacterial sugars in the lab with synthetic chemistry, we were able to understand their shape at the molecular level and develop antibodies that bind them with high specificity. That opens the door to new ways of treating some devastating drug-resistant bacterial infections.\"\n\nWhy a Bacterial Sugar Is a Unique Target\n\nThe antibody developed by the team targets a sugar molecule called pseudaminic acid. Although it resembles sugars found on human cells, this molecule is made only by bacteria. Many dangerous pathogens use it as a key part of their outer surface, helping them survive and evade immune defenses.\n\nBecause the human body does not produce this sugar, it offers a highly specific target for developing immunotherapies that avoid harming healthy cells.\n\nDesigning a Broad Acting Antibody\n\nTo take advantage of this weakness, the researchers first synthesized the bacterial sugar and sugar decorated peptides entirely from scratch. This work allowed them to determine the molecule's exact three dimensional structure and how it appears on bacterial surfaces.\n\nUsing this detailed information, the team created what they describe as a \"pan-specific\" antibody. It can recognize the same sugar across many different bacterial species and strains.\n\nIn mouse infection studies, the antibody successfully cleared multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. This bacterium is a well known cause of hospital acquired pneumonia and bloodstream infections and is especially difficult to treat.\n\n\"Multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical threat faced in modern healthcare facilities across the globe,\" Professor Goddard-Borger said. \"It is not uncommon for infections to resist even last-line antibiotics. Our work serves as a powerful proof-of-concept experiment that opens the door to the development of new life-saving passive immunotherapies.\"\n\nHow Passive Immunotherapy Could Protect Patients\n\nPassive immunotherapy involves giving patients ready made antibodies to quickly control an infection, rather than waiting for the body's adaptive immune system to respond. This approach can be used both to treat active infections and to prevent them.\n\nIn hospital settings, it could be used to protect vulnerable patients in intensive care units who are at high risk from drug resistant bacteria.\n\nAssociate Professor Scott noted that the antibodies also offer an important new way to study how bacteria cause disease.\n\n\"These sugars are central to bacterial virulence, but they've been very hard to study,\" he said. \"Having antibodies that can selectively recognise them lets us map where they appear and how they change across different pathogens. That knowledge feeds directly into better diagnostics and therapies.\"\n\nMoving Toward Clinical Use\n\nOver the next five years, the team plans to turn these findings into antibody treatments ready for use in the clinic, with a focus on multidrug resistant A. baumannii. Achieving this goal would remove one of the most dangerous members of the ESKAPE pathogens and mark a significant step forward in the global effort to fight antimicrobial resistance.\n\n\"This is exactly the kind of breakthrough the new ARC Centre of Excellence is designed to enable,\" Professor Payne said. \"Our goal is to turn fundamental molecular insight into real-world solutions that protect the most vulnerable people in our healthcare system.\"\n\nThe authors declare no competing interests.

By blocking it, they stopped weight gain, reduced liver damage, and lowered harmful cholesterol levels in animal studies. The finding opens the door to a new kind of medication that could tackle obesity, fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease all at once.",
      "content": "Scientists at Cleveland-based institutions have uncovered a surprising new switch that helps the body make fat -- and turning it off had dramatic effects.\n\nObesity and fatty liver disease are becoming more common worldwide as diets grow more calorie-dense and daily life becomes less active.\n\nScientists in Cleveland have identified a previously unknown enzyme that the body needs in order to make fat.\n\nWhen researchers blocked this enzyme, it stopped weight gain and reduced unhealthy cholesterol levels.\n\nThe discovery is now driving development of a potential three-in-one drug aimed at obesity, fatty liver disease, and heart disease.\n\nObesity and Fatty Liver Disease Are Rising Worldwide\n\nObesity has become a global health crisis and a leading contributor to illness and early death. It raises the risk of serious conditions such as heart disease and fatty liver disease (MASLD). As diets have shifted toward calorie-dense foods and daily life has become more sedentary, rates of these disorders have climbed steadily around the world.\n\nNitric oxide is a gas produced naturally in the body that influences many biological processes. It works by attaching to proteins and changing how they function. Maintaining the right balance is critical. When nitric oxide binds too much or too little to certain key proteins, it can contribute to disease.\n\nScientists Identify an Enzyme That Triggers Fat Production\n\nIn a new study published in Science Signaling, researchers from University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University identified a previously unknown enzyme called SCoR2. This enzyme removes nitric oxide from proteins that regulate fat buildup. When nitric oxide was removed, fat production switched on, showing that SCoR2 is essential for making fat.\n\nBlocking the Enzyme Prevented Weight Gain in Mice\n\nThe research team then tested what happens when SCoR2 is blocked. They did this both through genetic methods and by developing a drug designed to inhibit the enzyme. In mouse models, shutting down SCoR2 stopped weight gain and protected the liver from injury. The treatment also reduced levels of bad cholesterol.\n\n\"We have a new class of drug that prevents weight gain and lowers cholesterol -- a potential therapy for obesity and cardiovascular disease, with additional hepatic benefits,\" explained lead author of the study, Jonathan Stamler, MD, President and Co-Founder, Harrington Discovery Institute, Distinguished University Professor, Robert S. and Sylvia K. Reitman Family Foundation Professor of Cardiovascular Innovation, and Professor of Medicine and of Biochemistry at University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University.\n\nHow Nitric Oxide Regulates Fat and Cholesterol\n\nDr. Stamler said nitric oxide acts as a natural brake on fat production in different tissues. \"In the liver, nitric oxide inhibits the proteins that make fat and cholesterol. In fat tissue, nitric oxide inhibits the genetic program that makes the enzymes that create fat,\" he said.\n\nResearchers now plan to move the drug toward clinical testing in people. That process is expected to take about 18 months.\n\n\"Our team looks forward to further developing a first-in-class drug to block weight gain and lower cholesterol, with favorable effects on liver health,\" Dr. Stamler said.\n\nDrug Development Support and Broader Impact\n\nThe drug will be advanced with support from the Harrington Discovery Institute at UH, an organization focused on turning promising scientific findings into treatments for unmet medical needs. Now in its 13th year, the institute's expanding portfolio includes 227 medicines in development; 75 institutions supported; 46 companies launched; 24 medicines currently in clinical trials; and 15 licenses to pharmaceutical companies.",

Developed by researchers at Caltech and USC, the system delivers detailed results quickly and without radiation or contrast dyes. It has already been used to image multiple parts of the human body. The approach could significantly improve cancer detection, nerve-damage monitoring, and brain imaging.",
      "content": "Researchers at Caltech and USC have created a new medical imaging approach that quickly produces 3D color images showing both the physical structure of soft tissue and how blood vessels are working. The technique has already been used to image several parts of the human body. Scientists say it could lead to better breast cancer imaging, improved tracking of nerve damage linked to diabetes, and new ways to study the brain.\n\nDetails of the work were published in Nature Biomedical Engineering.\n\nWhy Existing Imaging Tools Fall Short\n\nStandard ultrasound is fast, affordable, and widely used, but it mainly shows tissue shape in two dimensions and offers a limited viewing area. Photoacoustic imaging provides a different kind of information. It works by sending laser light into the body and detecting the sound waves produced when certain molecules absorb that light. This allows doctors and researchers to see blood vessels in optical color and observe blood flow through arteries and veins. However, photoacoustic imaging does not capture detailed tissue structure well.\n\nOther common imaging methods, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), come with tradeoffs. These techniques may require contrast agents, expose patients to ionizing radiation, cost more, or take too long to use frequently.\n\nCombining Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Imaging\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the research team developed RUS-PAT (rotational ultrasound tomography, RUST, combined with photoacoustic tomography, PAT). Photoacoustic tomography was first developed more than two decades ago by Lihong Wang, the Bren Professor of Medical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Medical Engineering Leadership Chair at Caltech. In PAT, tissue molecules that absorb light vibrate after being hit by short laser pulses, producing acoustic signals that can be measured and converted into detailed images.\n\nWang, who also serves as Caltech's executive officer for medical engineering, said the goal of the new project was to merge the strengths of ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. \"But it's not like one plus one,\" he explains. \"We needed to find an optimal way of combining the two technologies.\"\n\nA Simpler and More Practical Design\n\nTraditional ultrasound systems rely on many transducers to send and receive sound waves, making direct integration with photoacoustic imaging too complicated and costly for broad use. Photoacoustic imaging, by contrast, only needs ultrasound detection. This difference led Wang to a new idea. \"I thought, 'Wait, can we just mimic light excitation of ultrasound waves in photoacoustic tomography, but do it ultrasonically?'\"\n\nIn photoacoustic imaging, laser light spreads through tissue and triggers ultrasound waves that can be measured. Wang realized that a single wide-field ultrasound transducer could instead send sound waves throughout the tissue. The same detectors could then capture signals from both imaging methods.\n\nThe final system uses a small number of arc-shaped detectors that rotate around a central point. This setup effectively functions like a full hemispheric detector, while remaining far simpler and less expensive.\n\nDemonstrated Potential for Human Use\n\n\"The novel combination of acoustic and photoacoustic techniques addresses many of the key limitations of widely used medical-imaging techniques in current clinical practice, and, importantly, the feasibility for human application has been demonstrated here in multiple contexts,\" says Dr. Charles Y. Liu, a co-author of the study and a visiting associate in biology and biological engineering at Caltech. Liu is also a professor at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, director of USC's Neurorestoration Center, and chair of neurosurgery at the Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center.\n\nBecause the method can be used anywhere light can reach, RUS-PAT may have wide clinical applications. In breast cancer imaging, it could help doctors pinpoint a tumor's location while also revealing information about its biological activity. For patients with diabetic neuropathy, the technique could allow physicians to monitor both nerve structure and oxygen supply in a single scan. Wang also notes its potential for brain research, where scientists could study brain anatomy while simultaneously observing blood flow dynamics.\n\nSpeed, Depth, and Early Testing\n\nAt present, the system can image tissue up to about 4 centimeters deep. Light can also be delivered using endoscopic tools, which may allow access to deeper areas of the body. Each RUS-PAT scan takes less than one minute.\n\nThe current setup places ultrasound transducers and a laser beneath a scanning bed. The system has already been tested on human volunteers and patients and is now in the early stages of moving toward clinical use.\n\nStudy Details and Funding\n\nThe paper is titled \"Rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography of the human body.\" The co-lead authors are Yang Zhang, Shuai Na, and Dr. Jonathan J. Russin. Zhang and Na conducted the work as postdoctoral researchers at Caltech and are now based at Tsinghua University and Peking University in Beijing, respectively.

But are they useful in real-world settings, which have too few physicians to check the answers, as well as long patient lists and limited resources?\n\nTwo studies published in Nature Health on 6 February suggest that they are up to the task. The work reveals that cheap-to-use LLMs can boost diagnostic success rates, even outperforming trained clinicians, in health-care settings in Rwanda1 and Pakistan2.\n\nIn Rwanda, chatbot answers outscored those of local clinicians across every metric assessed. And in Pakistan, physicians using LLMs to aid their diagnosis achieved a mean diagnostic reasoning score of 71%, versus 43% for those using conventional resources.\n\n“The papers highlight how LLMs might be able to support clinicians in lower- and middle-income countries to improve the level of care,” says Caroline Green, director of research at the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford, UK.\n\nReal-world complexity\n\nIn the Rwanda study, researchers tested whether LLMs could give accurate clinical information to patients in low-resource health systems across four districts. A common problem there is that there are too few doctors and nurses to see all patients, so most people are seen and triaged by community workers with little training, says study co-author Bilal Mateen, the London-based chief AI officer at PATH, a global non-profit organization that is dedicated to health equity.\n\nMateen’s team asked about 100 community health workers to compile a list of more than 5,600 clinical questions they tend to receive from patients.\n\nThe researchers compared the responses generated by five LLMs to roughly 500 of these questions against answers from trained local clinicians. Grading the responses on a 5-point scale revealed that all the LLMs outperformed local clinicians across all 11 metrics, which included alignment with established medical consensus, understanding the question and the likelihood of the response leading to harm. The team also demonstrated that the LLMs could answer roughly 100 questions in Kinyarwanda, the national language of Rwanda.\n\nMedical AI can transform medicine — but only if we carefully track the data it touches\n\nMateen says that LLMs have another advantage: that they are available for consultation by a community health worker 24/7, which isn’t the case for physicians. LLMs were also 500 times cheaper per response — clinician-generated answers cost an average of US$5.43 for doctors and $3.80 for nurses, whereas LLM responses cost $0.0035 in English and $0.0044 in Kinyarwanda.\n\nThis study “suggests that commercial LLMs are able to give medically and culturally appropriate responses to common queries”, says Adam Rodman, a clinical and AI researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nHowever, Rodman remains sceptical about comparing LLMs to human performance. This sort of evaluation mechanism of written answers is good at measuring models, he says, but less so human performance.\n\nDiagnostic accuracy\n\nIn Pakistan, researchers led by Ihsan Qazi, a computer scientist at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, found that LLMs can boost diagnostic accuracy in low-resource health-care settings2. There, says, Qazi, a paucity of medical specialists and enormous patient loads cause a high number of diagnostic errors.\n\nQazi’s team conducted a randomized controlled trial in which 58 licensed physicians received 20 hours of training in how to use LLMs to assist with diagnosing patients’ symptoms and to be wary of mistakes or hallucinations made by the programs.\n\nPhysicians who had access to the GPT-4o LLM had substantially improved diagnostic accuracy ratings when reviewing clinical cases compared with those using only PubMed and Internet searches. Physicians with access to LLMs achieved a mean diagnostic reasoning score of 71%, whereas those using conventional resources achieved 43%.\n\nAI could help doctors and nurses see and triage more patients in clinics with limited resources.Credit: Guerchom Ndebo/AFP via Getty\n\nA secondary analysis found that an LLM alone achieved better scores than did physicians assisted by an LLM. However, there were exceptions. In 31% of cases, the physicians did better than the median lone AI performance. “It turned out that these cases involved red flags, contextual factors, which the LLM seems to have missed,” says Qazi.\n\nQazi expects his results to be applicable to other countries, but says they need to be replicated using other chatbots. “This work opens up new avenues that can eventually lead to more safe and effective integration of AI and health care,” he says.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many clinics in countries like Rwanda and Pakistan have too few doctors and nurses, making it hard to diagnose patients accurately and quickly. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, powered by large language models (LLMs), have shown they can pass medical exams in tests. But it was unclear if they could help in real clinics with real patients.\n\n**What happened** – Two new studies tested these AI chatbots in real healthcare settings. In Rwanda, chatbots answered medical questions better than local clinicians. They responded to over 500 common patient questions in both English and Kinyarwanda, Rwanda’s main language. In Pakistan, doctors using an AI chatbot called GPT-4o to help diagnose patients scored 71% accuracy, much higher than the 43% accuracy of doctors using traditional resources like medical books and the internet.\n\n**Impact** – These results show that cheap AI chatbots can support healthcare workers in places with few doctors. The chatbots provide fast, accurate answers anytime, and cost much less than human experts. For example, each chatbot answer costs less than half a cent, compared to several dollars for a doctor’s advice. This could help clinics see more patients and reduce mistakes, especially where medical staff are limited.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers want to test these AI tools in more countries and with different chatbots to confirm their benefits. They also plan to improve AI so it can recognize warning signs and special patient details better. This will help make sure AI supports doctors safely and effectively.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Affordable AI chatbots are proving to be practical helpers that improve medical diagnoses in clinics with limited healthcare resources.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Dans des pays comme le Rwanda et le Pakistan, les cliniques manquent souvent de médecins et d’infirmiers, ce qui complique des diagnostics rapides et précis. Les chatbots d’intelligence artificielle (IA) basés sur de grands modèles de langage (LLM) réussissent les examens médicaux en laboratoire, mais leur efficacité en conditions réelles restait incertaine.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Deux études récentes ont testé ces chatbots IA dans des contextes de soins réels. Au Rwanda, les chatbots ont répondu mieux que les cliniciens locaux à plus de 500 questions courantes des patients, en anglais et en kinyarwanda, la langue nationale. Au Pakistan, les médecins utilisant un chatbot IA nommé GPT-4o pour aider au diagnostic ont obtenu une précision moyenne de 71%, contre 43% pour ceux qui se basaient sur des ressources classiques comme les livres médicaux.\n\n**Impact** – Ces résultats montrent que des chatbots IA peu coûteux peuvent soutenir les soignants dans les zones où les médecins sont rares. Les chatbots fournissent des réponses rapides et précises à toute heure, pour un coût très faible : moins d’un centime par réponse, contre plusieurs dollars pour un avis médical humain. Cela pourrait permettre aux cliniques de voir plus de patients et de réduire les erreurs, surtout quand le personnel médical est limité.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs veulent tester ces outils IA dans d’autres pays et avec différents chatbots pour confirmer leurs bénéfices. Ils prévoient aussi d’améliorer l’IA pour qu’elle repère mieux les signes d’alerte et les détails spécifiques aux patients, afin d’aider les médecins de façon sûre et efficace.\n\n**En une phrase** – Des chatbots IA abordables s’imposent comme des aides pratiques qui améliorent les diagnostics médicaux dans les cliniques aux ressources limitées.\n",
