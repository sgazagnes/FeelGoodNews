The conference, known as Greenland Science Week, had a theme of ‘All Eyes on Greenland’ — a particularly resonant title following US president Donald Trump’s threats to take over the island, which gripped the world over the past week.\n\nScience in Greenland, also known as Kalaallit Nunaat and currently an autonomous territory of Denmark, is globally important and it is booming. Over the past five years, its government has taken steps to prioritize science, strengthen research infrastructure and bolster collaborations between scientists working there and the international scientific community.\n\nOn 21 January, global tensions eased somewhat when Trump ruled out using military force to take the island. But he also reiterated his desire for the United States to get 'total' access to Greenland after speaking to reporters on his way back from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Further talks between Trump and European leaders are expected, and much uncertainty remains. What, if anything, these tensions mean for research in Greenland is unclear.\n\nUnique for research\n\nThe history of research in Greenland includes science stemming from Inuit traditional knowledge, European polar explorations and US military expeditions. By the 1990s, the island had become a global centre for climate-change research, after European- and US-led teams drilled ice cores deep into Greenland’s ice sheet to reveal past changes in climate1,2.\n\nToday, climate scientists from around the world measure, analyse and predict changes in Greenland’s ice sheet. If it were to melt entirely, the ice sheet would raise the global sea level by 7.4 metres; last year, it lost an estimated 129 billion tonnes of ice, and it is responsible for around 20% of current sea-level rise, or about 0.8 millimeters a year.\n\nBut “Greenland is about more than just ice and climate indicators”, says a 2022 document from Greenland's government that laid out its first-ever research strategy. Greenland is also a hub of geological and minerals research, given its unique geology and its promise of holding many critical raw materials such as lithium3. And Greenland is a unique place for genetic and biomedical research, given that its mostly Inuit population has been living around the edges of an icy island for millennia; that physical isolation led to genomic and other changes unlike anywhere else in the world4.\n\nThe 2022 plan, which lays out the island’s research priorities up to 2030, emphasized that research needs to be anchored in Greenland and to respond to social needs while being open to international collaboration and with findings being made available to everyone.\n\nResearchers have been studying Greenland’s glacial ice sheet to monitor the evolution of surface lakes and the motion of the surrounding ice sheet.Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty\n\nA burgeoning research community\n\nThe strategy has helped to bolster the island's tiny research community. One big initiative is the research vessel Tarojoq, which is the largest research investment by Greenland’s government so far. It came into operation in 2022, costing 235 million Danish kroner (US$37 million) from the government and private foundations.\n\nLast August, in one of its many expeditions, the Tarojoq and its crew brought a team led by Fiamma Straneo, a polar scientist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to study how glacial meltwater interacts with the rich ecosystem in a fjord in eastern Greenland. The ship’s agility allowed the team to sail close to the water’s edge, deploying scientific instruments to continue long-term observations of changes in this crucial part of the Arctic5. “This ship is incredibly useful to our research,” Straneo says.\n\nOther new infrastructure includes Greenland’s first artificial-intelligence-enabled computing resources, which were installed last year at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources in Nuuk. Researchers are using this server for studies such as identifying and classifying marine species in video and acoustic data gathered underwater, says Diana Krawczyk, a polar scientist at the institute. Such tasks used to take weeks or months, but scientists can now rapidly perform studies such as modelling and forecasting the location of fish and other marine resources in the waters around Greenland.",

      "content": "An “epigenetic” adaptation could prevent large numbers of loggerhead turtles from hatching as female due to climate change – a threat that was feared to lead to population collapse\n\nA young loggerhead turtle in the Caribbean Sea near the Bahamas WaterFrame/Alamy\n\nSea turtles may be better able to cope with climate change than we had thought. Biologists are concerned that the reptiles might face extinction because warmer conditions will encourage most turtle eggs to develop into females. But it turns out the animals have a genetic safety net that could help them retain a more even balance between sexes even as temperatures rise.\n\n“We believe we have uncovered the capacity of turtles to adjust to the environment they are in,” says Chris Eizaguirre at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nThe sex of baby sea turtles isn’t set by a sex-determining chromosome – as happens in many animals, including humans – but by the temperature inside the nest. Lab studies have shown that, at lower nest temperatures, more hatchlings will be male and at higher ones, more will be female, leading to fears that global warming will cause ever more turtles to hatch as female.\n\nFor example, a 2018 genetic study found that about 99 per cent of young green turtles (Chelonia mydas) aged between about 4 and 20 originating from warmer Great Barrier Reef nesting sites in Australia were female. Modelling based on such results has led to concerns that, without enough males, sea turtle populations will collapse.\n\nYet the actual state of affairs upon hatching is a mystery because you can’t tell what sex a turtle is until it is several months old unless you kill it to check, so field data on hatchling sex is scant.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Weekly The best of New Scientist, including long-reads, culture, podcasts and news, each week. Sign up to newsletter\n\nTo get around this, Eizaguirre and his colleagues have run lab and field experiments with loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta).\n\nIn the first part of their work, they collected a total of 240 eggs from seven loggerhead nests on beaches in Palm Beach county, Florida. They put the eggs in artificial incubators at one of three temperatures: 27°C (81°F), a male-promoting temperature; 30°C (86°F), a “pivotal temperature for equal numbers of males and females; and 32°C (90°F), which should result in females.\n\nWhen the hatchlings were between 1 and 3 days old, the team collected blood samples and then reared the turtles in captivity for months until they were large enough for sex verification via keyhole surgery and a laparoscopic camera.\n\nComparing genome sequencing data gleaned from the blood samples with the sex identification revealed that, regardless of the temperature at which the eggs had been incubated, male and female turtles each had different patterns in the activity of hundreds of genes because of an epigenetic process known as DNA methylation. Some 383 genes were hypermethylated in females – meaning they were less active than expected – and 394 were hypermethylated in males. Many of these genes have documented roles in sex development. This meant the researchers could tell the sex of a baby turtle just from a blood sample.\n\nThe team used this knowledge in a field study by collecting 29 newly laid loggerhead turtle egg clutches on the beaches of Sal Island in Cape Verde off the coast of West Africa. They divided each clutch, burying one half in a protected area at a depth of 55 centimetres – where it would be cooler – and the other 35 centimetres down, where it would be warmer, and monitored the temperatures.\n\nWhen the researchers sequenced blood cell samples from 116 hatchlings, half from the “cool” depths and half from the “warm” ones, they found more males than expected given the temperatures that the eggs had experienced. In fact, models based on the incubation temperature overestimated female hatchling production by between 50 and 60 per cent.\n\nThis suggests that, in addition to providing a tool for sexing baby turtles, the work shows there are molecular mechanisms that help turtles cope with changes in climate by altering how sensitive the development of their sex organs is to temperature, says Eizaguirre.\n\n“We are not saying that there is no feminisation because there is, and we’re not saying that climate change does not exist because it is there and it’s accelerating,” he says. “What we are saying is that when the populations are large enough, when there is sufficient diversity, then it looks like the species [can] evolve in response to the climate they live in.”\n\nThe work backs up recent evidence by a team including Graeme Hays at Deakin University in Australia showing that more male sea turtles are hatching than predicted if it is assumed that temperature is the only driver of sex determination. These results indicate how the pivotal temperature at which the turtle sex ratio is 50:50 can be adapted to local conditions, says Hays.\n\nTurtles also have other mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of warming, he says. These include nesting earlier in the year and patterns of migration to breeding areas reducing the impact of feminisation. “Female turtles generally do not breed every year, but males travel to breeding grounds more often than females,” says Hays. “So, the breeding sex ratio is more balanced than the actual adult sex ratio.”\n\nSuch behavioural adaptations are good, says Eizaguirre, but the hatchlings are still exposed to extreme heat, which leaves lasting DNA methylation changes, so signs of molecular adaptation are even better news for these vulnerable reptiles.",

The discovery offers fresh insight into how some of Earth’s most important mineral resources reach the surface.",
      "content": "Scientists studying rare rocks buried deep beneath central Australia have uncovered how one of the world's most promising new sources of niobium came to be. Niobium is a critical metal used to strengthen steel and support clean energy technologies, and its origins are tied to dramatic geological events that unfolded more than 800 million years ago.\n\nThe research, led by Curtin University, shows that these newly identified niobium-rich rocks formed during the early stages of a massive continental breakup. At the time, Earth's ancient supercontinent Rodinia was beginning to pull apart, creating deep fractures in the crust.\n\nHow Tectonic Forces Brought Metal to the Surface\n\nAccording to the study, molten rock rich in niobium rose from deep within the Earth through long-standing fault zones. These pathways opened during a period of tectonic stretching and rifting that eventually split Rodinia apart. The molten material solidified into rare igneous rocks known as carbonatites, locking valuable metals into the crust.\n\nLead author Dr. Maximilian Dröllner, from the Timescales of Mineral Systems Group within Curtin's Frontier Institute for Geoscience Solutions and the University of Göttingen, said the discovery offers new insight into how rare, metal-rich magmas reach the surface.\n\n\"These carbonatites are unlike anything previously known in the region and contain important concentrations of niobium, a strategic metal used to make lighter, stronger steel for aircraft, pipelines and EVs and a key component in some next-generation battery and superconducting technologies,\" Dr. Dröllner said.\n\nPinpointing an 800-Million-Year-Old Geological Event\n\nBy examining drill core samples, the research team used several isotope-dating methods to determine when the rocks formed. Their results show the carbonatites were emplaced between 830 and 820 million years ago, during a key phase of continental rifting before Rodinia fully broke apart.\n\n\"Using multiple isotope-dating techniques on drill core samples, we found that these carbonatites were emplaced between 830 and 820 million years ago, during a period of continental rifting that preceded the breakup of Rodinia.\n\n\"This tectonic setting allowed carbonatite magma to rise through fault zones that had remained open and active for hundreds of millions of years, delivering metal-rich melts from deep in the mantle up into the crust.\"\n\nReconstructing Half a Billion Years of Earth History\n\nCurtin co-author Professor Chris Kirkland, also from the Timescales of Mineral Systems Group, said the study highlights how advanced analytical techniques can untangle extremely complex geological timelines.\n\n\"Carbonatites are rare igneous rocks known to host major global deposits of critical metals such as niobium and rare earth elements. But determining when and how they formed has historically been difficult due to their complex geological histories,\" Professor Kirkland said.\n\n\"By analyzing isotopes and using high-resolution imaging, we were able to reconstruct more than 500 million years of geological events that these rocks experienced.\n\n\"This approach allowed us to pinpoint when the carbonatites formed and separate those original magmatic events from changes that happened later in the rocks.\"\n\nThe findings were published in Geological Magazine under the title 'Multi-method geochronology and isotope geochemistry of carbonatites in the Aileron Province, central Australia'.",
