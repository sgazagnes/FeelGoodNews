      "summary": "A newly recognized set of T helper cells seems to guard against aging by eliminating harmful senescent cells. Their presence in supercentenarians suggests they may be a key to maintaining a healthier, age-balanced immune system.",
      "content": "Prof. Alon Monsonego of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev found that T helper lymphocytes, which are immune cells involved in regulating the body's defenses, shift in function as people grow older. These shifts can reflect a person's biological age, which may not match their chronological age. Within these changes, the research team (the labs of Prof. Monsonego and Prof. Esti Yeger-Lotem) identified a previously unknown group of T helper cells that become more common with age.\n\nThe significance of this discovery became clearer when a Japanese study on supercentenarians, meaning individuals who live well past 100, found that this same T helper cell subset was abundant in their immune systems. Prof. Monsonego now believes these cells may help maintain an immune response that is suitable for a person's stage of life.\n\nThe team's findings, led by Dr. Yehezqel Elyahu in collaboration with Prof. Valery Krizhanovsky of the Weizmann Institute of Science, were recently reported in Nature Aging.\n\nAging, Senescent Cells, and the Immune Response\n\nScientists describe aging as a process in which cells gradually lose the ability to repair routine damage. When this occurs, the body shows signs of aging. Senescence cells, which naturally appear when regulated properly, become harmful if they accumulate, since they can trigger inflammation and tissue injury.\n\nThe researchers discovered that a portion of the T helper cells that increase with age unexpectedly have killing capabilities. These cells help remove senescence cells, thereby limiting their negative effects. Prof. Monsonego's work showed that reducing the number of these T helper cells in mice caused the animals to age more quickly and shortened their lifespan.\n\nThis unusual and highly specialized subset of T helper cells continues to rise in number with age and appears to play an important role in slowing the aging process.\n\nTracking Biological Age and Rethinking Immune Resetting\n\nBecause T helper cells shift as people age and appear central to how aging unfolds, Prof. Monosonego and his team suggest monitoring these immune patterns in individuals beginning in their 30s. Such tracking could reveal how quickly someone is aging biologically and help guide early steps to support healthy aging. Differences of decades can develop between biological and chronological ages.\n\n\"People say that to reverse aging and \"rejuvenate,\" we need to reset their immune system like the immune systems of people in their 20s. However, our research shows that this might not be the case. People don't need a super-charged immune system; they need one that is working properly and appropriate for their stage in life. So, one of the \"axioms\" of how to reduce aging may be incorrect,\" says Prof. Monsonego.\n\nIn addition to offering new insight into aging, the newly identified cells may also be useful in diagnostics and future treatments addressing dysregulated aging, longevity, and diseases linked to aging.\n\nResearch Team and Support\n\nProf. Monsonego is part of The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics in the Faculty of Health Sciences at BGU, and is also affiliated with TheSchool of Brain Sciences and Cognition.\n\nContributors to the research included Ilana Feygin, Ekaterina Eremenko, Noa Pinkas, Alon Zemer, Amit Shicht, Omer Berner, Roni Avigdory-Meiri, Anna Nemirovsky, and Keren Reshef from BGU, along with Lior Roitman from Weizmann.\n\nThe work received support from the Israel Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant no. 3-16148) and the Litwin and Gural Foundations.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – As people get older, their bodies change in many ways. One important change happens in the immune system, which protects the body from sickness. Scientists have been studying how certain immune cells called T helper cells change with age.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev found a new group of T helper cells that increase in number as people grow older. These special cells help remove harmful senescent cells, which are old cells that stop working properly and can cause damage. The team also found these cells in large amounts in supercentenarians—people who live past 100 years old. Their study was published recently in the journal Nature Aging.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it shows a natural way the body may protect itself from aging. The harmful senescent cells can cause inflammation and tissue damage, but these T helper cells help clear them out. In tests with mice, reducing these cells made the mice age faster. This means these immune cells might slow down aging and help people stay healthier longer.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists want to track these immune cells in people starting in their 30s to better understand how fast someone is aging biologically, which can be different from their actual age. This could lead to new ways to support healthy aging and develop treatments for age-related diseases. Also, the idea that we need to reset the immune system to a young state might change, focusing instead on keeping it working well for each age.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A newly found type of immune cell that removes harmful old cells may play a key role in slowing aging and keeping the immune system balanced as we grow older.",

      "title": "Scientists find a surprising link between lead and human evolution",
      "summary": "Researchers found that ancient hominids—including early humans—were exposed to lead throughout childhood, leaving chemical traces in fossil teeth. Experiments suggest this exposure may have driven genetic changes that strengthened language-related brain functions in modern humans.",
      "content": "A major international research effort is reshaping the long-held belief that lead exposure is primarily a modern problem. The new findings show that early human ancestors encountered lead repeatedly for more than two million years, suggesting that this toxic metal may have played an unexpected role in shaping the evolution of hominid brains, behavior, and possibly language.\n\nThe study -- published in Science Advances -- also offers a new angle on why modern humans ultimately surpassed Neanderthals. Lab-grown brain organoids with Neanderthal genetic variants reacted more strongly to lead than organoids with human genetics, hinting that Neanderthals may have been more vulnerable to lead's neurological effects.\n\nResearchers from the Geoarchaeology and Archaeometry Research Group (GARG) at Southern Cross University (Australia), the Department of Environmental Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital (New York, USA), and the School of Medicine at the University of California San Diego (UCSD, USA) combined fossil chemistry, brain organoid experiments, and evolutionary genetics to uncover how lead factored into hominid history.\n\nEvidence of Ancient Lead Exposure in Fossil Teeth\n\nFor many years, lead toxicity was assumed to be closely tied to human industry, including smelting, mining, and the use of leaded petrol and paint. That view shifted when researchers analysed 51 fossil teeth from a range of hominids and great apes, including Australopithecus africanus, Paranthropus robustus, early Homo, Neanderthals, and Homo sapiens. The teeth showed clear chemical traces of intermittent lead exposure that stretch back nearly two million years.\n\nHigh-precision laser-ablation geochemistry performed at Southern Cross University's GARG Facility (located in Lismore, NSW) and at Mount Sinai's Exposomics laboratories revealed distinct 'lead bands' in the enamel and dentine. These bands formed during childhood and indicate recurring periods of lead intake from environmental sources (such as polluted water, soil, or volcanic activity) or from lead stored in the body's bones and released during times of stress or illness.\n\n\"Our data show that lead exposure wasn't just a product of the Industrial Revolution -- it was part of our evolutionary landscape,\" said Professor Renaud Joannes-Boyau, Head of the GARG research group at Southern Cross University.\n\n\"This means that the brains of our ancestors developed under the influence of a potent toxic metal, which may have shaped their social behavior and cognitive abilities over millennia.\"\n\nHow Lead Interacted With Early Brain Development\n\nTo understand the functional impact of this exposure, the team studied human brain organoids, which serve as simplified, lab-grown models of early brain development. They tested how lead affected two versions of a key developmental gene known as NOVA1, which regulates gene expression under lead exposure during neurodevelopment. The modern human version of NOVA1 differs from the variant seen in Neanderthals and other extinct hominids, although the reason for this evolutionary change was previously unclear.\n\nOrganoids carrying the Neanderthal-like NOVA1 variant showed substantial disruptions in FOXP2-expressing neurons in the cortex and thalamus when exposed to lead. These brain regions are essential for language and speech development. Organoids with the modern human NOVA1 gene showed far less disruption.\n\n\"These results suggest that our NOVA1 variant may have offered protection against the harmful neurological effects of lead,\" said Professor Alysson Muotri, Professor of Pediatrics/Cellular & Molecular Medicine and Director of the UC San Diego Sanford Stem Cell Institute Integrated Space Stem Cell Orbital Research Center.\n\n\"It's an extraordinary example of how an environmental pressure, in this case, lead toxicity, could have driven genetic changes that improved survival and our ability to communicate using language, but which now also influence our vulnerability to modern lead exposure.\"\n\nGenetic Insights Into the Rise of Modern Humans\n\nGenetic and proteomic data from the study showed that lead exposure in organoids with archaic gene variants disrupted multiple pathways tied to neurodevelopment, communication, and social behavior. The FOXP2 disruptions are especially noteworthy because of FOXP2's well-established role in speech and language. These results suggest that long-term pressure from environmental toxins may have nudged cognitive and communicative traits along different evolutionary paths in modern humans and Neanderthals.\n\n\"This study shows how our environmental exposures shaped our evolution,\" said Professor Manish Arora, Professor and Vice Chairman of Environmental Medicine.\n\n\"From the perspective of inter-species competition, the observation that toxic exposures can offer an overall survival advantage offers a fresh paradigm for environmental medicine to examine the evolutionary roots of disorders linked to environmental exposures.\"\n\nWhat Ancient Lead Exposure Means for Us Today\n\nAlthough modern lead exposure is mostly linked to industrial activities, it continues to pose a serious health threat, especially for children. The new findings show that human susceptibility to lead may be deeply rooted in our evolutionary past and shaped by interactions between genes and environmental conditions.\n\n\"Our work not only rewrites the history of lead exposure,\" added Professor Joannes-Boyau, \"it also reminds us that the interaction between our genes and the environment has been shaping our species for millions of years, and continues to do so.\"\n\nThe research drew on fossil teeth from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania, using detailed geochemical mapping to trace childhood episodes of lead intake. In parallel, brain organoids containing either modern or archaic NOVA1 genes were used to study how lead affected brain development, with particular attention to FOXP2, a gene central to language. Genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses were combined to build a broad understanding of how lead may have influenced the evolution of hominid cognition and social behavior.",

      "title": "The birth of the climate doula",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "This story was originally reported by Jessica Kutz of The 19th.\n\nIn the days leading up to Hurricane Irma’s landfall in September 2017, Esther Louis made preparations to flee Florida with her husband and four children. The Category 4 Hurricane was expected to hit the Florida Keys and make it’s way up the state, posing a risk to millions of residents. One of those residents was a client of Louis’ who was nine months pregnant and living in a home that the Miami-based doula feared was in too poor of condition to withstand the storm.\n\nAs a doula, Louis was trained to provide holistic care to her client, anticipating all the factors that may affect her health. She worried about how the stress of an impending hurricane and evacuation could impact her client’s pregnancy. So she offered to escort her client and her family toward Georgia, where Louis was headed and where her client had relatives.\n\nThe caravan of two families departed together, inching their way in evacuation traffic to the Georgia border. What would have been an eight hour drive took 24 hours. “It was stressful,” Louis said. Her client started to experience Braxton Hicks contractions which can be caused by stress. At times they would switch drivers so she could provide emotional support to her client, who was worried about all that could go wrong on the drive. “Sometimes people go to the worst possible outcome but I’m like, ‘We’re going to get there, OK? We’re going to work it out.’”\n\nThe experience was one of many instances in Louis’ career where the worsening climate crisis had complicated a client’s birthing journey. She realized that if doulas like herself had proper training on how to communicate the risks of hurricane season, flooding and even extreme heat to their clients, they would be better prepared in the event of a disaster like Irma.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nThey would also be filling an important information gap that could protect pregnancies, particularly for Black people, who have a higher climate risk and higher maternal mortality rates.\n\nOver the past decade, a growing body of research has linked environmental threats like extreme heat and wildfire smoke to an uptick in stillbirths, premature births and low-birth weights. These factors also cause health problems for pregnant people, including an association with developing preeclampsia, a high blood pressure condition that can be deadly. More recently, studies have linked climate-related disasters with higher rates of maternal mental health issues like postpartum depression.\n\nSo in 2024, after years of providing some of this training herself to doulas in the Miami-Dade area, Louis partnered with Dr. Cheryl Holder, cofounder of Florida Clinicians for Climate Action, a nonprofit that seeks to teach health professionals how to incorporate climate change into their work. They won a grant that would help them develop a curriculum and training known as the Doula C-Hot program, to teach doulas how to assess the climate risk of their clients and help them better prepare for future climate threats. If the pilot is successful it could serve as a blueprint for how to train doulas across the country as climate educators.\n\nA survey conducted by Louis and other advocacy groups focused on maternal health found that doulas, who provide emotional and physical support to pregnant people, were already seeing the everyday risks the changing climate posed to their clients’ pregnancies and doing their best to help them cope.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nIn New Orleans, doulas have shown up at emergency shelters to figure out what people need to safely feed their infants when access to sterile water needed for infant formula isn’t always available or places to privately breastfeed can be hard to find. And in Philadelphia, doulas are playing an important role in educating patients on environmental exposures to contaminants like lead or air pollution.\n\nSome doulas, like Houston-based Sierra Sankofa, have even developed disaster planning workshops aimed at pregnant people and families with young children that can help them better prepare for staying warm in the winter and cool in the summer. She’s covered topics like how to know if breast milk is still safe if the power has gone out and how to sanitize bottles with no electricity.\n\nBut while many doulas are already helping their patients through climate-related disasters, the survey identified another trend: 95 percent of them wanted more training and resources to help pregnant people deal with environmental threats and hazards.\n\nSo far the pilot program in Florida, which has been running for almost a year, has trained 12 doulas on the impacts of climate change on pregnancy and maternal health. It follows a model developed by Holder, a collaborator on the project, who similarly trained clinicians to understand climate health risks. She wanted to focus her efforts on reaching pregnant people, particularly from the marginalized populations she already works with as a doctor.\n\n“Where else should we start, other than with pregnant folks? That’s two lives, the next generation,” she said. “And if we can’t learn lessons to save the newborn, the unborn and the mom, how are we in society going to do anything?”\n\nShe knew doulas could be more effective in that work, due to the close relationships they develop with their patients and the time they spend with them. They also conduct home visits and are able to understand more holistically what may be impacting a pregnant person’s health.\n\nNationally, doulas are being recognized for their additive care, with many states passing legislation in recent years to cover their services under Medicaid in order to improve birth outcomes, particularly for women of color.\n\nAs part of their training with the project, the doulas work with their clients to gauge their preparedness, said Louis, who helped develop the assessment tool. They ask them questions like do they have an air conditioning unit? Or someone they can borrow $50 from in case of an emergency? Do they have a place to go if a disaster hits?\n\nDepending on their answers, the doulas are then able to offer advice, like where to find a cooling center, or resources including portable air conditioners for those without AC. They also help their clients do things like look up whether they live in a flood zone, and assist them in developing plans to prepare for a hurricane or other natural disaster. They then reassess their patients after these climate-focused meetings to understand if they are now better prepared to deal with heat or hurricanes during their pregnancies. So far they’ve worked with over 40 clients. If the pilot program is successful, they hope to build out the tools and training to make it accessible beyond Florida.\n\nAlready they are thinking of ways to reach more pregnant people, said Zainab Jah, a researcher evaluating the program. For one, they would like to expand the languages of their materials, which are in English. In the parts of Miami-Dade and Broward County where they work, there are communities who speak Haitian Creole and Spanish. Some of their doulas are able to translate, but they’d like to focus on language equity as they grow the program.\n\nMeanwhile, other models are being developed. In Oregon, Nurturely, an advocacy group that focuses on perinatal equity, or improving pregnancy outcomes, is working on a similar train-the-trainer model set to launch in 2026, which aims to expand the knowledge of birthworkers around wildfire season and wildfire smoke. “The perinatal period is a very delicate period. So there are niche needs and preparation for people in that category,” said Aver Yakubu, a program director with the organization.\n\nMany of the doulas Yakubu has spoken to in the state are aware of the dangers of wildfires, but “they don’t know where to start or what to say to their patients,” she said. This training would aim to fill that information void and connect clients to resources. In Oregon, for example, pregnant Medicaid patients can use their coverage to pay for things like air conditioners and air purifiers, which can buffer them from the effects of heat and smoke.\n\nStill, there are limitations to using doulas to reach those most socioeconomically vulnerable to the climate crisis. Doula care is expensive, and while Florida can reimburse doulas under the state’s Medicaid program, it’s been difficult in practice for doulas to qualify and receive payment. In Texas, where Sankofa works, she said the current Medicaid reimbursements leave out community-based doulas who specifically help marginalized groups by only recognizing certain certifications. Many community-based doulas have received training outside of those certifying bodies and are holistically meeting the needs of their clients, she argues. She’s advocating to change the law to allow for a broader definition of who could meet those guidelines.\n\nBut even if there is progress on improving doula coverage, the future of Medicaid itself is up in the air. A majority of the clients being reached by the Florida pilot program are on Medicaid, and nationally, the program covers 41 percent of all births. But with the impending cuts to the program pushed through under the Trump administration, coverage could dwindle.\n\n“I think that’s the biggest issue right now,” Jah said. “I think we’re just all actively in the space of trying to learn from one another and brainstorm to figure out what can be done. But I think that’s going to be a huge barrier.”\n\nWhile figuring out some of the logistical and financial obstacles will be difficult, Holder believes the training they are providing doulas is crucial to the health of pregnant people in a state where climate change is wreaking havoc.\n\n“I would really love to see this program fully tested and expanded and incorporated in general medical care,” she said. “This is the new environment we live in.”",

They started a pilot training in Florida, reaching 12 doulas who then worked with over 40 pregnant clients to improve their safety plans.\n\n**Impact** – This program is important because it fills a gap in knowledge about how climate change affects pregnancy. Pregnant people face higher risks like premature births and health problems from heat and natural disasters. Doulas can provide emotional support and practical help, such as finding cooling centers or checking if a home is in a flood zone. The program especially helps Black and low-income communities, who often face greater climate risks and health challenges.\n\n**What's next step** – If the pilot is successful, the program hopes to expand beyond Florida, offering materials in more languages like Spanish and Haitian Creole. Similar projects are being planned in other states, like Oregon, focusing on wildfire smoke. Advocates also want to improve Medicaid coverage so more people can afford doula care, though this remains a challenge.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new training program is helping doulas guide pregnant people through climate-related health risks, aiming to protect mothers and babies during extreme weather events.\n",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nMost of us know the feeling of standing in front of a painting that makes us pause. Maybe it’s a burst of color that lifts our mood or a quiet scene that steadies the mind. Either way, a new study from King’s College London suggests that these moments are doing far more than sparking emotion. Researchers have found measurable evidence that viewing original art can support both mental health and long-term physical well-being.\n\nTheir findings point to something powerful: spending even a short amount of time with original artworks may reduce stress, improve emotional balance, and potentially contribute to a longer, healthier life. And the best part is that you do not need to be an art expert to benefit.\n\nWhat the study actually measured\n\nTo explore the connection between art and health, researchers invited fifty healthy adults between the ages of eighteen and forty to take part in an experiment. One group visited The Courtauld Gallery in London, where they viewed original masterpieces by artists including Vincent van Gogh and Édouard Manet. A second group viewed high-quality reproductions in a non-gallery setting.\n\nParticipants wore sensors that tracked heart rate, skin temperature, and other subtle responses. They also provided saliva samples before and after the experience so researchers could measure changes in stress and inflammation.\n\nThe results were striking:\n\nCortisol, better known as the body’s primary stress hormone, fell by 22 percent among gallery visitors. Those who saw reproductions saw only an eight percent drop.\n\nPro-inflammatory cytokines decreased by 30 percent in the gallery group and 28 percent in the reproduction group.\n\nGallery visitors also showed signs of emotional engagement, including small drops in skin temperature and variation in heart-rate patterns.\n\nThese shifts matter because high cortisol and inflammation are linked to chronic conditions such as anxiety, heart disease, and diabetes. In other words, your quiet moment with an original painting could be supporting your long-term health in ways you cannot feel immediately.\n\nWhy original art matters even more\n\nAlthough both groups experienced some positive changes, the impact was stronger for those who viewed original artworks. Researchers believe that the immersive environment of a gallery adds layers of sensory experience with elements that highlight space, scale, texture, and atmosphere. These aspects work together to deepen the body’s response.\n\nImportantly, the researchers emphasized that the benefits appeared regardless of art knowledge or emotional intelligence. You do not need to understand an artist’s entire catalog or even consider yourself an “art person” to gain something meaningful.\n\nA simple, accessible step toward wellbeing\n\nThe implications of this study reach beyond museum walls. These findings help pave the way for broader integration of art and wellbeing, offering a low-cost and accessible option for reducing loneliness, easing depression, and improving life satisfaction.\n\nAnd while art may not replace clinical care, it can be a gentle, joyful tool to add to your wellness routine. The next time you find yourself lingering in front of a painting, know that your body is responding in ways that support you; calming, stimulating, and restoring at the same time.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – A study from King’s College London explored how looking at original art affects our health. Many people feel calm or happy when they see a painting they like, but researchers wanted to see if this feeling has real health benefits.\n\n**What happened** – Fifty adults visited either The Courtauld Gallery in London to see original paintings by famous artists like Vincent van Gogh or viewed high-quality reproductions outside a gallery. Scientists measured their heart rate, skin temperature, stress hormones, and inflammation before and after the visits.\n\n**Impact** – The group who saw original art showed a 22% drop in cortisol, the hormone linked to stress, compared to only an 8% drop for those who saw reproductions. Inflammation also decreased more after viewing originals. These changes are important because high stress and inflammation can lead to serious health problems like heart disease and diabetes. The study shows that even a short visit to an art gallery can help your body relax and improve long-term health.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers hope these results encourage more people to visit galleries as a simple way to support mental and physical health.
