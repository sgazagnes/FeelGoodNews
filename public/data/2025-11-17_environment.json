      "summary": "Açaí is everywhere, but Brazil hopes more of its fruits rich in antioxidants and fibre will soon be enjoyed around the world.",
      "content": "Move over açaí - the Amazon has more 'superfoods' to offer\n\n20 hours ago Share Save Georgina Rannard Climate and science reporter, Belém, Brazil Share Save\n\nGetty Images Açaí is a popular health food sold around the world\n\nIn a lab in a renovated warehouse on the banks of a churning, brown river in Belém, Brazil, machines are pulping candidates for the next global \"superfood\". Cupuaçu... Taperebá... Bacaba... Like açaí berries - these fruits are rich in antioxidants, fibre or fatty acids. If Brazil has its way, they could soon be popping up on your social media feeds and being sold in fashionable cafes in the UK, Europe and the US. It's part of a bold plan by the country, which is hosting the COP30 UN climate talks, to tackle climate change, protect nature and create wealth in the face of considerable regional poverty. \"There's a lot of superfoods in the forest that people don't know,\" says Max Petrucci, founder of a local company Mahta that sells powdered cacao and Brazil nuts for shakes. The drink he gives me to try is gritty and tastes like chocolate without sugar.\n\nGetty Images Cupuaçu fruit is little known outside of the Amazon\n\n\"We're focussed first on nutrition and the health benefits that these Amazonian ingredients provide,\" he explains. But the second benefit, he explains, is \"social and environmental\". He says they pay fair prices and only buy from farmers who practice sustainable farming. It sounds like a marketing pitch and the company's slick packaging promises \"ancestral ingredients\" and the \"power of purple fruits from the forest\".\n\nGetty Images Taperebá is another Amazonian fruit used for juices in some parts of northern Brazil\n\nScientific research into the benefits of \"superfoods\" is limited, but eating Amazonian fruits is generally recognised to be good for you. Larissa Bueno, also at Mahta, explains that they only sell powdered foods - \"similar to Huel in the UK,\" she says. Transporting raw fruits that degrade within days of picking is expensive. But if companies freeze dry ingredients into powders to sell to supermarkets or ship abroad, \"it keeps more of the nutritional value and it's a smart way to keep more economic value in Brazil\", she explains.\n\nGetty Images Açaí fruit is harvested from palm trees - many in Pará state in Brazil\n\nThe lab in Belém's Bioeconomy Park is helping small companies test new ways of preserving fruits. \"People have been eating from these forests for more than 10,000 years. There are many, many, many undiscovered superfoods, \" Max says. The Amazon rainforest, which covers 6 million sq km (2.3 million sq miles), has always been full of natural wealth. But for decades its vast ecosystem has been decaying, with areas chopped down to sell timber or clear space for cattle or crops like soy. This damaged one of the earth's great protections against climate change - trees that soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide. Unusually, more than two-thirds of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions come from land use and agriculture, rather than energy like most countries. Those emissions mainly stem from cutting down forest or growing vast amounts of food.\n\nGetty Images Some farmers work on small parcels of land in the rainforest to sell products like coffee or fruit\n\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has promised to halve deforestation by 2030. In the 12 months to July 2025, rates reached an 11-year low. But the forest is a resource. The nearly 30 million people living in the Amazon region, and across Brazil, need and want to make a living. Brazil is pushing the idea of building a prospering economy by sustainably using natural resources, preserving nature to protect the vitality of the land, and developing valuable products including fuels, pharmaceuticals, and foods. Building this \"bio-economy\" features strongly in its national climate action plan. Sarah Sampaio runs a small coffee company that grows coffee beans in the shadow of trees, using a method called agroforesty - or agriculture that helps cultivate forests. She works with around 200 farming families in the Apui region, which has one of the highest rates of deforestation.\n\nCapozoli Sarah Sampaio's company grows coffee in the shade in the Amazon\n\n\"We plant native Amazonian trees and the coffee together. The trees shade the coffee plants and farmers can also grow their own food around those plants,\" she says. \"When the coffee plant dies, the trees remain as the forest, so it's helping to restore the Amazon.\" The fresh brew I'm given has a light, fruity taste, and she's proud that three of her coffees were selected among the 30 best in Brazil in the national Coffee of the Year competition. \"If we want to stop more trees from being chopped down, we have to provide people with an alternative income, a sustainable way of living,\" Sarah says. Whatever the next Amazonian superfood is, it will need to challenge açaí. The purple berry is grown and eaten in huge quantities in northern Brazil and sold for nearly £10 ($13) per smoothie bowl in parts of London.\n\nGetty Images Brazil produces around a third of the world's coffee\n\nDamien Benoit sells açaí ice cream in Europe. \"It's very high in antioxidants, in fibres and unsaturated fatty acids, and in different minerals that make it very popular among people who do sports,\" he says. He works with families who keeps four hectares of açai plants in the forest \"with a minimum number of species per hectare that must be monitored.\" \"We make sure children go to school, and gender equality is a huge topic for us,\" he claims. On their own, these small companies cannot feed millions of people and, so far, they've prospered due to grants or capital from charities and funds that invest in companies aimed at protecting nature.\n\nCapozoli The Laboratório-Fábrica in Belém's new Bioeconomy park",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 14 November 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03531-5Coastal cities and communities are being hit hard by climate change. These researchers are finding ways to build resilience.",
      "content": "Apple Chui (left), Hannah Eisler Burnett (centre) and Taukiei Kitara study key issues for coastal communities.Credit: L: CPRO, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Apple Chui), M: Véronëque Ignace (Hannah Eisler Burnett)\n\nThe best asset that a coastal area has in the fight against climate change is its people. Whether they’re building sea walls or coral nurseries, or helping to create rich records of flooding events and cultural artefacts, coastal locals are shoring up their neighbourhoods. Scientists Taukiei Kitara from Tuvalu, Hannah Eisler Burnett from New York City and Apple Chui from Hong Kong are working to ensure that the people dealing with coastal challenges have the advocacy, training and protection they need.\n\nTAUKIEI KITARA: Island advocate\n\nSea levels in the Pacific are predicted to rise by 15 cm or more by the 2050s, regardless of global carbon-emission reductions. When this happens, parts of Tuvalu — a group of nine main islands midway between Hawaii and Australia — will vanish forever. “It’s going to be a significant loss for our people,” says Taukiei Kitara, who was born on Nui, a Tuvaluan atoll. Now based at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, Kitara studies how climate change is impacting the culture, identity and sovereignty of small island states in the Pacific.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science cities\n\nThe effect on Tuvalu, which has an average elevation of less than 2 metres above sea level, is severe. Increasingly warmer waters have bleached corals and forced fishermen farther out to sea. Seawater has seeped into the water table, forcing Tuvaluans to grow swamp taro and other staple crops in raised garden beds rather than underground pits — a practice that dates back thousands of years. Rising sea levels are also eroding the coastlines. Kitara says that after his birth, half of his umbilical cord was buried under a newly planted coconut tree some 30 or 40 metres away from the ocean’s edge, as per Tuvaluan tradition. “Now it’s right on the coastline,” he says.\n\nMoving is an option for some Tuvaluans. Australia offers visas for 280 Tuvaluans each year to migrate and obtain permanent residency under the 2023 Falepili Union Treaty — a first-of-its-kind ‘climate visa’ designed to aid climate-induced migration. More than 3,000 Tuvaluans (almost one-third of the nation’s population) have entered a ballot for the first release of visas. But many Tuvaluans aren’t keen on becoming climate refugees, says Kitara, whose research explores the potential impacts of the treaty.\n\nIn a 2023 opinion piece1, Kitara and Carol Farbotko, also from Griffith University, argued that migrants from climate-vulnerable Pacific nations are often framed in Australia as both ‘unskilled labour’ and ‘climate migrants’, which reinforces harmful stereotypes and puts them at risk of workplace exploitation. Kitara and Farbotko called for more just and compassionate labour and climate-migration policies inspired by the Tuvaluan value of fale pili — caring for others like family.\n\nThose who have chosen to stay on Tuvalu are not giving up. The Tuvaluan government wants to bolster the country’s climate resiliency by “focusing on adaptation projects like land reclamation and raising the elevation of existing land”, says Kitara. Between 2017 and 2023, Tuvalu’s capital Funafuti was expanded by 5%, or 7.8 hectares, by dredging up sand from its lagoon. Sea walls were constructed on the outer islands of Nanumaga and Nanumea to protect some 2,780 metres of coastline from rising sea levels and storm surges.\n\nThe narrowest part of Funafuti island, Tuvalu.Credit: Kalolaine Fainu/Guardian/eyevine\n\nTuvalu is also seeking refuge in a more unusual place: the metaverse. Since 2023, efforts have been under way to create a ‘digital twin’ of the island nation — a virtual reconstruction that includes details such as the locations of shops, houses and trees, as well as records of cultural artefacts, including recipes, dances, stories and memories. The project, which is being run by the Tuvaluan government in partnership with agencies in Australia, the United States and New Caledonia, started with Te Afualiku, Tuvalu’s smallest and most vulnerable island2. Te Afualiku features the most detailed reconstruction, but all nine main islands of Tuvalu, plus its dozens of smaller islands and islets, have now been mapped in three dimensions, and Funafuti has been digitally recreated using drone and street-level imagery.\n\nKitara says there are some concerns around data security and how energy-expensive the exercise is, but “there are good incentives” behind the initiative. “In the worst-case scenario, if every island disappeared, they’ll still exist digitally”, which will help to preserve national identity, culture, government functions, sovereignty and maritime rights, he says. As part of the project, Tuvalu received its first undersea cable, which will boost Internet and mobile connectivity for its residents once completed later this year.\n\nTuvaluans are “pretty vocal” about the need for climate action, Kitara says. But the impacts won’t stop at Tuvalu’s shores. “We’re all in the same boat,” says Kitara. “If we address the issue, it’s a win for us Tuvaluans, but also a win for everyone.” — Sandy Ong\n\nHANNAH EISLER BURNETT: Flood watcher\n\nHannah Eisler Burnett knows first-hand the stresses of living in a flood-prone location. Having grown up on the Gulf coast of Mississippi in the southern United States, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Burnett has dedicated her career to helping coastal communities build resilience to flooding caused by high tides, storm surges and groundwater inundation.\n\n“Flood resilience comes from a variety of sources” beyond raising roads or elevating houses and flood-proofing basements, says Burnett. Behavioural changes such as organizing one’s neighbours to help clear a storm drain before a heavy rain event and building makeshift elevated paths through flood-prone areas are also important.\n\n“In several of the communities I work with, one or two people are central for communicating ahead of potential flooding through e-mail, Whatsapp or Facebook groups, helping people understand what the local impacts of a high-tide flood or heavy rain might be,” says Burnett, an anthropologist at New York Sea Grant, an initiative run by the State University of New York and Cornell University. The programme is one of 34 government–university partnerships that link coastal research with community needs in the United States.\n\nNew York City, where Burnett now lives, is also vulnerable to flooding. Climate change is driving more frequent and intense hurricanes in the Atlantic, which is increasing the risk of major storm-driven flooding in the city. The water that flanks it has risen about 30 cm since 1900 — a rate twice the global average — and is projected to rise by just under 200 cm by 2100. Researchers have estimated that storm-driven flooding events could become up to four times more common along the US east coast, which puts 2.2 million New Yorkers in low-lying neighbourhoods such as Queens and southern Brooklyn at risk.\n\nA core part of Burnett’s work involves building and maintaining a public database of flood photos called MyCoast for the Community Flood Watch Project, run by Sea Grant and the Science and Resilience Institute at Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn. The pictures, which are taken by members of the public across New York state, are used by the US National Weather Service to inform its messaging to local flood-management officials.\n\n“The photos from MyCoast helped them understand that tidal/coastal flooding is more widespread than previously thought,” says Burnett. She adds that the database also provided “a big impetus” for policymakers in New York City to install 500 flood sensors across all five of the city’s boroughs in 2022, after realizing their value in early flood prediction.\n\nAn image of a flooded street in Howard Beach, New York, submitted in 2024 to the MyCoast website, a tool for reporting coastal events such as storms and floods in selected US states.Credit: Theresa Miller/MyCoast\n\nLast year, Burnett helped launch the Jamaica Bay Community Flood Fellowship Program, which provides a platform for leaders from different neighbourhoods in and around Jamaica Bay — a large coastal estuary on the southern edge of Brooklyn and Queens — to collaborate on solutions to chronic flooding. She also helps to familiarize community members with resources such as tide tables, which display the predicted times and heights of tides at specific coastal locations.\n\nBurnett says it can be hard to convince some decision-makers that local insights — such as photos and interviews — are important in flood prediction. “A sensor can measure one thing, but a flood is something that’s happening in multiple dimensions,” she says.\n\nAt the same time, she praises how “innovative and clear-eyed” many residents, researchers and government agencies are when it comes to coastal resilience work. “New York City is a city of immigrants, who bring knowledge of flooding from many parts of the world and apply that knowledge in different ways,” says Burnett.

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nScotland took its next step toward reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, releasing a sweeping draft climate action plan that outlines how the country intends to reduce emissions across transportation, energy, agriculture, and land use over the next two decades. While supporters see the plan as a reaffirmation of Scotland’s climate leadership, critics argue that more detail and clearer commitments are urgently needed.\n\nA renewed push for climate progress\n\nClimate Action Secretary Gillian Martin stressed the urgency of the moment when presenting the draft plan to the Scottish Parliament. She noted that Scotland is already experiencing the impacts of global warming, including flooding, heatwaves, and wildfires. “Parliament has to act,” she said, pointing to what she described as Scotland’s “massive untapped potential” in renewable energy.\n\nThe strategy spans the period through 2040, five years before Scotland pledged to effectively eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. It reaffirms a major shift away from fossil fuels: phasing out the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030 and transitioning homes and commercial buildings to low-carbon heat systems by 2045.\n\nTransforming how Scotland heats and moves\n\nOne of the largest pieces of the plan focuses on how people heat their homes. The government proposes requiring non-domestic buildings to connect to expanded low-carbon district heating networks, and encourages homeowners to shift away from oil and gas boilers.\n\nTransportation remains a major area of change, too. The government plans to offer incentives that make electric vehicles more accessible to drivers and expand infrastructure to support them. The strategy also pledges to increase Scotland’s woodland planting to 18,000 hectares annually by 2029-30.\n\nRestoring landscapes to balance emissions\n\nAgriculture remains Scotland’s third-largest source of emissions, and earlier recommendations suggested that reducing cattle numbers would be necessary to meet targets. However, the government has committed to maintaining livestock levels.\n\nTo help balance this, the plan calls for accelerated peatland restoration. Much of Scotland’s peatlands are in degraded condition and release carbon rather than store it. The government aims to restore roughly one-fifth of these areas (about 400,000 hectares) by 2032. This will require significant long-term investment and planning.\n\nThese measures are combined with faster decarbonisation of fuel supplies, including expanding wind and solar generation. Martin emphasized the need for a “just transition” that supports oil and gas workers as the economy shifts toward green industries.\n\nA costly plan with long-term benefits\n\nThe government estimates that implementing the plan will cost £4.8 billion (roughly $6.3 billion) between 2026 and 2040. However, it projects that the benefits, which include job creation, lower emissions, and warmer homes, could total more than £42 billion (roughly $55.3 billion).\n\nCritics call for clearer details\n\nParties across the political spectrum have responded with skepticism. Scottish Conservative spokesperson Douglas Lumsden argued that the plan “rehashes existing policies” and does not address concerns about the costs of transitioning to electric vehicles and heat pumps.\n\nLabour MSP Sarah Boyack called for more robust plans to retrofit homes and help local authorities build green jobs. Green MSP Patrick Harvie said the government is “years behind” on climate action and criticized what he sees as a lack of clarity on fossil fuel extraction.\n\nEnvironmental groups also raised concerns. Friends of the Earth Scotland said the plan would “barely scratch the surface” of what is needed to support households, improve public transit access, and provide security for workers in transitioning industries.\n\nA nation navigating competing pressures\n\nScotland has already reduced its emissions by more than 50 percent since 1990. However, the government has struggled to meet annual and interim targets, and recently shifted to a system of five-year carbon budgets instead.\n\nThe plan’s success now hinges on how it is implemented. A public consultation is open until 29 January, after which the strategy will return to parliament for approval.\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing economic realities, political pressures, and the scale of climate change itself. As Martin noted, Scotland has the resources to reshape its energy future, but doing so will require coordination, community support, and long-term commitment.",

      "personality_title": "Iran begins cloud seeding to fight severe drought and revive drying lake",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Iran is facing its worst drought in decades, causing its largest lake, Urmia, to dry up and water levels across the country to drop to record lows. Rainfall has decreased by nearly 90%, leading to serious water shortages, especially in Tehran and the northwest.\n\n**What happened** – In response, Iran started cloud seeding flights over Urmia Lake and nearby provinces. Cloud seeding is a method where special particles are sprayed into clouds to encourage rain. Iran announced last year it created its own technology to do this. These operations began in September 2025 and have already helped bring rain to several western regions.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time Iran is actively using its homegrown cloud seeding technology on such a large scale. It aims to increase rainfall and help refill lakes and reservoirs that are dangerously low. This effort could ease water shortages in heavily populated areas, reduce the risk of forced evacuations, and support agriculture and daily life.\n\n**What’s next step** – Iran plans to continue cloud seeding flights in East and West Azerbaijan provinces and possibly expand to other areas. Scientists and officials will monitor the rain results closely to improve the technology and its effectiveness in battling drought.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Iran’s new cloud seeding program using locally developed technology is a practical step to increase rainfall and combat a severe drought threatening the country’s water supply and environment.",
