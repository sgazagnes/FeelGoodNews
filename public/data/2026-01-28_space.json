      "title": "Strange white rocks on Mars hint at millions of years of rain",
      "summary": "Bright white rocks spotted by NASA’s Perseverance rover are rewriting what we thought we knew about ancient Mars. These aluminum-rich clays, called kaolinite, usually form on Earth only after millions of years of heavy rainfall in warm, humid environments—conditions similar to tropical rainforests. Their presence on today’s cold, dry Mars suggests the planet once had abundant rain, flowing water, and possibly lush oases long ago. Even more puzzling, the rocks are scattered across the landscape with no obvious source nearby, hinting at dramatic ancient events like floods, river transport, or asteroid impacts.",
      "content": "Small, pale rocks scattered across Mars' reddish surface are offering fresh clues that parts of the planet may once have been far wetter than they are today. These light-colored spots stand out sharply against the surrounding terrain and suggest that some regions of Mars once hosted humid environments with frequent rainfall, similar to tropical areas on Earth.\n\nNASA's Perseverance rover identified the rocks as kaolinite clay, a white, aluminum-rich material. On Earth, kaolinite forms only after rocks and sediments are stripped of most other minerals through prolonged exposure to water. This process typically requires millions of years of persistent rainfall in warm, wet climates.\n\nStudy Links Rare Clay to Long-Term Rainfall\n\nThe research was published in the peer-reviewed journal Communications Earth & Environment. The study was led by Adrian Broz, a postdoctoral research associate at Purdue University working in the lab of Briony Horgan. Horgan serves as a long-term planner on NASA's Perseverance rover mission and is a professor of planetary science in Purdue's Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences.\n\n\"Elsewhere on Mars, rocks like these are probably some of the most important outcrops we've seen from orbit because they are just so hard to form,\" Horgan said. \"You need so much water that we think these could be evidence of an ancient warmer and wetter climate where there was rain falling for millions of years.\"\n\nBroz explained that on Earth, kaolinite is most commonly found in tropical environments such as rainforests, where heavy rainfall drives intense chemical weathering.\n\n\"So when you see kaolinite on a place like Mars, where it's barren, cold and with certainly no liquid water at the surface, it tells us that there was once a lot more water than there is today,\" said Broz, a postdoctoral collaborator on the Perseverance rover.\n\nRover Instruments Reveal Clues to Mars' Climate History\n\nThe kaolinite pieces observed by Perseverance range in size from small pebbles to large boulders. While modest in scale, they contribute important evidence to the ongoing debate over what Mars was like billions of years ago. The rover's SuperCam and Mastcam-Z instruments were used to analyze the rocks and compare them with similar materials found on Earth.\n\nThese Martian samples could help scientists better understand the environmental changes Mars experienced over time and how the planet transitioned from a wetter world to the dry landscape seen today.\n\nA Geological Mystery in Jezero Crater\n\nDespite their importance, the origin of these light-colored rocks remains unclear. Horgan noted that there is no obvious nearby source where the kaolinite could have formed, even though the fragments appear scattered along the rover's path since it landed in Jezero crater in February 2021. Scientists believe the crater once held a lake roughly twice the size of Lake Tahoe.\n\n\"They're clearly recording an incredible water event, but where did they come from?\" Horgan said. \"Maybe they were washed into Jezero's lake by the river that formed the delta, or maybe they were thrown into Jezero by an impact and they're just scattered there. We're not totally sure.\"\n\nSatellite data has revealed large kaolinite deposits elsewhere on Mars, but Perseverance has not yet reached those locations.\n\n\"But until we can actually get to these large outcroppings with the rover, these small rocks are our only on-the-ground evidence for how these rocks could have formed,\" Horgan said. \"And right now the evidence in these rocks really points toward these kinds of ancient warmer and wetter environments.\"\n\nEarth Comparisons Strengthen the Case\n\nTo better understand how the Martian kaolinite formed, Broz compared the rover data with rock samples collected near San Diego, California, and in South Africa. The chemical signatures of the Earth and Mars samples closely matched.\n\nBroz noted that kaolinite can also form through hydrothermal processes on Earth, where hot water alters rock underground. However, this method leaves behind a distinct chemical pattern that differs from the signature created by long-term exposure to rain at cooler temperatures. Data from three separate sites were used to evaluate whether hydrothermal activity could explain the Martian samples, and the results favored rainfall as the most likely cause.\n\nA Time Capsule for Habitability\n\nKaolinite and similar rocks on Mars act as geological records, preserving information about environmental conditions from billions of years ago. These materials offer rare insight into whether Mars once had settings capable of supporting life.\n\n\"All life uses water,\" Broz said. \"So when we think about the possibility of these rocks on Mars representing a rainfall-driven environment, that is a really incredible, habitable place where life could have thrived if it were ever on Mars.\"",

Mars today is cold and dry, but scientists have long wondered if it was once warmer and wetter.\n\n**What happened** – The rover found bright white rocks made of a clay called kaolinite. On Earth, kaolinite forms only after millions of years of heavy rainfall in warm, humid places like tropical rainforests. These rocks on Mars suggest that long ago, the planet experienced similar conditions with regular rain and flowing water. The rocks are scattered in the crater with no clear source nearby, hinting they may have been moved by floods, rivers, or even asteroid impacts.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because kaolinite requires a lot of water and time to form. Finding it on Mars means the planet once had a climate very different from today’s dry surface. It gives scientists new clues about how Mars changed over billions of years and where to look for signs of ancient life. The rocks act like a natural time capsule, showing that parts of Mars could have supported living things.\n\n**What's next step** – Perseverance will continue to study these rocks and search for larger kaolinite deposits elsewhere on Mars.

Sur Terre, la kaolinite ne se forme qu’après des millions d’années de fortes pluies dans des environnements chauds et humides, comme les forêts tropicales. Ces roches sur Mars suggèrent qu’autrefois, la planète connaissait des conditions similaires avec des pluies régulières et de l’eau en mouvement. Les roches sont dispersées dans le cratère sans source évidente, ce qui laisse penser qu’elles ont été déplacées par des inondations, des rivières ou même des impacts d’astéroïdes.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte est importante car la kaolinite nécessite beaucoup d’eau et beaucoup de temps pour se former. La trouver sur Mars signifie que la planète avait autrefois un climat très différent de la surface sèche d’aujourd’hui. Cela donne aux scientifiques de nouveaux indices sur la façon dont Mars a changé au cours de milliards d’années et sur les endroits où chercher des signes de vie ancienne. Ces roches agissent comme une capsule temporelle naturelle, montrant que certaines zones de Mars pouvaient abriter la vie.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Perseverance continuera d’étudier ces roches et cherchera des dépôts plus importants de kaolinite ailleurs sur Mars.

Information from the cold-flow test series is instrumental in understanding the operational characteristics and fluid flow performance of nuclear reactors.”\n\nTeams at the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, conducted more than 100 tests on the engineering development unit over several months in 2025. The 44-inch by 72-inch unit, built by BWX Technologies of Richmond, Virginia, is a full-scale, non-nuclear, flight-like development test article the size of a 100-gallon drum that simulates propellant flow throughout the reactor across a range of operational conditions.\n\nThe cold-flow tests at NASA Marshall are the culmination of a multi-year activity for the agency and its industry partners. Key test objectives included simulating operational fluid-dynamic responses, gathering critical information for design of the flight instrumentation and control system, providing crucial validation of analytical tools, and serving as a pathfinder for manufacturing, assembly, and integration of near-term flight-capable nuclear propulsion systems.\n\nOther benefits to space travel include increasing the science payload capacity and higher power for instrumentation and communication.\n\nTest engineers were able to demonstrate that the reactor design is not susceptible to destructive flow-induced oscillations, vibrations or pressure waves that occur when a moving fluid interacts with a structure in a way that makes the system shake.\n\n“We’re doing more than proving a new technology,” said Jason Turpin, manager of the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office at NASA Marshall. “This test series generated some of the most detailed flow responses for a flight-like space reactor design in more than 50 years and is a key steppingstone toward developing a flight-capable system. Each milestone brings us closer to expanding what’s possible for the future of human spaceflight, exploration, and science.”\n\nThe Space Nuclear Propulsion Office is part of NASA’s Technology Demonstration Missions Program within the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate.\n\nLearn more about NASA’s technology advancements:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/space-technology-mission-directorate/\n\nNews Media Contact\n\nJoel Wallace\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama\n\n256-544-0034\n\njoel.w.wallace@nasa.gov",

      "content": "This image from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, containing nearly 800,000 galaxies, is overlaid with a map of dark matter, represented in blue. Brighter blue areas indicate a higher density of dark matter. Researchers used Webb data to find the dark matter — which is invisible — via its gravitational influence on regular matter.\n\nThe area of sky shown here is 0.54 square degrees (about 2½ times the size of the full Moon) and located in the constellation Sextans. Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) peered at this region for a total of about 255 hours.\n\nDark matter doesn’t emit, reflect, absorb, or even block light, and is therefore not visible to the human eye or traditional telescopes. But it does interact with the universe through gravity, and large clumps or clusters of dark matter have enough mass to curve space itself. Light traveling to Earth from distant galaxies becomes slightly distorted as it passes through the curved fabric of spacetime. In some cases, the warping is significant enough that it is apparent to the naked eye, almost as if the galaxy were being viewed through a warped windowpane, an effect called strong gravitational lensing. In the case of the dark matter map shown here, scientists inferred dark matter’s distribution by relying instead on an effect called weak gravitational lensing, which leads to much more subtle distortions of the light from thousands of galaxies.\n\nThe dark matter in this area of sky was also mapped in 2007 using data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. The Webb map contains about 10 times more galaxies than do maps of the area made by ground-based observatories and twice as many as Hubble’s map. It reveals new clumps of dark matter and captures a higher-resolution view compared to the Hubble map.\n\nBoth the Hubble and Webb dark matter maps are part of a project called the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). The full COSMOS “field” is 2 square degrees (about 10 times the size of the full Moon) and has been imaged by at least 15 telescopes in space and on the ground. Observing the same region with many different telescopes allows scientists to combine complementary views to understand how galaxies grow and how dark matter influences their evolution. Only Webb and Hubble data have been used to map dark matter in the region.\n\nTo refine measurements of the distance to many galaxies for the map, the team used Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), designed and managed through launch by the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, along with other space- and ground-based telescopes. The wavelengths that MIRI detects also make it adept at detecting galaxies obscured by cosmic dust clouds.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).\n\nWebb’s MIRI was developed through a 50-50 partnership between NASA and ESA. A division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, JPL led the U.S. contribution to MIRI. JPL also led development of MIRI’s cryocooler, done in collaboration with Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, California, and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nTo learn more about Webb, visit: https://science.nasa.gov/webb",

      "content": "A team of astronomers has employed a cutting-edge, artificial intelligence-assisted technique to uncover rare astronomical phenomena within archived data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. The team analyzed nearly 100 million image cutouts from the Hubble Legacy Archive, each measuring just a few dozen pixels (7 to 8 arcseconds) on a side. They identified more than 1,300 objects with an odd appearance in just two and a half days — more than 800 of which had never been documented in scientific literature.\n\nMost of the anomalies were galaxies undergoing mergers or interactions, which exhibit unusual morphologies or trailing, elongated streams of stars and gas. Others were gravitational lenses, where the gravity of a foreground galaxy distorts spacetime and bends light from a background galaxy into arcs or rings. Additional discoveries included galaxies with massive star-forming clumps, jellyfish-looking galaxies with gaseous “tentacles,” and edge-on planet-forming disks in our own galaxy resembling hamburgers. Remarkably, several dozen objects defied existing classification schemes entirely.\n\nIdentifying such a diverse array of rare objects within the vast and growing repository of Hubble and other telescope data presents a formidable challenge. Never in the history of astronomy has such a volume of observational data been available for analysis.\n\nTo address this challenge, researchers David O’Ryan and Pablo Gómez of ESA (the European Space Agency) developed an AI tool capable of inspecting millions of astronomical images in a fraction of the time required by human experts. Their neural network, named AnomalyMatch, was trained to detect rare and unusual objects by recognizing patterns in data — mimicking the way the human brain processes visual information.\n\nSix previously undiscovered, weird, and fascinating astrophysical objects are displayed in this new image from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. They include three lenses with arcs distorted by gravity, one galactic merger, one ring galaxy, and one galaxy that defied classification.

While expert astronomers excel at identifying unusual features, the sheer volume of Hubble data makes comprehensive manual review impractical. Citizen science initiatives have helped expand the scope of data analysis, but even these efforts fall short when faced with archives as extensive as Hubble’s or those from wide-field survey telescopes like Euclid, an ESA mission with NASA contributions.\n\nThe work by O’Ryan and Gómez represents a significant advancement. By applying AnomalyMatch to the Hubble Legacy Archive, they conducted the first systematic search for astrophysical anomalies across the entire dataset. After the algorithm flagged likely candidates, the researchers manually reviewed the top-rated sources and confirmed more than 1,300 as true anomalies.\n\n“This is a powerful demonstration of how AI can enhance the scientific return of archival datasets,” Gómez said. “The discovery of so many previously undocumented anomalies in Hubble data underscores the tool’s potential for future surveys.”\n\nHubble is just one of many astronomical archives poised to benefit from AI-driven analysis. Facilities such as NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, a well as ESA’s Euclid and the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy’s Vera C. Rubin Observatory, will generate unprecedented volumes of data. Tools like AnomalyMatch will be essential for navigating this data deluge, enabling astronomers to uncover new and unexpected phenomena — and perhaps even objects never before seen in the universe.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope has been operating for over three decades and continues to make ground-breaking discoveries that shape our fundamental understanding of the universe. Hubble is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the telescope and mission operations. Lockheed Martin Space, based in Denver, also supports mission operations at Goddard. The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, conducts Hubble science operations for NASA.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The Hubble Space Telescope has collected images of space for more than 35 years. These images are stored in a large archive containing millions of small pictures showing stars, galaxies, and other cosmic objects. Searching through this huge amount of data to find unusual or interesting objects is very difficult for humans.\n\n**What happened** – Two astronomers from the European Space Agency (ESA), David O’Ryan and Pablo Gómez, created an artificial intelligence (AI) tool called AnomalyMatch. This AI quickly scanned nearly 100 million small images from the Hubble Legacy Archive. In just two and a half days, it found more than 1,300 strange and rare objects, including over 800 that scientists had never seen or described before.\n\n**Impact** – The discoveries include galaxies merging together, strange star formations, and unusual gravitational effects that bend light. Some objects even did not fit into known categories. This is the first time AI has been used to systematically search the entire Hubble archive for such anomalies. It shows how AI can help scientists find new things much faster than before, especially as space telescopes collect more and more data.\n\n**What's next step** – The AI tool will be used to study data from upcoming space telescopes like NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, ESA’s Euclid, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. These new telescopes will produce huge amounts of images, and AI will be essential to find rare or unexpected cosmic objects among them.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – An AI tool has rapidly uncovered over 1,300 rare cosmic phenomena in decades of Hubble data, opening new paths for discovery in astronomy’s big data era.",
