      "summary": "A photosynthetic bacterium shows a surprising ability to absorb persistent PFAS chemicals, offering a glimpse into biological tools that might one day tackle toxic contamination. Researchers are now exploring genetic and synthetic biology approaches to enhance these early signs of PFAS-handling potential.",
      "content": "Scientists working in the labs of Rajib Saha and Nirupam Aich have found that a widespread photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, can interact with perfluorooctanoic acid, a highly resistant member of the PFAS family. Their study, published in Environmental Science: Advances, reports that the bacterium draws PFOA into its cell membrane -- a behavior that changes over time.\n\nThis discovery offers an early look at how natural microbes might eventually be guided or engineered to help reduce PFAS pollution, potentially supporting efforts to protect water quality and public health.\n\nEarly Experiments Reveal Promise and Limitations\n\nDuring controlled lab tests, the researchers noted that R. palustris removed about 44% of PFOA from its surroundings within 20 days. Much of that absorbed chemical later returned to the environment, most likely because the cells broke apart -- a result that underscores both the usefulness and the challenges of relying on living microorganisms to capture or alter PFAS.\n\n\"While R. palustris didn't completely degrade the chemical, our findings suggest a stepwise mechanism where the bacterium may initially trap PFOA in its membranes,\" said Saha, Richard L. and Carol S. McNeel Associate Professor. \"This gives us a foundation to explore future genetic or systems biology interventions that could improve retention or even enable biotransformation.\"\n\nCollaborative Expertise Strengthens the Research\n\nThe Aich Lab provided specialized PFAS detection capabilities, allowing the team to track changes in PFOA levels with high accuracy. At the same time, Saha's group carried out the biological experiments and examined how the bacterium responded to different PFAS concentrations.\n\n\"This kind of collaboration is exactly what's needed to address complex environmental challenges,\" said Aich, Richard L. McNeel Associate Professor. \"By bringing together microbiology, chemical engineering, and environmental analytical science, we're gaining a more complete picture of how to tackle PFAS pollution with biological tools.\"\n\nToward Scalable Microbial Approaches for PFAS Cleanup\n\nPFAS compounds remain a worldwide issue because they persist in soil and water for long periods. Existing treatments can be expensive and require significant energy. Microbial strategies may offer a more adaptable and less resource-intensive path forward -- although substantial scientific development is still necessary.\n\nThe findings from this project point toward that direction, and the research teams are already planning additional studies focused on microbial engineering and synthetic biology to improve future degradation capabilities.\n\nFunding and Access to Findings\n\nThis collaborative effort was supported by Layman Award and Nebraska Collaboration Initiative Grant Awarded to Aich and Saha. Two doctoral candidates -- Mark Kathol from Saha Lab and Anika Azme from Aich Lab -- are the two co-first authors of this study.\n\nThe full study is available open-access via the Royal Society of Chemistry.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – PFAS are man-made chemicals that last a very long time in the environment. They are found in many places, including water, and are hard to remove because they don’t break down easily. Scientists are looking for new ways to clean up these harmful chemicals.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers discovered that a common photosynthetic bacterium called Rhodopseudomonas palustris can take in one type of PFAS chemical called PFOA. In lab tests, the bacterium absorbed about 44% of PFOA in 20 days by trapping it in its cell membrane. However, some of the chemical was released back when the cells broke down.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it shows that natural microbes might help reduce PFAS pollution. Unlike some costly or energy-heavy methods, using bacteria could provide a simpler way to clean water and soil. The study also highlights challenges, like the bacteria not fully breaking down the chemicals yet.\n\n**What’s next step** – Scientists plan to use genetic and synthetic biology techniques to improve how these bacteria hold onto or even break down PFAS chemicals. Further research will test if these methods can be scaled up to help clean the environment more effectively.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A common bacterium has been found to absorb persistent PFAS chemicals, opening a path for future biological methods to reduce toxic pollution.",

      "title": "Extended Producer Responsibility In 2025: Progress, With More To Come",
      "summary": "The landscape of packaging waste management continued to evolve for the better in 2025, as...\nThe post Extended Producer Responsibility In 2025: Progress, With More To Come appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "The landscape of packaging waste management continued to evolve for the better in 2025, as two more states enacted Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws and the first operational programs moved from planning to enforcement.\n\nWith Maryland and Washington joining the ranks, according to the Product Stewardship Institute, seven U.S. states now require companies that manufacture, distribute, or sell packaged products to bear financial and operational responsibility for the end-of-life management of that packaging. The expansion represents a fundamental restructuring of who pays for recycling infrastructure, shifting costs from municipalities and taxpayers to producers of packaging materials that have often gone unrecycled.\n\n\n\nEPR laws require companies that manufacture, import, or brand packaged products to fund the collection, sorting, and recycling of those materials after consumers discard them. Peoducers pay into nonprofit Producer Responsibility Organizations (PROs) that in turn reimburse local governments and invest in recycling infrastructure improvements. The policy creates financial incentives for producers to reduce packaging volume, increase use of recycled content, and design easy-to-recycle or compostable products.\n\nFrom Legislation to Implementation\n\nMaryland’s SB 901, which became law in May, is unique because it allows multiple PROs to operate programs while incentivizing the use of recyclable, reusable, or compostable packaging.\n\nWashington’s EPR program, also signed into law in May, will require capturing consumer packaging while expanding collection services to reach hundreds of thousands of homes not currently served by curbside recycling. The Evergreen State’s compliance deadlines for producers to participate are in 2028.\n\nIn addition to these comprehensive EPR programs, several states advanced legislation. Hawaii has enacted HB 750, which calls for an EPR needs assessment by the state’s Department of Health to determine requirements for implementing an EPR program. The results are due to the legislature by the end of 2027. Meanwhile, Rhode Island passed a similar needs assessment bill in June.\n\nMaine, which passed the nation’s first packaging EPR law in 2021, amended its rules. The updated EPR law includes exemptions designed to protect small businesses: Producers with less than $5 million in gross annual revenue are exempt for the first three years (dropping to $2 million thereafter), as are those selling less than one ton of packaging annually in the state. Maine also gave a break to perishable food producers with less than 15 tons of packaging, as well as to nonprofit organizations and businesses primarily selling salvage or closeout goods, which are also exempt, along with beverage containers already covered under the state’s bottle bill, paint containers with high recycling rates, and packaging for federally regulated products such as medical devices and hazardous materials.\n\nIn 2025, Connecticut passed HB 5019, establishing producer responsibility for consumer batteries, while Nebraska enacted LB36, the Safe Battery Collection and Recycling Act.\n\nOregon Breaks Ground as First Operational Program\n\nOregon’s controversial program officially began implementation on July 1, 2025, when PRO membership fees were due and enforcement—including noncompliance penalties of up to $25,000 per day—went into effect. More than 2,000 producers registered and received their first invoices from the state government, marking the first time U.S. packaging producers paid into a comprehensive EPR system.\n\nOregon’s transition exposed significant challenges.\n\n“How do I know if I’m foodservice? How do I know which covered materials are part of the program?” said Jeff Fielkow, CEO of the Circular Action Alliance (CAA), the PRO leading producer programs in five states. “This was a massive learning curve,” he told Packaging World.\n\nNavigating the State-by-State Patchwork\n\nThe seven states with comprehensive EPR packaging laws—Maine, Oregon, Colorado, California, Minnesota, Maryland, and Washington—each operate on their own timelines with different requirements. The lack of consistent rules in the states has presented challenges.\n\nCalifornia: Even though the regulations are not finalized, qualifying producers in the state were required to submit 2023 baseline packaging data, including total supplied weight and weight of plastic components across 94 Covered Material Categories by packaging material type, form, and plastic content. Beginning in January 2027, companies that do not comply with the rules will be fined up to $50,000 per day for failing to meet California’s requirements.\n\nColorado: Producers were required to register with CAA, the state’s packaging PRO, by October 1, 2024, and submit initial supply reports by the end of this past July. Colorado’s fees will take effect beginning in January 2026.\n\nMinnesota: The state also selected CAA as its PRO in February. Producer registration was required by July 1, 2025. Now, PROs must submit their first comprehensive stewardship plans to the state by October 1, 2028.\n\nLegislation Stalls in Key States\n\nDespite the momentum, several states saw EPR bills fail to advance in 2025. New York’s S 1464 made significant progress but ultimately stalled on the floor. New Jersey’s S 3398, introduced in 2024, was considered by Senate and Assembly committees in 2025, but did not pass.\n\nTennessee’s SB 269 and HB 600, the Tennessee Waste to Jobs Act, failed for the second consecutive year.\n\nNebraska’s LB 607, which would require producers to report packaging recycling and management data to the public, was last discussed by legislators in February and remains in legislative limbo.\n\n146 Laws Across 21 Product Categories\n\nWhile packaging EPR has dominated recent legislative activity, it represents only one segment of a broader producer responsibility movement. According to the Product Stewardship Institute, its expert testimony and model legislation have helped enact 146 EPR laws in 35 states across 21 product categories, including packaging, protecting 1.3 billion acres of land and 272 million people.\n\nThe Circular Action Alliance is currently the only organization approved to implement EPR laws for paper and packaging in California, Colorado, Oregon, Minnesota, and Maryland, providing an increasingly streamlined compliance pathway that could standardize rules.\n\nWhat’s Ahead In 2026?\n\nPackaging EPR in the United States is here to stay and is poised to take hold in new states every year. More states are pursuing EPR legislation in the absence of a comprehensive federal program, and these trends will likely continue and expand. The shift from municipal waste management to producer responsibility represents a permanent restructuring of the recycling economy—one that requires immediate attention to data systems, packaging design, and compliance infrastructure.",

Yet one influential hub that was not present at the conference, though it continues to reshape climate justice discourse across Nigeria through feminist action, is the Women Initiative for Sustainable Development (WISE).\n\nWISE challenges the elitism of climate talks, centering lived experiences, and aims to build collective power across borders. They offer a critical counterbalance to top-down, often exclusionary international negotiations. This hub aims to foster community-driven solutions, amplify feminist demands, and ensure that feminist principles of care and solidarity shape the climate agenda.\n\nIn an interview with its founding director, Olanike Olugboji-Daramola, offers more insight into the hub’s work, emphasizing that climate justice is not only about being represented at spaces like COP30 — it is about transforming the conversation altogether, starting from the grassroots.\n\nZita Zage (ZZ): Can you tell us about yourself?\n\nOlanike Olugboji-Daramola (OOD): My name is Olanike Olugboji-Daramola, the founding Director of WISE. I am a multi-award-winning conservationist, climate justice actor, women’s empowerment advocate, citizen journalist, public speaker and writer. In addition to directing WISE, I serve as Women’s Earth Alliance (WEA)’s Nigeria Project Lead and a correspondent for World Pulse, where I speaks on critical issues like climate change. My writing has been featured in Time Magazine, and I am involved in a number of leadership and global initiatives, like the Inclusive Global Leadership Institute, How Women Lead/Women Leaders for the World, Empowerment Institute USA, Clean Cooking Alliance and others.\n\nZZ: Can you tell us about the Women Initiative for Sustainable Development (WISE)? When was it established, and for what purpose?\n\nOOD: Inspired by my care for nature and unique sense of equity, I founded the Environmental Management and Protection Network (EMPRONET) in 2004. In 2009, EMPRONET transitioned to Women Initiative for Sustainable Environment (WISE), a legally registered nonprofit organization that advances grassroots women’s representation, active participation, and leadership in natural resource governance and peace building. Through WISE, we lobby individuals, governmental and intergovernmental bodies, NGOs, Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and other individuals and corporate organizations to develop environmentally sustainable initiatives that socially and economically empower women. To date, our efforts have directly impacted over 150,000 women at the grassroots, significantly enhancing their roles in natural resource management and sustainable development.\n\nZZ: The UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) just ended. Did WISE participate in this conference or has it participated in previous editions?\n\nOOD: With funding support received from Global Fund for Women, our organization, Women Initiative for Sustainable Environment, organized what was termed a Pre-COP28 Awareness rally in Kaduna state Nigeria to demand for climate justice for women and affirmative representation at the 28th edition of the UN Climate Change Conference. The rally was organized ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference also referred to as the Conference of Parties (COP 28) scheduled to hold from November 30 to December 12 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The goal of the rally was to demand for climate justice for women and affirmative participation at the Conference of Parties (COP). The rally was also intended for the purpose of creating awareness, as many people were not informed about the terrible impacts of climate change in their communities. Similarly, many residents do not know anything about COP. I have heard so many leaders saying that women are the most impacted by the effect of climate change and they are the first responders, but sadly, at the decision-making tables, their voices are missing. The concerns of women need to be heard as it concerns climate change, because so many women in Nigeria are still using firewood to cook. It is one of the greatest causes of deforestation thus contributing to the spate of invasive deforestation.\n\nZZ: What are some of Nigeria’s climate plans that women have contributed to or advocated for?\n\nOOD: While women have historically been underrepresented in high-level policy discussions, their involvement in climate policy-making has been a growing priority in Nigeria. In recent years, especially, women in Nigeria are having more opportunities to play pivotal roles in shaping climate plans and programs at the national and local levels specifically through extensive consultations, inclusive plan development and Integration into national policies, and ongoing key women-led initiatives which are ensuring women’s participation in strategic efforts. From policy and program design to formulation, implementation and reporting, most notably through the National Action Plan on Gender and Climate Change which is a strategy, launched in 2020, aimed at ensuring climate policies and programs are inclusive of all genders and vulnerable groups. These efforts reflect a recognition that women are disproportionately affected by climate change and possess valuable knowledge and skills necessary for effective climate action and resilience-building.\n\nZZ: Can you share with us some key takeaways from your recent events: the book reading, farm visit, and small holder dialogue?\n\nOOD: On Friday, November 21st, we organized a Book Reading session as part of the Nigerian Resistance Hub for Climate Justice, themed “COP Missing Voices.” This event brought women and young females together to unpack and reflect on the emotional, social, and economic effects of floods on rural women farmers. In small breakout group discussions, participants openly explored how climate-induced flooding reinforces burdens such as:\n\nLoss of property and livelihoods\n\nForced migration and displacement\n\nEmotional and psychological trauma\n\nFinancial loss and indebtedness\n\nIncreased disease exposure\n\nDisruption of family stability and food security\n\nThe conversations also shifted toward solutions — what communities and policymakers can do to ease these burdens and build resilience. Key recommendations shared included:\n\nProper drainage systems and improved waste management\n\nCommunity advocacy and awareness programs\n\nStronger enforcement of environmental sanitation\n\nCompensation mechanisms for affected communities\n\nTree planting and environmentally friendly policies\n\nStricter laws against illegal felling of trees\n\nConstruction of dams and flood-control structures\n\nTraining for women on constructive response techniques\n\nEnlightenment on insurance policies to reduce financial shock\n\nTo witness firsthand the adverse effects of climate change on the lives of women farmers, we embarked on a walk to the farm. During this farm visit, one woman, Madam Elizabeth, shared her struggle with how she was forced to plant her corn at least four times this year before the crops could finally stabilize. It is the dry season, but the very soil that sustains her crops is becoming drier than usual, cakey and cracked due to insufficient rainfall and moisture, an alarming sign of drought. This struggle is a growing crisis, especially for rural women farmers whose livelihoods depend entirely on the land.\n\nThe small holder dialogue was among the activities featured in COP30: Nigerian Resistance Hub for Climate Justice — “COP Missing Voices.” During the dialogue, participants engaged in a roundtable discussion, sharing firsthand experiences on how climate change affects their agricultural production, the challenges of accessing finance and technology, local adaptation successes, and regenerative farming practices. The discussions also generated recommendations and actionable proposals for promoting sustainable agriculture.\n\nZZ: I know you have won several awards. Can you tell us about the ones you are most proud of and why?\n\nOOD: Reflecting on my journey, two awards I am most proud of are being honored as a World Pulse Live Tour Speaker in 2014 and a World Trade Congress Ambassador in 2022. Both awards afforded me advantageous opportunities to speak about Nigerian Women’s struggles with environmental degradation and climate change, while also projecting women-led grassroots solutions championed through WISE, and also making recommendations that I knew were taken into account and amplified. These global platforms amplified my voice beyond Nigeria and provided me with much-needed motivation and support to keep advancing the cause that I remain committed to. Every recognition that has come my way is not just about me, but it echoes the reverberating voices of women who refuse to be sidelined in the climate conversation, the communities that embraced transformation, and the struggles we must continue to surmount together.",
