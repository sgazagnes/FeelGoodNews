      "content": "We are getting a clearer sense of where and how often Homo sapiens and Neanderthals interbred, and it turns out the behaviour was much more common than we first thought\n\nAn artist’s impression of Neanderthal life CHRISTIAN JEGOU/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n\nHomo sapiens and Neanderthals were probably interbreeding over a huge area stretching from western Europe into Asia.\n\nWe have long known that early humans (Homo sapiens) and Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) interbred, which is why most non-African people today have some Neanderthal DNA, typically about 2 per cent of their genome. The interbreeding also saw the Neanderthal Y chromosome lineages replaced by lineages from H. sapiens.\n\nBut where this interbreeding happened and on what kind of scale has long been a mystery, even if we are now starting to get a handle on when it occurred. The ancestors of Neanderthals left Africa about 600,000 years ago, heading into Europe and western Asia. And the earliest evidence of H. sapiens migrating out of Africa is skeletal remains from sites in modern day Israel and Greece, dating back around 200,000 years.\n\nThere are signs that H. sapiens contributed genetically to Neanderthal populations from the Altai mountains in what is now Siberia roughly 100,000 years ago, but the main pulse of their migration out of Africa came after about 60,000 years ago. Two studies from 2024 based on ancient genomes implied that the most gene flow between H. sapiens and Neanderthals happened in a sustained period of between around 4000 and 7000 years, starting about 50,000 years ago.\n\nIt was thought that this probably happened in the eastern Mediterranean region, but the location is hard to pin down.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nTo investigate, Mathias Currat at the University of Geneva in Switzerland and his colleagues have used data from 4147 ancient genetic samples, the oldest being about 44,000 years old, which come from more than 1200 locations. They assessed the proportion of genetic variants from Neanderthal DNA – called introgressed alleles – that have been repeatedly transferred by hybridisation.\n\n“The idea was to see whether it is possible using the patterns of Neanderthal DNA integration in past human genomes to see where integration took place,” says Currat.\n\nThe results show a gradual increase in the proportion of transferred DNA the further you go from the eastern Mediterranean region, which plateaus after about 3900 kilometres both westwards towards Europe and eastwards into Asia.\n\n“We were quite surprised to see a nice increasing pattern of introgression proportion in human genomes resulting from what we guess is the out-of-Africa human expansion,” says Currat. “It’s increasing toward Europe, it’s increasing toward East Asia, and so it allows us to estimate the boundary of this hybrid zone.”\n\nThe researcher’s computer simulations indicate a hybrid zone that covered most of Europe and the eastern Mediterranean and went into western Asia.\n\nThe interbreeding zone between Neanderthals and H. sapiens. The dots represent the location of genetic samples analysed in the study and the triangle shows the possible route H. sapiens took out of Africa Lionel N. Di Santo et al. 2026\n\n“What we see seems to be a single continuous pulse – a continuous series of interbreeding events in space and time,” says Currat. “However, we don’t know when hybridisation took place in the zone.”\n\nThe hybrid zone includes almost all known sites associated with Neanderthal fossils, spanning western Eurasia, except those from the Altai region.\n\n“The finding that the inferred hybrid zone extends broadly into western Eurasia is intriguing and suggests that interactions between populations may have been geographically widespread,” says Leonardo Iasi at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\n\nHowever, the Atlantic fringe, including western France and most of the Iberian peninsula, isn’t in the hybrid zone, despite the well-documented Neanderthal presence there. It could be that there was no hybridisation in this region, says Currat, or that any interbreeding occurring here isn’t represented in the 4147 genetic samples.\n\n“Overall, the study paints a picture of repeated interactions between modern humans and Neanderthals across a broad geographic range and over extended periods of time,” says Iasi, adding that the hybrid zone might extend further, but limited ancient DNA sampling in regions such as the Arabian peninsula makes it difficult to assess how far it went in that direction.\n\n“This is an important paper that challenges the view that there was only one region, probably western Asia, and one Neanderthal population (not represented in the current Neanderthal genetic samples) that hybridised with the Homo sapiens population dispersing from Africa,” says Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London. “As early sapiens spread out in ever-growing numbers and over an ever-expanding range, it seems they mopped up small Neanderthal populations they encountered along the way, across virtually the whole known Neanderthal range.”",

      "personality_title": "New study shows Neanderthals and early humans interbred across a vast region",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have known for some time that early humans, called Homo sapiens, and Neanderthals, a closely related group, interbred. This is why most people outside Africa have some Neanderthal DNA. However, where and how often this mixing happened was unclear.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from the University of Geneva studied 4,147 ancient human DNA samples from over 1,200 locations, some as old as 44,000 years. They looked for Neanderthal DNA mixed into early human genomes to find where interbreeding took place. Their analysis showed that the mixing happened over a large area stretching from western Europe through the eastern Mediterranean and into western Asia.\n\n**Impact** – This finding is important because it shows that Neanderthals and early humans didn’t just meet and mix in one small place but across a wide region for thousands of years. It changes how we understand human history by revealing a broad “hybrid zone” where populations met and shared genes. This helps explain why Neanderthal DNA is found in many people today.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists want to study more ancient DNA from less explored areas like the Arabian Peninsula to see if the hybrid zone was even bigger. They also aim to learn exactly when and how often these interbreeding events happened.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Early humans and Neanderthals interbred repeatedly across much of Europe and Asia, creating a wide area of shared ancestry.\n",

C’est pourquoi la plupart des personnes hors d’Afrique ont de l’ADN néandertalien. Mais on ne savait pas où et à quelle fréquence cela s’est produit.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs de l’Université de Genève ont étudié 4 147 anciens échantillons d’ADN humain provenant de plus de 1 200 endroits, certains vieux de 44 000 ans. Ils ont cherché de l’ADN néandertalien dans les génomes humains anciens pour savoir où les croisements ont eu lieu. Leur analyse montre que ce mélange s’est produit sur une grande zone allant de l’Europe de l’Ouest, en passant par la Méditerranée orientale jusqu’à l’Asie occidentale.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte est importante car elle montre que Néandertaliens et premiers humains ne se sont pas croisés en un seul endroit, mais sur une vaste région pendant des milliers d’années. Cela change notre compréhension de l’histoire humaine en révélant une large « zone hybride » où les populations se sont rencontrées et ont partagé leurs gènes. Cela explique pourquoi l’ADN néandertalien est présent chez beaucoup de personnes aujourd’hui.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques veulent étudier plus d’ADN ancien dans des zones moins explorées comme la péninsule arabique pour voir si cette zone hybride était plus étendue. Ils cherchent aussi à savoir quand et à quelle fréquence ces croisements ont eu lieu.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – Les premiers humains et les Néandertaliens se sont croisés plusieurs fois sur une grande partie de l’Europe et de l’Asie, créant une large zone d’ancêtres communs.\n",
