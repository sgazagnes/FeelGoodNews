      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nOn a balmy evening in Dakar, Imam Ibrahima Diane stood before a circle of men and made a simple but radical point: a good husband does more than provide. He bathes his baby. He helps in the kitchen. He supports his wife.\n\nQuoting scripture, Diane told the group, “The Prophet himself says a man who does not help support his wife and children is not a good Muslim.” Some chuckled, unsure. Others clapped.\n\nThis was no ordinary sermon. Diane was teaching at a “school for husbands,” a United Nations-backed program that trains respected male community leaders in “positive masculinity.” The goal is an honourable one: to bring men into conversations around reproductive health, family planning, and equality… and to save lives in the process.\n\nWhy husbands matter in maternal health\n\nIn many Senegalese households, men have the final say in life-changing decisions: whether a woman can access prenatal care, deliver in a hospital, or use contraception. Those choices directly affect maternal and infant survival.\n\n“Without men’s involvement, attitudes around maternal health won’t change,” said Aida Diouf, a veteran health worker who collaborates with the program.\n\nThe results are striking. Trained men don’t just shift their own behavior; they influence entire communities. One participant, retired army commando Habib Diallo, explained how he convinced his son to take his pregnant wife to a hospital rather than risk a home birth. “At first, he worried about the cost and didn’t trust the hospital. But when I explained how much safer it would be, he agreed.”\n\nFrom patriarchs to partners\n\nThe initiative began in 2011 and has since expanded to more than 20 schools, training over 300 men. It follows similar efforts in Niger, Togo, and Burkina Faso, where engaging men led to higher use of contraceptives, more prenatal care, and more skilled attendants at birth.\n\nIn Senegal, men once known for “barking orders” now lend a hand at home. “My husband used to not do much around the house, just bark orders. Now he actually cooks and helps out with daily tasks,” said 52-year-old Khary Ndeye with a smile.\n\nDiscussions don’t stop at maternal health. The schools also tackle issues such as girls’ education, early marriage, and the dangers of female genital mutilation.\n\nNumbers tell a story of progress — and urgency\n\nMaternal deaths in Senegal have fallen in the last decade, but the country still recorded 237 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2023. That’s far above the U.N.’s 2030 target of 70. Newborn deaths, too, remain stubbornly high at 21 per 1,000 live births.\n\nOne major reason is that too many women still give birth at home without skilled care. “By educating men about the importance of supporting their wives during pregnancy, taking them to the hospital, and helping with domestic work, you’re protecting people’s health,” explained program coordinator El Hadj Malick.\n\nChanging mindsets, one conversation at a time\n\nMalick admits not every conversation is easy. When sessions focus purely on “gender,” some men push back, seeing it as foreign or taboo. “But when we focus on women’s right to be healthy, it puts a human face on the concept and it becomes universal,” he said.\n\nFor many families, the change is transformative. Husbands who once enforced patriarchal norms now advocate for equality and model care for others. Communities that resisted family planning now embrace it as a tool for survival and well-being.\n\nThe schools may not look like what we picture in our minds. Actually, lessons often happen in mosques, courtyards, or during Friday prayers. However, their impact is rewriting the rules of family life in Senegal.\n\nAs Imam Diane puts it, the measure of a man is not how loudly he commands, but how tenderly he cares. And that lesson could be the difference between life and death.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In Senegal, many men make important family decisions, including whether women can get medical care during pregnancy. This affects the health of mothers and babies.\n\n**What happened** – A United Nations-backed program started “schools for husbands” where male community leaders learn about positive masculinity. These schools teach men to help with childcare, household tasks, and support their wives during pregnancy. The program began in 2011 and now includes over 300 men in more than 20 schools.\n\n**Impact** – Men who attend these schools change their behavior and influence their communities. For example, some convince family members to use hospitals for childbirth instead of risky home births. Women report that their husbands now help with cooking and childcare. The program also addresses issues like girls’ education and early marriage. Maternal deaths in Senegal have decreased but remain high, so these changes are important for saving lives.\n\n**What’s next step** – The program will continue to expand and hold discussions in mosques and community spaces. It aims to reach more men and families, helping change attitudes about gender roles and health care.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Teaching men to share family care and support their wives during pregnancy is helping reduce dangers for mothers and babies in Senegal.\n",

Cela influence la santé des mères et des bébés.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Un programme soutenu par les Nations Unies a lancé des « écoles pour maris » où des leaders masculins apprennent la masculinité positive. Ces écoles enseignent aux hommes à aider pour les enfants, les tâches ménagères et à soutenir leur épouse pendant la grossesse. Le programme a commencé en 2011 et compte plus de 300 hommes dans plus de 20 écoles.\n\n**Impact** – Les hommes formés changent leur comportement et influencent leur communauté. Par exemple, certains encouragent les familles à accoucher à l’hôpital plutôt qu’à la maison, ce qui est plus sûr. Des femmes disent que leur mari aide désormais à cuisiner et à s’occuper des enfants. Le programme aborde aussi l’éducation des filles et le mariage précoce. Les décès maternels ont diminué, mais restent élevés, donc ces changements sont importants.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le programme va continuer à s’étendre et organiser des discussions dans les mosquées et les communautés. Il veut toucher plus d’hommes et de familles pour changer les idées sur les rôles et la santé.\n\n**Phrase clé** – Apprendre aux hommes à partager les soins familiaux et soutenir leur épouse pendant la grossesse aide à réduire les dangers pour les mères et les bébés au Sénégal.\n",

Here's How\n\nThe Law of the Sea typically refers to international law described in a 1982 United Nations Convention that governs what states can and can’t do in the ocean, and it serves as the basis for modern-day international law governing the ocean. The newly ratified “high seas treaty” creating a framework for ocean conservation builds upon the foundation set by the Law of the Sea. But like other U.N. treaties, only recognized states were able to sign onto that law, and not Indigenous peoples like Gíidaak’s. The U.N. system prioritizes the perspectives and voices of governments that are internationally recognized, which makes it difficult for Indigenous peoples who have lost their lands and political independence to ensure their concerns are considered.\n\nGíidaak thinks that vacuum leaves opportunity for Indigenous peoples to organize and create their own version of international law that governs the oceans. Inspired by the Māori law of the sea in Aotearoa New Zealand, Gíidaak envisions a more expansive document that spans geographies and nationalities that could help Indigenous peoples more effectively organize and advocate around critical ocean issues like climate change and deep-sea mining.\n\nGrist spoke with ‘Wáahlaal Gíidaak about what an Indigenous Law of the Sea might entail, why it’s important, and what is being done to create it. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ. How would you describe your own personal connection to the sea?\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\n\n\n\n\nA. In our historical retelling of our islands, it is where ravens found a clam shell and pulled humans out of the clam shell. This is our story from time immemorial that tells of when humans first came to these islands This imperative and this connection to these islands has been one that’s existed for a very long time, and our connections to the nonhuman beings that exist in the ocean are part of our DNA and part of the thing that keeps us going.\n\nAbout 20 or so years ago they found one of our ancestors in a cave in Prince of Wales island, and that ancestor was about 10,000 years old. They tested the DNA for our ancestor against the population of today and sure enough it matched. But the thing I found interesting was the DNA they found in the stomach of that ancestor was salmon. So for over 10,000 years we have had a connection with salmon that preexisted any laws that dictated how we harvested our salmon today. The salmon that existed back then were saber-toothed salmon.\n\nWe are starting to see the salmon disappear from our homelands and it is the last, largest wild salmon stock on the planet. Many of our communities have gone without being able to harvest salmon for at least five years now because the salmon populations have been so mistreated that our people cannot sustain our way of life and our relationship with salmon like we have always done.\n\nQ. How is climate change affecting that relationship that you and your people have with the ocean?\n\n\n\n\n\nA. The Arctic is warming at four times the rate that it should be. As our ice sheets melt in the Arctic and in the central Arctic Ocean, it’s creating a rise in the ocean that’s impacting the rest of the world.\n\nWe’re seeing our glaciers really receding at an exacerbated rate and we need those glaciers to continue to provide for everything in our ecosystem. The glacier melts every year are what provides for our rivers. We need them to be at a steady pace and not one that’s exacerbated as it is today.\n\nFolks have been talking about turtles coming into our waters, which is crazy to think about these species that are typically subtropically making their way to Alaska, which is the last place you’d assume a subtropical species would be. We’re also seeing the changes in our ocean and our seaweed, which is a main part of our diet.\n\nQ. Why are you interested in compiling an Indigenous Law of the Sea?\n\n\n\n\n\nA. My sisters in this work realized there is a space for Indigenous people at these big convenings where they’re making decisions about our homelands, and usually the space for Indigenous people is an afterthought. We get a seat at the table sometimes. It’s not a voting seat. It’s not a space where Indigenous voices are front and center. And so thinking through and realizing that our laws still carry through to today in how we operate on the ocean, how we operate in our waters — not only state and federal laws but an ancestral way of caring for the ocean that goes beyond those spaces. We were realizing that if the world uplifted those same principles and protocols for how they operate on our waters, we could get a little further down the road of caring for our ocean and our waters and caring for beyond-human beings in those spaces, if we were to uplift the truths and protocols of our people in all spaces.\n\nQ. How would the creation of an Indigenous Law of the Sea interact with existing international law?\n\n\n\n\n\nA. As we set out to create an Indigenous Law of the Sea, it’s not to say that we’re just going to replicate the U.N. Law of the Sea and then just put Indigenous names and faces and words in there, but to create our own Indigenous law. We’re not saying that this should replace the U.N.’s Law of the Sea. What we’re saying is that this can be an additive: to share with the world the protocols by which Indigenous peoples have always held a relationship with waters, what the protocols have taught us for thousands of years on how to treat these oceans and our relatives that exist in these oceans, how do we live in a balance and how have our ancestors taught us how to have this relationship with the ocean? What is our taboo that still exists today for how we go out on the water, and how our children and our children’s children will be taught to respect and have that care for the place that has always sustained our way of life?\n\nJust writing those down, getting those stories out to the world so that the world can have a better understanding of what that protocol would look like.\n\nWe’re just having that conversation in Alaska right now, but we’re also in conversation with our relatives in Aotearoa New Zealand, in Hawaiʻi, with our brothers and sisters in Canada. What does it look like if we were to collectively pull into one document some of our similar stories and protocols for how we treat the ocean, and then just shared that with the world? This is a better way of being than what has currently existed, a way and a relationship that predates any government coming into these spaces that is not our own. And what would the world look like if everybody started to operate the way that Indigenous people have, and the way Indigenous people have cared for these places?\n\nQ. Why is this important?\n\n\n\n\n\nA. There is an opportunity for Indigenous people to say, “These are our laws,” and putting those front and center because we’ve never done that before.\n\nWe see so many different countries, so many different leaders trying their best to push things forward. And the laws that they’re creating are important, and the laws they’re taking a stand on are important. But we’ve never flexed our sovereignty as Indigenous people and said, “These are our waters.” They were our waters long before a lot of these government folks decided to step into these places, and our laws have had a reciprocal relationship in this space for a long time.\n\nThe sovereignty we carry is inherent. We have an inherent sovereignty. We had a sophisticated form of governing for our people, taking care of our communities long before any of these other governments decided that they wanted to be here. And so thinking through what it looks like for us to continue to uphold those sovereignty as nations of people across the country, across the globe, what does it look like for us to start flexing that sovereignty and saying, “Whatever’s happening over there is fine, but these are our laws, and this is our negotiated table. You can come and you can be an observer at our table. This is our table to finally have a conversation with just Indigenous people collectively standing on our own ancestral DNA and imperative for what the future protection and caring of these places should look like.”\n\nQ. Where are these conversations happening?\n\n\n\n\n\nA. We’ve held one gathering so far in Alaska. We invited all of our tribes and all of our native entities and leadership throughout Alaska to come sit down with us for three days. We invited our family from Aotearoa, our Māori brothers and sisters, to help us be catalyzers. The Māori are way ahead of us, like they always are. And they’ve already developed their own Indigenous Law of the Sea. And some Hawaiian folks and then some folks from Greenland and other places came to help us be catalyzers in this space. As it grows beyond Alaska, I would love to see something a little more formalized. We sat down at the U.N. Ocean Conference in France as an impromptu, informal gathering of what we ended up calling the Indigenous Peoples Ocean Alliance. I’m not sure where it’s going to take us, but I want to see us continue to grow in creating our own table.\n\nQ. What should Indigenous peoples know about who can participate in this process?\n\n\n\n\n\nA. A lot of our people think that they don’t carry the knowledge that can go into something like an Indigenous Law of the Sea, because so much has been lost as a result of colonization. And what we’ve shared with them is that you’re upholding those practices, and you know whether you have been told these are our traditional stories or not. The way that our people go out on the ocean, the way that people go in our waters, and the way they’re operating and treating these waters is part of that Indigenous Law of the Sea. I think that a lot of our people think that they have to be an expert in our traditional languages, or an expert in our traditional oratory or our traditional stories in order to come to these spaces and to speak the truth that we’ve always known of how we care for these places. And that’s absolutely not the case. I just want our people to feel that this is an opportunity for so many to share, especially those who are out on our waters day in and day out, what their relationship is with the water, what they’ve always been taught, how the world should be treating our oceans as a result of the lessons that they have learned over time.\n\nOur DNA tells us it’s our responsibility to care for these places, with or without funding, with or without support. We are going to fight for the future of these places. This imperative will last for the next 15,000 years in our responsibility to care for these places. We’re always going to be here. We’re always going to be in our homelands and in our home waters. We’re not going anywhere.\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify a point ‘Wáahlaal Gíidaak made about Arctic melting.",

      "content": "“Youth participation is not just about bringing young people to meetings,” General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday.\n\n“It’s about truly integrating their lived experience and their expertise to shape policy outcomes.”\n\nPrioritising rights and aspirations\n\nMs. Baerbock was speaking at an event to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the World Programme of Action for Youth.\n\nThe framework covers 15 priority areas, including education, employment, hunger and poverty; health and the environment; globalisation, information and communication technologies; armed conflict and intergenerational issues.\n\nIt shows that action for young people cuts across every issue and that they are drivers of change.\n\n© UNDP Members of the Sustainable Ocean Alliance, a youth-led non-profit in Tanzania.\n\nLeading the way\n\nAt roughly 1.2 billion, today’s youth generation – people aged 15-24 – is arguably the largest in history.\n\nYouth are at the forefront on climate action, digital innovation, building local solutions, and championing human rights, said Guy Ryder, UN Under-Secretary-General for Policy, who spoke on behalf of the Secretary-General.\n\n“Yet too often, they are shut out of decisions, decisions that shape their lives and face barriers to education, to decent work, to health services, and political participation,” he said.\n\n“At the same time, violence, instability, and shrinking civic space silence youth voices and place obstacles in the way of their meaningful contributions.”\n\nPaying the price\n\nThe commemoration was held to mark progress since the landmark framework but also to address unfinished business.\n\nAs the head of the UN’s Youth Office stated, the international community “must confront the sobering reality that millions of young people continue to be left behind.”\n\nFelipe Paullier said they are the ones “paying the highest price” when it comes to the climate crisis, digital disruptions, and growing threats to peace.\n\n“The reality is that conflict-related deaths have soared to the highest level since the adoption of the World Programme of Action for Youth,” he said.\n\n“This mean millions of young lives lost, displaced, or forever affected. From Gaza to Ukraine, from Haiti to the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo), to Sudan and so many other places in crisis, young people are being robbed of their education, their safety, and their future.”\n\nVoices of a generation\n\nPrior to the event, more than 75,000 young people in 182 countries shared their challenges and hopes through a “foresight activity” coordinated by his office.\n\nTweet URL\n\nThe insights will help to guide action, but this generation’s impact is already being felt across the world.\n\n“Young people are not waiting for tomorrow to become leaders; they are today’s leaders,” said Ms. Baerbock, who recalled that the recent historic ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on States’ obligations to address climate change was sparked by a group of students in the Pacific.\n\n‘Partner with us’\n\nFor Amina Alidi, a youth advocate with the UN in Malawi, the event was “more than a commemoration” but “a call to action.”\n\n“Young people remain steadfast in our optimism and determination to build a better future,” she said.\n\n“What we ask of the United Nations and its Member States is simple but urgent: Listen to us. Invest in us, and most important of all, partner with us.”\n\nJames Casserly from Ireland, an advocate for young people with disabilities, advised global leaders on what youth participation really means.\n\n“It is where people who have the power listen to us and take action because actions speak louder than words,” he said.\n\n“It is more than a box-ticking exercise. It is when we get to make our own decisions, and not just have other people make decisions on our behalf. As we always say, nothing about us without us.”",

      "title": "Cambodian and Thai activists unite to end hostility and promote peace over border disputes",
      "summary": "\"We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity and harmony.\"",
      "content": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nBetween July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace.\n\nThailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples.\n\nHostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes.\n\n“We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity.\n\nOu Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia.\n\nThey faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited.\n\nIn addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry.\n\nSolinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.”\n\nThe campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news.\n\n“We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn.\n\nPhallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people.\n\nWhen hatred is louder than empathy\n\nIn Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them.\n\nOften, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic.\n\n“All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn.\n\nOn the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced.\n\nShe disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said:\n\nThey have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy.\n\nEven though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn.\n\nShe insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides.\n\nSolinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies.\n\nA call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy\n\n“We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war.\n\nIn the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries.\n\nShe suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations.\n\nSolinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony.\n\n“Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin.\n\nIn terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nShe noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land.\n\n“Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",
