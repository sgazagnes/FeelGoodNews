      "title": "New cosmic lens measurements deepen the Hubble tension mystery",
      "summary": "Scientists are testing a novel way to measure cosmic expansion using time delays in gravitationally lensed quasars. Their results match “local” measurements but clash with early-universe estimates, strengthening the mysterious Hubble tension. This mismatch could point to new physics rather than observational error. Researchers now aim to boost precision to solve the puzzle.",
      "content": "Cosmologists are grappling with a major unresolved puzzle: they do not all agree on how fast the universe is expanding, and solving this puzzle could point to new physics. To check for hidden errors in traditional measurements that rely on markers such as supernovae, astronomers continually look for fresh ways to track cosmic expansion. In recent work, researchers including scientists at the University of Tokyo measured the universe's growth using new techniques and data from some of the most advanced telescopes available. Their approach takes advantage of the fact that light from extremely distant objects can travel to us along several different paths. Comparing these different routes helps refine models of what is happening on the very largest scales in the universe, including how space itself is stretching.\n\nHow fast is the universe expanding?\n\nWe know that the universe is enormous, and it is steadily growing larger. Its exact size is unknown, but its rate of expansion can be measured. This turns out to be more complicated than it sounds, because the expansion appears faster when we look at more distant regions of space. For every 3.3 million light years (or one megaparsec) of distance from Earth, objects at that distance appear to be moving away from us at about 73 kilometers per second. Put another way, the universe expands at 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc), a value known as the Hubble constant.\n\nDistance ladders and a new way to measure the Hubble constant\n\nScientists have developed several methods to estimate the Hubble constant, but until now they have all relied on so-called distance ladders. These ladders are built from objects such as supernovae and special stars called Cepheid variable stars. Because these objects are considered well understood, astronomers assume that even when they are observed in other galaxies, they can be used to estimate distances with high precision. Over decades of observations of many such objects, the allowed range for the Hubble constant has become narrower. However, some uncertainty has always remained about how reliable this approach is, so cosmologists are eager to test alternatives.\n\nIn their latest study, a team of astronomers that includes Project Assistant Professor Kenneth Wong and postdoctoral researcher Eric Paic from the University of Tokyo's Research Center for the Early Universe has successfully demonstrated a technique called time-delay cosmography. They argue that this method can reduce the field's dependence on distance ladders and could also have valuable applications in other branches of cosmology.\n\nUsing gravitational lensing as a cosmic measurement tool\n\n\"To measure the Hubble constant using time-delay cosmography, you need a really massive galaxy that can act as a lens,\" said Wong. \"The gravity of this 'lens' deflects light from objects hiding behind it around itself, so we see a distorted version of them. This is called gravitational lensing. If the circumstances are right, we'll actually see multiple distorted images, and each will have taken a slightly different pathway to get to us, taking different amounts of time. By looking for identical changes in these images that are slightly out of step, we can measure the difference in time they took to reach us. Coupling this data with estimates on the distribution of the mass of the galactic lens that's distorting them is what allows us to calculate the acceleration of distant objects more accurately. The Hubble constant we measure is well within the ranges supported by other modes of estimation.\"\n\nThe Hubble tension: conflicting views of the expanding universe\n\nIt may seem puzzling that researchers invest so much effort to refine a number that has already been measured many times. The reason is that this value sits at the heart of how scientists reconstruct the history and evolution of the universe, and there is a serious unresolved discrepancy. The value of 73 km/s/Mpc for the Hubble constant agrees with observations of relatively nearby objects. However, there are other ways to infer the cosmic expansion rate that look much farther back in time. One key method uses the radiation that fills the universe and traces back to the big bang, known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). When scientists analyze the CMB to estimate the Hubble constant, they obtain a lower value of 67 km/s/Mpc.\n\nThis mismatch between 73 km/s/Mpc and 67 km/s/Mpc is called the Hubble tension. The work by Wong, Paic and their colleagues helps illuminate what might be causing this tension, at a time when it is still unclear whether the discrepancy is simply due to experimental uncertainties or points to something deeper.\n\nIs the Hubble tension pointing to new physics?\n\n\"Our measurement of the Hubble constant is more consistent with other current-day observations and less consistent with early-universe measurements. This is evidence that the Hubble tension may indeed arise from real physics and not just some unknown source of error in the various methods,\" said Wong. \"Our measurement is completely independent of other methods, both early- and late-universe, so if there are any systematic uncertainties in those methods, we should not be affected by them.\"\n\n\"The main focus of this work was to improve our methodology, and now we need to increase the sample size to improve the precision and decisively settle the Hubble tension,\" said Paic. \"Right now, our precision is about 4.5%, and in order to really nail down the Hubble constant to a level that would definitively confirm the Hubble tension, we need to get to a precision of around 1-2%.\"\n\nMore lenses, more quasars, and higher precision\n\nThe researchers are optimistic that they can reach this higher level of accuracy. In the current study, they analyzed eight time-delay lens systems. Each system contains a foreground galaxy that acts as a lens and blocks our direct view of a distant quasar (a supermassive black hole that is accreting gas and dust, causing it to shine brightly). They also incorporated new observations from cutting-edge space-based and ground-based observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope. Looking ahead, the team plans to expand the number of lens systems they study, refine their measurements, and carefully identify or eliminate any remaining systematic sources of error.\n\nMass distribution uncertainties and a global cosmology effort\n\n\"One of the largest sources of uncertainty is the fact that we don't know exactly how the mass in the lens galaxies is distributed. It is usually assumed that the mass follows some simple profile that is consistent with observations, but it is hard to be sure, and this uncertainty can directly influence the values we calculate,\" said Wong. \"The Hubble tension matters, as it may point to a new era in cosmology revealing new physics. Our project is the result of a decades-long collaboration between multiple independent observatories and researchers, highlighting the importance of international collaboration in science.\"\n\nFunding: This work was supported by NASA (grants 80NSSC22K1294 and HST-AR-16149), the Max Planck Society (Max Planck Fellowship), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Germany's Excellence Strategy (EXC-2094, 390783311), the U.S. National Science Foundation (grants NSF-AST-1906976, NSF-AST-1836016, NSF-AST-2407277), the Moore Foundation (grant 8548), and JSPS KAKENHI (grant numbers JP20K14511, JP24K07089, JP24H00221).",

Some of it’s going to go out toward other things — payloads, science experiments, eventually rovers and other assets. Understanding those physics is pivotal to ensuring crew safety and mission success.”\n\nThe campaign, which will run through spring of 2026, should provide an absolute treasure trove of data that researchers will be able to use to improve predictive models and influence the design of space hardware. As Korzun mentioned, it’s a big undertaking, and it involves multiple NASA centers, academic institutions, and commercial entities both small and large.\n\nKorzun’ s team will test two types of propulsion systems in the vacuum sphere. For the first round of tests this fall, they are using an ethane plume simulation system designed by NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and built and operated by Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. The ethane system generates a maximum of about 100 pounds of thrust — imagine the force necessary to lift or support a 100-pound person. It heats up but doesn’t burn.\n\nA view of the ethane nozzle researchers are using during the first phase of testing.\n\nNASA/Wesley Chambers\n\nAfter completing the ethane tests, the second round of tests will involve a 14-inch, 3D-printed hybrid rocket motor developed at Utah State University in Logan, Utah, and recently tested at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. It produces around 35 pounds of thrust, igniting both solid propellant and a stream of gaseous oxygen to create a hot, powerful stream of rocket exhaust, simulating a real rocket engine but at smaller scale for this test series.\n\nResearchers will test both propulsion systems at various heights, firing them into a roughly six-and-a-half-foot diameter, one-foot-deep bin of simulated lunar regolith, called Black Point-1 that has jagged, cohesive properties similar to lunar regolith.\n\n“It gives us a huge range of test conditions,” Korzun said, “to be able to talk about spacecraft of all different kinds going to the Moon, and for us to understand what they’re going to do as they land or try to take back off from the surface.”\n\nResearchers will use this 14-inch, 3D-printed hybrid rocket motor during the second phase of testing.\n\nThe data from these tests at NASA Langley will be critical in developing and validating models to predict the effects of plume surface interaction for landing on the Moon and even Mars, ensuring mission success for the HLS landers and the safety of our astronauts Daniel Stubbs Engineer with HLS Plume and Aero Environments Team at NASA Marshall\n\nA number of different instruments, including a version of the specialized camera system that imaged the plume-surface interaction during the Blue Ghost landing, will capture data and imagery from the tests, which will only last about six seconds each. The instruments will measure crater formation, the speed and angle of ejecta particles, and the shapes of the engine plumes.\n\nKorzun sees this test campaign as more than a one-shot, Moon-specific thing. The entire operation is modular by design and can also prepare NASA for missions to Mars. The lunar regolith simulant can be replaced with a Mars simulant that’s more like sand. Pieces of hardware and instrumentation can be unbolted and replaced to represent future Mars landers. Rather than take the vacuum sphere down to really low pressure like on the Moon, it can be adjusted to a pressure that simulates the atmosphere on the Red Planet. “Mars has always been in our road maps,” Korzun said.\n\nBut for now, the Moon looms large.\n\nA number of instruments, including SCALPSS cameras similar to the ones that captured imagery of the plume-surface interaction between Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander and the Moon in March, will capture data on the sphere tests. NASA/Ryan Hill\n\n“This test campaign is one of the most flight-relevant and highly instrumented plume-surface interaction test series NASA has ever conducted,” said Daniel Stubbs, an engineer with the human landing systems plume and aero environments team at NASA Marshall. “The data from these tests at NASA Langley will be critical in developing and validating models to predict the effects of plume-surface interaction for landing on the Moon and even Mars, ensuring mission success for the human landing systems and the safety of our astronauts.”\n\nThrough the Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build upon our foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars – for the benefit of all.\n\nFor more information about Artemis, visit:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/artemis\n\nThe testing platform is engineered to accommodate the engine nozzles, simulated lunar soil and instrumentation.\n\nNASA/Wesley Chambers\n\nJoe Atkinson\n\nNASA Langley Research Center",

      "title": "Astronomers capture sudden black hole blast firing ultra fast winds",
      "summary": "A sudden X-ray flare from a supermassive black hole in galaxy NGC 3783 triggered ultra-fast winds racing outward at a fifth the speed of light—an event never witnessed before. Using XMM-Newton and XRISM, astronomers caught the blast unfold in real time, revealing how tangled magnetic fields can rapidly “untwist” and hurl matter into space much like an enormous, cosmic-scale version of the Sun’s coronal mass ejections.",
      "content": "Leading X-ray observatories XMM-Newton and XRISM have captured a remarkable and previously unrecorded eruption from a supermassive black hole. Over the course of only a few hours, the intense gravity of this object stirred up extremely fast winds that pushed material outward at an astonishing 60,000 km per second.\n\nThis enormous black hole sits in NGC 3783, a striking spiral galaxy recently photographed by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Astronomers observed a bright X-ray flare burst from the black hole and fade almost immediately. As the flare diminished, high-velocity winds appeared, racing outward at roughly one-fifth the speed of light.\n\n\"We've not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before,\" says lead researcher Liyi Gu at Space Research Organization Netherlands (SRON). \"For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day.\"\n\nInside an Active Galactic Nucleus\n\nTo investigate NGC 3783 and its central black hole, Gu and his team used the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton together with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), a JAXA-led mission with ESA and NASA participation.\n\nThe black hole, containing the mass of about 30 million Suns, consumes nearby gas and dust. This activity powers a brilliantly luminous and energetic zone at the galaxy's center called an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). AGNs emit light across the electromagnetic spectrum and can drive strong jets and winds into their surroundings.\n\n\"AGNs are really fascinating and intense regions, and key targets for both XMM-Newton and XRISM,\" notes Matteo Guainazzi, ESA XRISM Project Scientist and co-author of the discovery.\n\n\"The winds around this black hole seem to have been created as the AGN's tangled magnetic field suddenly 'untwisted' -- similar to the flares that erupt from the Sun, but on a scale almost too big to imagine.\"\n\nBlack Hole Winds That Echo Solar Eruptions\n\nThe newly detected winds resemble the Sun's coronal mass ejections, powerful outbursts that launch huge clouds of charged material into space. This comparison suggests that, in some moments, a supermassive black hole can behave in ways similar to our own star, making these distant giants feel slightly more familiar.\n\nA real-world example occurred on November 11, when the Sun produced a coronal mass ejection following an intense flare. The material expelled during that solar event shot out at initial speeds of 1500 km per second.\n\n\"Windy AGNs also play a big role in how their host galaxies evolve over time, and how they form new stars,\" says Camille Diez, a team member and ESA Research Fellow.\n\n\"Because they're so influential, knowing more about the magnetism of AGNs, and how they whip up winds such as these, is key to understanding the history of galaxies throughout the Universe.\"\n\nTwo Telescopes Working in Unison\n\nXMM-Newton has spent more than 25 years exploring the hottest and most extreme environments in space, while XRISM has been studying how matter and energy move through the Universe since its launch in September 2023.\n\nTogether, these missions uncovered this extraordinary episode and helped scientists understand the flare and the resulting winds. XMM-Newton followed the evolution of the flare with its Optical Monitor and measured the reach of the winds using the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC). XRISM detected the flare and winds with its Resolve instrument, which analyzed their velocity, structure, and the processes that launched them.\n\n\"Their discovery stems from successful collaboration, something that's a core part of all ESA missions,\" explains ESA XMM-Newton Project Scientist Erik Kuulkers.\n\n\"By zeroing in on an active supermassive black hole, the two telescopes have found something we've not seen before: rapid, ultra-fast, flare-triggered winds reminiscent of those that form at the Sun. Excitingly, this suggests that solar and high-energy physics may work in surprisingly familiar ways throughout the Universe.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Supermassive black holes sit at the centers of many galaxies and can pull in gas and dust. This activity creates very bright regions called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), which can release energy and matter into space in winds and jets.\n\n**What happened** – Astronomers using two space telescopes, XMM-Newton and XRISM, watched a sudden X-ray flare from a black hole in galaxy NGC 3783. This flare quickly triggered winds moving outward at about 60,000 kilometers per second, or one-fifth the speed of light. The event happened over just a few hours and was caught in real time.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time scientists have seen such fast winds form immediately after a black hole flare. The winds are thought to come from magnetic fields near the black hole suddenly untwisting, similar to solar flares on the Sun but on a much larger scale. Understanding these winds helps explain how black holes affect their galaxies, including how stars form and how galaxies grow.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will continue studying black holes and their magnetic fields using these telescopes to learn more about how such winds form and influence galaxies. This discovery may also help connect solar physics with phenomena around black holes in space.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – For the first time, astronomers have seen a black hole flare trigger ultra-fast winds, revealing new details about how black holes interact with their galaxies.",
