      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nFor decades, climate action skeptics have waved a tired argument: you can’t grow the economy and cut carbon emissions at the same time. But a new report suggests that narrative may be heading for retirement. In fact, a global shift is well underway, and it’s flipping that assumption on its head.\n\nAccording to fresh data from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), more countries than ever are growing their economies while shrinking their carbon footprints. And no, it’s not just a fluke or a one-off COVID blip. It’s a real, sustained trend.\n\nDrawing on the 2025 Global Carbon Budget and a newly refined classification system, the report examined 113 countries covering more than 97 percent of global GDP and 93 percent of emissions. Based on this, researchers are concluding that decoupling is now the “norm, not the exception.”\n\n“We’re sometimes told that the world can’t cut emissions without cutting growth,” said John Lang, one of the report’s authors and Net Zero Tracker Lead at ECIU. “The opposite is happening.”\n\nWhat exactly is decoupling?\n\nLet’s break it down. Decoupling refers to breaking the historic link between economic growth and rising emissions. It comes in two main flavors:\n\nAbsolute decoupling: emissions go down while GDP goes up. This is the gold standard.\n\nemissions go down while GDP goes up. This is the gold standard. Relative decoupling: emissions still rise, but slower than GDP.\n\nThere’s also recoupling, which is the less ideal scenario where emissions and GDP both rise, or worse, emissions rise while GDP falls. Thankfully, that’s getting rarer and usually pops up during major economic shocks (such as the pandemic years).\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has historically called global-scale absolute decoupling “controversial.” But this new analysis suggests that it’s not just possible, it’s already happening, and at a growing pace.\n\nWho’s walking the decoupling talk?\n\nBetween 2015 and 2023, nearly half of the global economy (46 percent of GDP) achieved absolute decoupling. That’s a whopping 38 percent increase compared to the decade before the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn total, 92 percent of the global economy and 89 percent of global emissions are now found in countries that have either relatively or absolutely decoupled.\n\nThe ECIU sorted countries into three categories:\n\nConsistent decouplers: Nations that achieved absolute decoupling both before and after the Paris Agreement.\n\nNations that achieved absolute decoupling both before and after the Paris Agreement. Improvers: Countries that didn’t manage it before 2015, but did between 2015 and 2023.\n\nCountries that didn’t manage it before 2015, but did between 2015 and 2023. Reversals: Places that had previously decoupled but have since backslid.\n\nEurope leads the decoupling charge\n\nUnsurprisingly, Europe is doing much of the heavy lifting. The list of consistent decouplers includes a solid lineup: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK, among others.\n\nNotably, this report used consumption-based emissions data, meaning it accounted for carbon footprints of imported goods, not just what’s emitted domestically. That sidesteps the common criticism that wealthy countries just “offshore” their emissions by outsourcing production.\n\nSome countries made solid progress post-2015, like Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and Greece, earning them the title of “improvers.” Meanwhile, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia slipped into the “reversal” camp.\n\nAnd yes, some of the biggest emissions drops in proportional terms happened in Western Europe, including Norway, Switzerland, and the UK.\n\nNet zero is more than a climate goal—it’s an economic strategy\n\nThe decoupling trend isn’t just good climate news but a powerful economic signal. According to Gareth Redmond-King of ECIU, the clean energy sector is already outpacing the fossil fuel industry in global employment, while net zero industries are growing three times faster than the economy overall.\n\n“The momentum built by the Paris Agreement is unstoppable,” Redmond-King said, adding that net zero remains the “only solution to halting ever more costly and dangerous impacts.”\n\nEven with global emissions still rising, albeit more slowly, the report’s authors argue that the underlying structural change is unmistakable. And with more countries joining the decoupling club, the once “controversial” idea of green growth is now grounded in evidence.\n\nA climate myth bites the dust\n\nThe old assumption that climate action must come at the expense of economic growth is looking increasingly outdated. While challenges remain and not every country is hitting absolute decoupling just yet, the overall trajectory is clear.\n\nMore economies are proving that it’s entirely possible to scale up prosperity while scaling down emissions. And that might be one of the most hopeful climate shifts we’ve seen in a long time.\n\nThis solution is highlighted by The World Business Academy, the umbrella organization housing The Optimist Daily.

      "content": "Tree bark has a total surface area similar to all of the land area on Earth. It is home to a wide range of microbial species unknown to science, and they can either take up or emit gases that have a warming effect on the climate\n\nMelaleuca wetland forests in New South Wales, Australia, are hotspots for tree microbial life Luke Jeffrey / Southern Cross University\n\nThe bark of a single tree can be home to trillions of bacteria, and these microbes may have an important but neglected role in controlling greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe total surface area of tree bark on the planet is thought to be around 143 million square kilometres, nearly as much as the world’s total land surface area. This surface makes up an immense microbial habitat known as the caulosphere, but the microbes that live there have received little attention from scientists.\n\n“In a way it’s so obvious, but we have always overlooked tree bark,” says Bob Leung at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “We never thought of microbes on tree bark, but it makes sense, because bacteria are everywhere, and if we can find microbes in soils, on tree leaves, then most likely there will be microbes on bark.”\n\nLeung and his colleagues began by studying a wetland species commonly known as paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). They found that there were more than 6 trillion bacteria living in or on each square metre of bark, comparable to the volumes found in soil.\n\nGenetic analysis of 114 of these bacteria showed that they mostly came from three bacterial families – Acidobacteriaceae, Mycobacteriaceae and Acetobacteraceae – but all of the species were completely unknown to science.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nRemarkably, these microbes have one thing in common: they can use hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane as fuel to survive. Hydrogen (H 2 ) isn’t itself a greenhouse gas, but through reactions with other molecules it can increase the warming effect of methane in the atmosphere.\n\nThe researchers then looked at the bark of another seven Australian tree species from a range of habitats, including casuarinas, gum trees and banksias, measuring, both in the field and in lab conditions, whether the bark of the different species absorbed or emitted greenhouse gases.\n\nThey found that all barks consumed hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane in aerobic conditions when oxygen is available. But when trees are submerged in water and oxygen is limited, such as in swamps, bark microbes switched to producing the same gases.\n\nThe canopy of Melaleuca quinquenervia trees in an Australian forest Luke Jeffrey / Southern Cross University\n\nThe team estimates that the total amount of hydrogen absorbed by bark microbes globally is between 0.6 and 1.6 billion kilograms each year, representing as much as 2 per cent of the total atmospheric hydrogen removed.\n\nThis is the first time scientists have attempted to assess the contribution of tree bark to atmospheric hydrogen, says team member Luke Jeffrey at Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia.\n\n“Discovering the hidden role of trees doing more than just capturing carbon dioxide in their wood is very important,” says Jeffrey. “They are active cyclers in other greenhouse gases. This is exciting, because H 2 affects the lifetime of methane in our atmosphere, therefore H 2 consumption in bark may help in reducing our growing methane problem.”\n\nHowever, the global picture is highly uncertain, as the team has only sampled eight tree species from eastern Australia. “A lot of work now needs to be done across various forest types, tree species, microbial communities and site conditions,” says Jeffrey.\n\nBrett Summerell at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney says the study highlights how little we know about the composition, diversity, abundance and role of microorganisms in bark. “How this might vary across a broader range of tree species, particularly in drier climates such as savannahs and woodlands, is interesting,” says Summerell.\n\nIt will also be important to understand the interactions between fungi and bacteria in bark, he adds.",

Tree bark covers a huge area on Earth, similar to all the land combined, and it turns out it is home to many microbes that affect gases in the air.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers in Australia studied bacteria living on the bark of paperbark trees and found trillions of microbes in just one square meter. These microbes use gases like hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane to survive. In places where trees are dry, the bark microbes take in these gases, but in swampy, wet areas, they can release them instead. This discovery shows that bark microbes can both reduce and add greenhouse gases depending on conditions.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time scientists have measured how much hydrogen gas bark microbes absorb worldwide. Their work suggests these tiny organisms remove up to 2% of the hydrogen in the atmosphere each year. Since hydrogen affects methane—a powerful greenhouse gas—this process on tree bark could influence climate change more than we thought. It reveals a new natural way trees help manage greenhouse gases beyond just absorbing carbon dioxide.\n\n**What's next step** – The research team plans to study more tree species and different environments to better understand how bark microbes behave around the world.

      "title": "Recycling Mystery: Black-Colored Plastic",
      "summary": "Black plastic gets its color from carbon black pigment and is commonly used in food...\nThe post Recycling Mystery: Black-Colored Plastic appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "Black plastic gets its color from carbon black pigment and is commonly used in food containers, such as meat or produce trays and take-out containers, as well as disposable coffee lids, plastic bags, and hard plastic items like DVD cases and planters. While plastic is one of the categories of things that we are encouraged to recycle — when we can’t reuse or repurpose it — not all black plastic items can be recycled.\n\nBefore we get into the details of recycling black plastic, here are some general recycling reminders:\n\nAlways follow local recycling rules. Recycling programs vary by location.\n\nIf you have questions about local recycling rules, ask your waste management provider, your town, or the place where you drop off your recycling.\n\nIf you’re unsure whether something can be recycled, leave it out of the recycling bin. Adding items your local program doesn’t accept can cause problems and make recycling more expensive.\n\nWhat Makes Black-Colored Plastic Different?\n\nClear, white, and light-colored plastics are most valuable to recyclers because they can be turned into many different colors. Black plastic can only be recycled into other black items, which lowers the value of a batch.\n\nSome black plastic is made from electronic waste, which can contain toxic materials. This is a problem if the recycled plastic is used for food containers. A 2024 study in Chemosphere by Toxic-Free Future found flame retardants, including the banned chemical deca-BDE, in 85% of tested black plastic household items like kitchen utensils, sushi trays, and toys. These chemicals are linked to cancer, hormone problems, and developmental harm in children exposed through their mothers.\n\nOptical sorting machines can’t detect black items, so black plastic has to be sorted by hand, which adds work and cost for recyclers. The carbon black pigment absorbs near-infrared light, making these plastics invisible to most automated sorting systems.\n\nCan You Put It In Your Curbside Bin?\n\nDON’T put black plastics in your curbside recycling bin unless your local program says they are accepted. If you can’t reuse or repurpose them, throw them in the trash.\n\nDO avoid buying products packaged in black plastic.\n\nDON’T reuse black plastic containers for food storage, since they might be contaminated with toxic chemicals from e-waste recycling.\n\nWhat About Black Plastic Bags and Film Wrap?\n\nYou can include black plastic bags, plastic film, and plastic wrap in the plastic-bag recycling at participating supermarkets and other drop-off locations. Since plastic bags and film can jam sorting machines, they are usually sorted by hand, so the color doesn’t matter. This is also why you shouldn’t put bags in your curbside bin.\n\nHowever, only drop off black plastic bags if they meet all recycling requirements: they should be stretchy, clean, and dry.\n\nDeposit Plastic Beverage Containers\n\nTo date, there do not seem to be any black-colored plastic deposit containers (water, soda, etc.), but in case you run into some:\n\nLiz Philpott, public relations and BottleDrop Give program coordinator for Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, said, “All our machines and equipment can handle black plastic containers, although there aren’t many for beverages. What we probably see most of is black plastic bottle caps — which, on the plastic bottles, we can take.”\n\nIf you use deposit-bottle reverse vending machines to return plastic bottles, the machines will accept some and reject others, depending on what they are set up to take.\n\nMail-In Recycling Options\n\nThere are very few mail-in programs just for black plastic food containers. TerraCycle ended its Rubbermaid black plastic container recycling program in December 2023 because processing these materials is difficult. TerraCycle does offer Zero Waste Boxes for hard-to-recycle items, but these paid programs usually cost $250 to $580 per box and don’t focus on black plastic food containers.\n\nSome regional pickup services like Ridwell accept hard-to-recycle plastics, including some black items, but coverage is limited to specific metro areas based on local processing capabilities. Before signing up for any program, confirm they accept black plastic containers specifically; many exclude them due to the same sorting and contamination issues that affect municipal recycling.\n\nWhat About “Advanced” or “Chemical” Recycling?\n\nChemical recycling companies have expressed interest in black plastics as feedstock since their pyrolysis processes break materials down at the molecular level, where color doesn’t matter. According to Recycling Magazine, chemical recyclers “are looking for polyethylene, and they don’t care if it has black because they break it down into a gas and convert it into oil, which is transformed into virgin plastic.”\n\nHowever, these technologies remain largely unproven at scale, and consumers currently have no direct access to them. A Bain & Company analysis found that pyrolysis costs more than twice those of virgin plastic production, with 20-30 years needed to achieve cost parity. A separate report by Zero Waste Europe suggested pyrolysis may take 50 years to become commercially viable.\n\nSome chemical recyclers are finding ways to use byproducts. In October 2025, Plastic Energy started selling TACFILLER, a char byproduct from their recycling process that can replace carbon black in making rubber, with about 89% lower emissions. While this is promising for industry, it doesn’t give consumers a way to recycle black plastics. Instead, it uses mixed plastic waste, including black plastics, as material for chemical processing.\n\nDon’t count on chemical recycling to solve the black plastic problem anytime soon. It’s not available to consumers, economic viability remains questionable, and concerns persist about emissions and energy intensity compared to mechanical recycling.\n\nEmerging Alternatives: NIR-Detectable Pigments\n\nThe most promising development for black plastic recycling isn’t a new recycling technology; it’s replacing carbon black pigment with alternatives that can be detected by sorting equipment.\n\nSeveral companies have created NIR-reflective black pigments that keep the black look people and brands want, but also let automated sorting machines detect them. Companies like Ampacet, Cabot Corporation, and LyondellBasell have introduced black masterbatches that reflect NIR light, so recycling facilities can sort these materials properly.\n\nIn December 2025, UPM launched Circular Renewable Black, the first bio-based, carbon-negative black pigment made from lignin that can also be detected by NIR sorting equipment.\n\nThese new pigments aren’t widely used yet, but some big brands are making changes. Sam’s Club switched its rotisserie chicken containers from black to a lighter stone color to make them easier to recycle. Walgreens and SC Johnson have also changed the cap colors on some products. Reformulating packaging like this may be the most practical way to cut down on black plastic waste.\n\nPhotothermal Recycling\n\nResearchers at Cornell and Princeton published a study in ACS Central Science in late 2024 showing a new approach: using the carbon black pigment itself to recycle black polystyrene.\n\nThis method uses visible light from LEDs or focused sunlight to start a process called photothermal conversion. The carbon black absorbs the light and creates intense heat, which breaks polystyrene down into styrene monomer. With focused sunlight, researchers converted up to 80% of the material to styrene in just five minutes. Both the carbon black and styrene can be recovered and reused.\n\nPhotothermal recycling is still just a lab experiment, not something consumers can use yet. But it shows that the same light-absorbing properties that make black plastic hard to sort might one day help with chemical recycling.\n\nGeneral Advice and Looking Ahead\n\nThe best thing you can do is avoid black plastics whenever you can. Tell businesses you’d rather have packaging you can recycle locally. Try to shop at places that don’t use black plastic, and instead:\n\nUse non-black plastic, like white coffee lids.\n\nUse compostable or biodegradable plastics for food trays and similar items. Keep in mind, though, that these usually need the high heat of commercial composting facilities and won’t break down in your backyard compost pile. If you have curbside compost pickup, check that your program accepts these items before putting them in your compost bin. Not all commercial composting facilities can handle them.\n\nChoose and support reusable options, like mugs and bags.\n\nGiven the documented toxicity concerns from e-waste contamination, replacing black plastic kitchen utensils and food containers with stainless steel, glass, or wood alternatives is a worthwhile investment for your health and the environment.\n\nThe recycling industry is getting better at detecting black plastic. Sensor technology has improved a lot in the last five years, but there’s still not much demand for recycled black plastic. As Jeff Snyder, senior vice president of recycling and sustainability at Rumpke Waste & Recycling, told Packaging Dive in 2024: “I believe I can sort it… But I also believe that the end markets don’t want it.”\n\nUntil there’s more demand and fewer contamination issues, the best solution is to stop using black plastic in single-use packaging. Look for other options when you shop and let companies know you’ll only consider their products if they don’t use this hard-to-recycle material.\n\nEditor’s Note: This article was originally published on January 7, 2021 and most recently updated in January 2026.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nBlack plastic is used in many everyday items like food containers, coffee lids, and plastic bags. It gets its color from carbon black pigment, which makes it hard for recycling machines to detect and sort. Because of this, black plastic often cannot be recycled like other plastics.\n\n**What happened**\nResearchers and companies are working on new ways to recycle black plastic. Some are creating black pigments that machines can detect using near-infrared (NIR) light, making sorting easier. Scientists also found a method called photothermal recycling that uses light to break down black plastic into reusable parts. Meanwhile, some stores are switching to lighter-colored packaging to improve recycling.\n\n**Impact**\nThese developments are important because black plastic is common but difficult to recycle, causing more waste and pollution. New pigments and recycling methods could help reduce black plastic in landfills by making recycling more efficient. Changing packaging colors also helps consumers recycle more successfully.\n\n**What's next step**\nMore companies are expected to adopt NIR-detectable black pigments, and researchers will continue developing photothermal recycling techniques. Consumers can help by avoiding black plastic products and choosing reusable or compostable options. Recycling programs may improve as demand for black plastic recycling grows.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nInnovations in pigments and recycling methods are making it easier to recycle black plastic, a common but challenging material, while consumers and companies take steps to reduce its use.\n\n",

      "summary": "According to the minister, investments in the transmission and distribution system are crucial for the resilience and security of the state.",
      "content": "Prague – Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlíček (ANO) wants to make greater use of money from European funds for investments in the development and strengthening of domestic energy networks, especially from the Modernisation Fund and the EU defence programme SAFE. According to him, this would allow the Czech Republic to draw tens to hundreds of billions of crowns. He wants to limit the impact of investments on the level of the regulated component of energy prices. Havlíček said this in an interview with ČTK.\n\nThe final energy prices paid by customers consist of a commercial and a regulated component. The commercial part is set by suppliers, while the regulated part is set by the state through the Energy Regulatory Office (ERÚ). The regulated part of energy prices mainly includes the fee for transmission and distribution.\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Andreje Babiše (ANO) decided in December that the state will take over all financing of supported energy sources (POZE) next year, including renewable and secondary energy sources. The state budget for 2026 will newly be burdened with another roughly CZK 17 billion, so overall the state will pay more than CZK 41 billion in fees. Until now, the financing of POZE has been divided between the state and consumers. The aim of the change was to reduce regulated electricity prices, which for this year have thus fallen year-on-year by 15 percent for households.\n\n“We will of course continue,” said Havlíček. According to him, shifting POZE fees entirely to the state was the fastest possible measure to reduce energy prices. Further steps will, in his view, require more time. The minister wants to focus on other fees that are linked to the regulated energy price. In the coming years, the growing need for investments in the development and maintenance of energy networks should be increasingly reflected in it. “There are more solutions, but they are not short-term,” he said.\n\nHavlíček therefore wants to make greater use of European programmes for investments. He wants to draw money mainly from the Modernisation Fund and the Safe programme, which the EU has earmarked to strengthen investments in European defence capabilities. According to the minister, investments in the transmission and distribution system are crucial for the resilience and security of the state. According to Havlíček, money from European funds is intended to limit the impact of large investments on the regulated part of energy prices. Without further steps, they would increase significantly in the coming years, the minister said. He rejected the idea that the government is planning to reduce VAT on energy. “In the long term this is not a solution, and moreover it will not help companies,” Havlíček said. (8 January)",
