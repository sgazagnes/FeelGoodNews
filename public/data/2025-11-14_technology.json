      "title": "A radical upgrade pushes quantum links 200x farther",
      "summary": "Scientists have developed a new way to build rare-earth crystals that boosts quantum coherence to tens of milliseconds. This leap could extend quantum communication distances from city blocks to entire continents. The method uses atom-by-atom construction for unprecedented material purity.",
      "content": "Quantum computers can perform certain calculations at remarkable speeds, yet connecting them over long distances has been one of the major obstacles to building large, reliable quantum networks.\n\nUntil recently, two quantum computers could only link through a fiber cable over a span of a few kilometers. This limitation meant that a system on the University of Chicago's South Side campus could not communicate with one in the Willis Tower, even though both are located within the same city. The distance was simply too great for current technology.\n\nA new study published on November 6 in Nature Communications by University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (UChicago PME) Asst. Prof. Tian Zhong suggests that this boundary can be pushed dramatically farther. His team's work indicates that quantum connections could, in theory, extend up to 2,000 km (1,243 miles).\n\nWith this method, the UChicago quantum computer that once struggled to reach the Willis Tower could instead connect with a device located outside Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n\"For the first time, the technology for building a global-scale quantum internet is within reach,\" said Zhong, who recently received the prestigious Sturge Prize for this research.\n\nWhy Quantum Coherence Matters\n\nTo create high-performance quantum networks, researchers must entangle atoms and maintain that entanglement as signals travel through fiber cables. The greater the coherence time of those entangled atoms, the farther apart the connected quantum computers can be.\n\nIn the new study, Zhong's team succeeded in raising the coherence time of individual erbium atoms from 0.1 milliseconds to more than 10 milliseconds. In one experiment, they achieved 24 milliseconds of coherence. Under ideal conditions, this improvement could enable communication between quantum computers separated by roughly 4,000 km, the distance between UChicago PME and Ocaña, Colombia.\n\nBuilding the Same Materials in a New Way\n\nThe team did not switch to unfamiliar or exotic materials. Instead, they reimagined how the materials were constructed. They produced the rare-earth doped crystals required for quantum entanglement using a method called molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) rather than the standard Czochralski method.\n\n\"The traditional way of making this material is by essentially a melting pot,\" Zhong said, referring to the Czochralski approach. \"You throw in the right ratio of ingredients and then melt everything. It goes above 2,000 degrees Celsius and is slowly cooled down to form a material crystal.\"\n\nAfterward, researchers carve the cooled crystal chemically to shape it into a usable component. Zhong likens this to a sculptor chiseling away at marble until the final form emerges.\n\nMBE relies on a very different idea. It resembles 3D printing, but at the atomic scale. The process lays down the crystal in extremely thin layers, eventually forming the exact structure needed for the device.\n\n\"We start with nothing and then assemble this device atom by atom,\" Zhong said. \"The quality or purity of this material is so high that the quantum coherence properties of these atoms become superb.\"\n\nAlthough MBE has been used in other areas of materials science, it had not previously been applied to this type of rare-earth doped material. For this project, Zhong collaborated with materials synthesis specialist UChicago PME Asst. Prof. Shuolong Yang to adapt MBE to their needs.\n\nInstitute of Photonic Sciences Prof. Dr. Hugues de Riedmatten, who was not part of the study, described the results as an important step forward. \"The approach demonstrated in this paper is highly innovative,\" he said. \"It shows that a bottom-up, well-controlled nanofabrication approach can lead to the realization of single rare-earth ion qubits with excellent optical and spin coherence properties, leading to a long-lived spin photon interface with emission at telecom wavelength, all in a fiber-compatible device architecture. This is a significant advance that offers an interesting scalable avenue for the production of many networkable qubits in a controlled fashion.\"\n\nPreparing for Real-World Tests\n\nThe next phase of the project is to determine whether the improved coherence times can indeed support long-distance quantum communication outside of theoretical models.\n\n\"Before we actually deploy fiber from, let's say, Chicago to New York, we're going to test it just within my lab,\" Zhong said.\n\nThe team plans to link two qubits housed in separate dilution refrigerators (\"fridges\") inside Zhong's laboratory using 1,000 kilometers of coiled fiber. This step will help them verify that the system behaves as expected before moving to larger scales.\n\n\"We're now building the third fridge in my lab. When it's all together, that will form a local network, and we will first do experiments locally in my lab to simulate what a future long-distance network will look like,\" Zhong said. \"This is all part of the grand goal of creating a true quantum internet, and we're achieving one more milestone towards that.\"",

Until now, quantum links worked only across a few kilometers, limiting their use to small areas like parts of a city.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists at the University of Chicago developed a new way to build special crystals using a technique called molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). This method creates much purer materials by adding atoms one by one. As a result, the time that quantum information lasts inside these crystals increased from about 0.1 milliseconds to over 10 milliseconds, even reaching 24 milliseconds in some tests.

This innovation solves longstanding limitations in quasicrystal-based designs and could accelerate advances in photonic computing.",
      "content": "Researchers are exploring a new generation of computers that operate using light, or photons, instead of electrical currents. Systems that rely on light to store and process information could one day run far more efficiently and complete calculations much faster than conventional machines.\n\nLight-driven computing is still at an early stage, and one of the main technical obstacles involves controlling tiny streams of light traveling through a chip. Rerouting these microscopic signals without weakening them requires carefully engineered materials. To keep signals strong, the hardware must include a lightweight substance that prevents stray light from entering from any direction. This type of material is known as an \"isotropic bandgap material.\"\n\nDiscovery of Gyromorphs at NYU\n\nScientists at New York University have identified a new material called \"gyromorphs\" that meets this challenge more effectively than any other known structure. Gyromorphs combine features normally associated with liquids and crystals, yet they exceed both in their ability to block incoming light from all angles. The discovery, reported in Physical Review Letters, introduces a fresh strategy for tuning optical behavior and could help advance the development of photonic computers.\n\n\"Gyromorphs are unlike any known structure in that their unique makeup gives rise to better isotropic bandgap materials than is possible with current approaches,\" says Stefano Martiniani, an assistant professor of physics, chemistry, mathematics and neural science, and the senior author of the study.\n\nWhy Existing Materials Fall Short\n\nFor decades, researchers have looked to quasicrystals when designing isotropic bandgap materials. These structures, first proposed by physicists Paul Steinhardt and Dov Levine in the 1980s and later observed by Dan Schechtman, follow mathematical rules but do not repeat like traditional crystals.\n\nDespite their promise, quasicrystals come with a trade-off noted by the NYU team. They may completely block light, but only from limited directions. Alternatively, they can weaken light from all directions but fail to fully stop it. This limitation has driven scientists to search for alternatives that can block signal-degrading light more comprehensively.\n\nEngineering New Metamaterials\n\nIn their Physical Review Letters study, the NYU researchers created \"metamaterials,\" which are engineered structures whose properties depend on their architecture rather than on their chemical composition. One major challenge in designing these materials lies in understanding how their arrangement leads to desired physical behaviors.\n\nTo overcome this, the team developed an algorithm capable of producing functional structures with built-in disorder. Their work revealed a new form of \"correlated disorder\" that sits between the fully ordered and fully random extremes.\n\n\"Think of trees in a forest -- they grow at random positions, but not completely random because they're usually a certain distance from one another,\" Martiniani explains. \"This new pattern, gyromorphs, combines properties that we believed to be incompatible and displays a function that outperforms all ordered alternatives, including quasicrystals.\"\n\nHow Gyromorphs Achieve Their Unique Capabilities\n\nDuring their analysis, the scientists observed that every isotropic bandgap material exhibited a shared structural signature.\n\n\"We wanted to make this structural signature as pronounced as possible,\" says Mathias Casiulis, a postdoctoral fellow in NYU's Department of Physics and the paper's lead author. \"The result was a new class of materials -- gyromorphs -- that reconcile seemingly incompatible features.\n\n\"This is because gyromorphs don't have a fixed, repeating structure like a crystal, which gives them a liquid-like disorder, but, at the same time, if you look at them from a distance they form regular patterns. These properties work together to create bandgaps that lightwaves can't penetrate from any direction.\"\n\nThe research also included Aaron Shih, an NYU graduate student, and received support from the Simons Center for Computational Physical Chemistry (839534) and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA9550-25-1-0359).",

      "content": "A Tiny Reasoning Model beat Large Language Models in solving logic puzzles, despite being trained on a much smaller dataset. Credit: Getty\n\nA small-scale artificial-intelligence model that learns from only a limited pool of data is exciting researchers for its potential to boost reasoning abilities. The model, known as Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), outperformed some of the world’s best large language models (LLMs) at the Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI), a test involving visual logic puzzles that is designed to flummox most machines.\n\nThe model — detailed in a preprint on the arXiv server last month1 — is not readily comparable to an LLM. It is highly specialized, excelling only on the type of logic puzzles on which it is trained, such as sudokus and mazes, and it doesn’t ‘understand’ or generate language. But its ability to perform so well on so few resources — it is 10,000 times smaller than frontier LLMs — suggests a possible route for boosting this capability more widely in AI, say researchers.\n\n“It’s fascinating research into other forms of reasoning that one day might get used in LLMs,” says Cong Lu, a machine-learning researcher formerly at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. However, he cautions that the techniques might no longer be as effective if applied on a much larger scale. “Often techniques work very well at small model sizes and then just stop working,” at a bigger scale, he says.\n\nA test of artificial intelligence\n\n“The results are very significant in my opinion,” says François Chollet, co-founder of AI firm Ndea, who created the ARC-AGI test. Because such models need to be trained from scratch on each new problem, they are “relatively impractical”, but “I expect a lot more research to come out that will build on top of these results”, he adds.\n\nThe sole author of the paper — Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, an AI researcher at Samsung's Advanced Institute of Technology in Montreal, Canada — says that her model shows that the idea that only massive models that cost millions of dollars to train can succeed at hard tasks “is a trap”. She has made the model’s code openly available on Github for anyone to download and modify. “Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction,” she wrote on her blog.\n\nTiny model, big results\n\nMost reasoning models are built on top of LLMs, which predict the next word in a sequence by tapping into billions of learned internal connections, known as parameters. They excel by memorizing patterns from billions of documents, which can trip them up when they come to unpredictable logic puzzles.\n\nThe TRM takes a different approach. Jolicoeur-Martineau was inspired by a technique known as the hierarchical reasoning model, developed by the AI firm Sapient Intelligence in Singapore. The hierarchical reasoning model improves its answer through multiple iterations and was published in a preprint in June2.\n\nThe TRM uses a similar approach, but uses just 7 million parameters, compared with 27 million for the hierarchical model and billions or trillions for LLMs. For each puzzle type the algorithm learns, such as a sudoku, Jolicoeur-Martineau trained a brain-inspired architecture known as a neural network on around 1,000 examples, formatted as a string of numbers.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide\n\nDuring training, the model guesses the solution and then compares it with the correct answer, before refining its guess and repeating the process. In this way, it learns strategies to improve its guesses. The model then takes a similar approach to solve unseen puzzles of the same type, successively refining its answer up to 16 times before generating a response.",
