      "summary": "Researchers engineered a strained germanium layer on silicon that allows charge to move faster than in any silicon-compatible material to date. This record mobility could lead to chips that run cooler, faster, and with dramatically lower energy consumption. The discovery also enhances the prospects for silicon-based quantum devices.",
      "content": "Scientists from the University of Warwick and the National Research Council of Canada have reported the highest \"hole mobility\" ever measured in a material that works within today's silicon-based semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nSilicon (Si) forms the foundation of most modern semiconductor devices, but as components shrink and are packed closer together, they generate more heat and approach fundamental performance limits. Germanium (Ge), which appeared in some of the earliest transistors of the 1950s, is drawing renewed interest because researchers are finding ways to take advantage of its superior electrical characteristics while retaining the benefits of established silicon production methods.\n\nNew Material Breakthrough Using Strained Germanium on Silicon\n\nIn a study published in Materials Today, a team led by Dr. Maksym Myronov at the University of Warwick demonstrated a major advancement for next-generation electronics. The researchers created a nanometer-thin germanium epilayer on silicon that is placed under compressive strain. This engineered structure enables electric charge to move faster than in any previously known silicon-compatible material.\n\nDr. Maksym Myronov, Associate Professor and leader of the Semiconductors Research Group, Department of Physics, University of Warwick, explains, \"Traditional high-mobility semiconductors such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) are very expensive and impossible to integrate with mainstream silicon manufacturing. Our new compressively strained germanium-on-silicon (cs-GoS) quantum material combines world-leading mobility with industrial scalability -- a key step toward practical quantum and classical large-scale integrated circuits.\"\n\nHow the Team Achieved Ultra-High Mobility\n\nThe researchers created the breakthrough material by growing a thin germanium layer on a silicon wafer and then applying a precise amount of compressive strain. This produced an exceptionally pure and orderly crystal structure that allows electrical charge to pass with minimal resistance.\n\nWhen tested, the material reached a hole mobility of 7.15 million cm2 per volt-second (compared to ~450 cm2 in industrial silicon), an unprecedented result that indicates electrons and holes can travel through it far more easily than through conventional silicon. This improvement could lead to electronic devices that operate more quickly and consume less power.\n\nImplications for Future Electronics and Quantum Technologies\n\nDr. Sergei Studenikin, Principal Research Officer at the National Research Council of Canada, states, \"This sets a new benchmark for charge transport in group-IV semiconductors -- the materials at the heart of the global electronics industry. It opens the door to faster, more energy-efficient electronics and quantum devices that are fully compatible with existing silicon technology.\"\n\nThe findings establish a promising new route for ultra-fast, low-power semiconductor components. Potential uses include quantum information systems, spin qubits, cryogenic controllers for quantum processors, AI accelerators, and energy-efficient servers designed to reduce cooling demands in data centers.\n\nThis achievement also represents a significant accomplishment for Warwick's Semiconductors Research Group and highlights the UK's growing influence in advanced semiconductor materials research.",

      "content": "A researcher from the University of Tokyo and a structural engineer based in the United States have created a computational form-finding method that could reshape how architects and engineers design large, lightweight structures. Their approach is particularly valuable for developing gridshells, which are curved, thin surfaces formed from an interlinked grid of structural members. The method relies on NURBS surfaces, a common format used in computer-aided design (CAD), and significantly lowers the amount of computing power needed. A task that once required 90 hours on a high-end GPU now finishes in about 90 minutes on a standard CPU.\n\nArchitects place high priority on surfaces that can bear their own load. Some visually appealing examples are known as shells, and these have traditionally been made from reinforced concrete. Modern architects, however, are interested in limiting concrete due to its cost, waste, and lack of visual transparency. This has led to growing interest in gridshells, which use intersecting curved elements of metal, glass or timber to span wide areas without interior supports.\n\nWhy Gridshells Are Gaining Interest\n\nGridshells are well suited for covering expansive public spaces without columns. They are found at sites such as train station entrances, restored historic courtyards, and public squares. Notable examples include the British Museum's Great Court, the glass roof at the Dutch Maritime Museum, and New York's Moynihan Train Hall. Although these structures showcase what gridshells can achieve, designers have lacked standard computational tools that can efficiently manage the wide range of shapes they might want to build.\n\nMasaaki Miki of the University of Tokyo and Toby Mitchell from the engineering firm Thornton Tomasetti collaborated to address this gap. Their new algorithm identifies ideal gridshell shapes that support complex geometries while still maintaining structural reliability.\n\nSolving Long-Standing Challenges in Gridshell Design\n\nEven though gridshell projects exist, the many geometric, mechanical, fabrication and construction requirements have made them difficult for most clients to pursue. Miki and Mitchell had already introduced a NURBS-based system capable of addressing many of these issues within one computational framework. However, two major limitations remained: their earlier method struggled with highly irregular shapes, and the computing time required was not practical. The updated method removes these obstacles, creating a more efficient workflow and making advanced gridshell form-finding feasible for a larger group of architects and designers.\n\n\"The project began in 2020 with an interest in shell structures, often made of concrete. Traditional designs aim for shapes that carry their own weight entirely through the force of compression, but this limits how expressive or sculptural they can be,\" said Miki. \"We set out to find new ways to design shells that consider forces of compression as well as tension, allowing greater design freedom. We adapted our approach to more modern metal-and-glass gridshells, developing methods to balance mechanical reliability, aesthetics and ease of construction. Recent advances in computational speed have made it possible to solve such complex conditions using rigorous methods.\"\n\nUsing NURBS to Improve Precision and Speed\n\nA major strength of the new method is that it works directly with NURBS surfaces. Unlike mesh-based approaches that use thousands of triangular pieces, NURBS provide smooth, continuous and mathematically accurate representations of curved surfaces. Because NURBS are already widely used in architectural design, integrating this method into existing workflows is straightforward. The research team created a plug-in for Rhinoceros, a popular NURBS-focused CAD program, allowing architects to use the approach within familiar software.\n\nThe method represents stress distribution on a NURBS surface and uses newly developed algorithms that increase processing speed by 98%. This improvement removes the need for high-end GPUs and provides a more accessible way to generate shapes that meet both geometric and structural requirements. The resulting gridshells remain stable under gravity and support metal-and-glass construction that is practical to assemble.\n\n\"Because we are addressing a real-world problem, we have been rigorously validating our solutions by several test methods we also developed,\" said Miki. \"When the tests revealed failures in the method, it was stressful. However, we are now totally happy because all solutions pass the tests.\"\n\nFuture Directions\n\nWhile the current research focuses on metal-and-glass gridshells, the team plans to expand the technique to include composite timber gridshells in the future.\n\nThis research was partially supported by the Nomura Foundation, the JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI; grant number 23K17784), and JST ASPIRE (grant number JPMJAP2401).",

      "content": "Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr had an ongoing rivalry about the true nature of quantum mechanics, and came up with a thought experiment that could settle the matter. Now, that experiment has finally been performed for real\n\nThe double-slit experiment demonstrates the quantum nature of reality RUSSELL KIGHTLEY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n\nA thought experiment that was at the heart of an argument between famed physicists Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr in 1927 has finally been made real. Its findings elucidate one of the core mysteries of quantum physics: is light really a wave, a particle or a complex mixture of the two?\n\nEinstein and Bohr’s argument concerns the double-slit experiment, which dates back another hundred years to physicist Thomas Young in 1801. Young used this test to argue that light is a wave, while Einstein posited that light is actually a particle. Meanwhile, Bohr’s work in quantum physics boldly proposed that it can, in a sense, be both. Einstein didn’t like this controversial idea and imagined a modified version of Young’s experiment to counter it.\n\nNow, Chao-Yang Lu at the University of Science and Technology of China and his colleagues have performed an experiment that realises Einstein’s idea, using the best tools of modern experimental physics to reveal that quantum objects are as peculiar in their dual wave-and-particle nature as 1920s physicists suspected. “Seeing quantum mechanics ‘in action’ at this fundamental level is simply breathtaking,” says Lu.\n\nIn the classic double-slit experiment, researchers shine light onto a pair of narrow, parallel, horizontally oriented slits positioned in front of a screen. If light were a particle, the screen ought to show a blob of light behind each slit, but Young and countless researchers that followed instead saw an “interference pattern” of alternating dark and light stripes. This indicated that light is more like a wave that spills through the slits, with the screen capturing its ripples clashing into each other. Remarkably, the interference pattern persists even when the light’s intensity is reduced to a single particle of light, or a photon. Does this mean that the perfectly particle-like photon somehow interferes with itself as if it were also a wave?\n\nBohr argued for the notion of “complementarity” where it is impossible to see the photon’s particle-ness when it is exhibiting wavy behaviour and vice versa. In their debates on whether this truly holds, Einstein imagined placing an additional slit before the usual pair that would be equipped with springs, so it could recoil when the photon entered it. Based on the springs’ motion, physicists could then determine whether the photon went through the top or bottom slit. According to Einstein, this would mean being able to simultaneously describe the photon’s particle behaviour – travelling through a specific slit like a tiny ball would – and its wave behaviour as evidenced by the interference pattern, which would contradict complementarity.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Lost in Space-Time Untangle mind-bending physics, maths and the weirdness of reality with our monthly, special-guest-written newsletter. Sign up to newsletter\n\nLu says that his team wanted to build this device at the “ultimate quantum limit”, so they shot a single photon not at a slit, but an atom that could recoil in the same way. Additionally, hitting the atom put the photon into a quantum state equivalent to a mix of moving away from the atom to the left and to the the right, which also produced an interference pattern when it hit a detector. To use an atom in this way, the researchers used lasers and electromagnetic forces to make it incredibly cold, which made it possible to control its quantum properties extremely precisely. This was crucial for testing Bohr’s retort to Einstein: he argued that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which says that if the change in the slit’s momentum from the recoil was known very well then its position would become very fuzzy and vice versa, could destroy the interference pattern.\n\n“Bohr’s counterargument was brilliant. But the thought experiment remained theoretical for almost a century,” says Lu.\n\nBy tuning the lasers, Lu and his colleagues could control the uncertainty in the momentum of the atom-as-slit. In doing so, they found that Bohr’s assertion was correct and they could erase the interference pattern by tweaking the fuzziness of its momentum. Strikingly, the researchers also used this tunability to access a more in-between regime where they could measure some recoil information and also see a blurry version of the interference pattern. Here, the photon was effectively exhibiting both wave and particle properties at once, says Lu.\n\n“The real interest is in [this] in-between,” says Wolfgang Ketterle at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Earlier this year, he and his colleagues carried out a variation of Einstein’s experiment. They used ultracold atoms controlled by lasers to implement a version of Einstein’s experiment where it is the pair of slits that can move. Whereas Lu and his colleagues used a single atom to scatter light in two directions, here, two atoms scattered light in the same direction, and the effect of the photon hitting each atom could be detected from the changes in their quantum states. Ketterle says this is a conceptually different way to probe wave-particle duality and more clearly records what the photon did because this “which-way” information becomes stored in one of the two separate atoms, but it is a slight departure from Einstein’s original idea.\n\nHe and his colleagues also experimented with suddenly turning off their lasers – equivalent to removing the springs from the moveable slits – then shooting photons at the atoms. Bohr’s conclusion still held as the exchange of momentum between the atoms and the photon, plus the uncertainty principle, could still “wash out” the interference pattern’s stripes. This spring-less version of Einstein’s idea hadn’t been tested previously, says Ketterle. “In atomic physics, with cold atoms and lasers, we have real opportunities to showcase quantum mechanics with clarity which was not possible before.”\n\nPhilipp Treutlein at the University of Basel in Switzerland says that the two experiments powerfully showcase some of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. “With our modern understanding, we know the answer to how quantum mechanics works at the microscopic scale. But it always makes a difference if you see it for real, so to speak, if somebody actually does that experiment.” The experiment by Lu and his team conceptually matches the drawings that remain in the historical record of debates between Bohr and Einstein and behaves exactly in the way quantum mechanics predicts it should behave, he says.\n\nFor Lu, there is still more to explore, for example classifying the quantum state of the slit in even more detail, as well as increasing its mass. But the experiment also holds immense educational value. “Above all, I hope it conveys the sheer beauty of quantum mechanics,” he says. “If a few more young people watch the interference pattern appear or disappear in real time and say, “Wow, nature really works like that,” then the experiment has already succeeded.”",

The event pits middle and high school teams against each other as they try to get handmade devices to accomplish a task. NASA/JPL-Caltech The 2025 Invention Challenge at JPL called on teams to build devices capable of moving about 2 gallons (8 liters) of water from a holding reservoir into a bucket about 16 feet (5 meters) away within 60 seconds. Teams at JPL’s 2025 Invention Challenge built their devices with plywood, PVC pipe, duct tape, and even soda cans. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nNow in its 26th year, the event brings teams of middle and high school students to the lab to compete with home-built contraptions.\n\nTeenagers wielding power tools and plywood demonstrated their engineering prowess at the annual Invention Challenge at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California on Friday. Also in evidence: lots of small motors, 3D-printed gears, PVC pipe, and duct tape.\n\nFirst held at JPL in 1998, the event pits middle and high school teams against each other as they try to get handmade devices to accomplish a task that changes annually. For this year’s challenge, dubbed the “Bucket Brigade Contest,” teams needed to create devices capable of moving about 2 gallons (8 liters) of water from a holding reservoir into a bucket about 16 feet (5 meters) away in 60 seconds while satisfying a long list of rules.\n\nArcadia High School’s Team Still Water won first place among student teams in the 2025 Invention Challenge at JPL. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nIn all, 18 teams of students from middle and high schools across Los Angeles and Orange counties competed. First place went to Arcadia High School’s Team Still Water, which completed the task in just 6.45 seconds. Mission Viejo High’s Team Senior Citizens was close behind, finishing in 6.71 seconds. The Samo Seals of Santa Monica High came in third, at 9.18 seconds.\n\nFive teams from outside the area — four from schools in Colorado and Massachusetts and one involving professional engineers — were invited to compete as well. Of those, the team led by retired JPL engineer Alan DeVault’s Team “Trial and Error Engineering” came in first (a repeat from last year). And “Team 6” from Pioneer Charter School of Science in the Boston area took second place (also a repeat performance from 2024). No team qualified for third place.\n\nSome of the devices in the 2025 Invention Challenge at NASA JPL made a big splash. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nJudges named Team Clankers from Mission Viejo High most artistic, Team 6 from Pioneer Charter School of Science most unusual, and Team Winning Engineering Team (WET) from Temple City High most creative.\n\nThe event was supported by dozens of volunteers from JPL staff. JPL Fire Chief Dave Dollarhide, familiar with a bucket brigade, was a guest judge.\n\nNews Media Contact\n\nMelissa Pamer\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n\n626-314-4928\n\nmelissa.pamer@jpl.nasa.gov\n\n2025-135",
