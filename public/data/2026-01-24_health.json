      "title": "Chemotherapy rewires gut bacteria to block metastasis",
      "summary": "Chemotherapy’s gut damage turns out to have a surprising upside. By changing nutrient availability in the intestine, it alters gut bacteria and increases levels of a microbial molecule that travels to the bone marrow. This signal reshapes immune cell production, strengthening anti-cancer defenses and making metastatic sites harder for tumors to colonize. Patient data suggest this immune rewiring is linked to better survival.",
      "content": "Chemotherapy is widely known to damage the lining of the intestines. While this effect is often treated as a localized problem, the consequences extend beyond the digestive tract. When the intestinal lining is injured, the availability of nutrients inside the gut changes, forcing resident bacteria to adapt to a new environment.\n\nResearchers found that damage to the intestinal lining caused by chemotherapy alters how gut bacteria access nutrients. As a result, the makeup and behavior of the microbiota shift. One key change is an increase in the production of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), a microbial compound derived from the amino acid tryptophan.\n\nA Microbial Signal With Bodywide Effects\n\nIPA does not remain confined to the gut. Instead, it acts as a signal that travels through the body to the bone marrow, where immune cells are produced. Higher levels of IPA change this process, altering myelopoiesis and lowering the production of immunosuppressive monocytes. These monocytes normally help cancer cells evade immune defenses and support the growth of metastases.\n\n\"We were surprised by how a side effect often seen as collateral damage of chemotherapy can trigger such a structured systemic response. By reshaping the gut microbiota, chemotherapy sets off a cascade of events that rewires immunity and makes the body less permissive to metastasis,\" says Ludivine Bersier, first author of the study.\n\nThis shift in immune cell production boosts T cell activity and changes how immune cells interact within areas where cancer spreads. The effect is especially clear in the liver. In preclinical models, these changes create conditions that are resistant to metastatic growth.\n\nEvidence From Cancer Patients\n\nThe findings from laboratory studies are supported by patient data. Clinical relevance was confirmed using data collected in collaboration with Dr. Thibaud Koessler (Geneva University Hospitals, HUG). Among patients with colorectal cancer, those with higher levels of IPA in the bloodstream after chemotherapy showed lower monocyte levels. This immune profile is associated with better survival outcomes.\n\n\"This work shows that the effects of chemotherapy extend far beyond the tumor itself. By uncovering a functional axis linking the gut, the bone marrow, and metastatic sites, we highlight systemic mechanisms that could be harnessed to durably limit metastatic progression,\" says Tatiana Petrova, corresponding author of the study.\n\nLong Term Immune Effects and Future Potential\n\nThe research received support from several organizations, including the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Swiss Cancer League. An ISREC Foundation Tandem Grant enabled close collaboration between clinical and basic research, led at Unil by Professor Tatiana Petrova and Dr. Thibaud Koessler at HUG. The team proposes that chemotherapy may create a form of biological \"memory,\" driven by metabolites produced by gut microbes that continue to suppress metastatic growth over time.\n\nTaken together, the results point to a previously underappreciated gut-bone marrow-liver metastasis axis. This pathway helps explain how chemotherapy can produce lasting effects throughout the body and suggests new ways to use microbiota-derived metabolites as supportive strategies to limit the spread of cancer.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Chemotherapy is a common cancer treatment that often harms the lining of the intestines. This damage can affect the gut bacteria living there, but scientists did not fully understand how these changes might influence the body’s defense against cancer.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers discovered that chemotherapy changes the nutrients in the gut, causing certain bacteria to produce more of a molecule called indole-3-propionic acid (IPA). This molecule travels from the gut to the bone marrow, where immune cells are made. Higher IPA levels change how immune cells develop, reducing cells that usually help cancer spread and boosting those that fight it.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows that chemotherapy’s effects go beyond killing cancer cells directly. By reshaping gut bacteria, chemotherapy helps the immune system block cancer from spreading, especially to organs like the liver. Data from patients with colorectal cancer supported this finding, linking higher IPA levels after chemotherapy with better survival.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists want to explore how to use this gut-bone marrow connection to improve cancer treatments.

      "title": "This one gene may explain most Alzheimer’s cases",
      "summary": "Alzheimer’s may be driven far more by genetics than previously thought, with one gene playing an outsized role. Researchers found that up to nine in ten cases could be linked to the APOE gene — even including a common version once considered neutral. The discovery reshapes how scientists think about risk and prevention. It also highlights a major opportunity for new treatments aimed at a single biological pathway.",
      "content": "A new analysis led by researchers at University College London suggests that Alzheimer's disease may depend far more on one gene than previously recognized. The study estimates that more than 90% of Alzheimer's cases might not develop without the influence of a single gene called APOE.\n\nThe researchers also found that the gene's impact extends beyond Alzheimer's alone. Their analysis indicates that nearly half of all dementia cases may also rely on APOE's contribution.\n\nPublished in npj Dementia, the findings point to APOE and the protein it produces as a major yet often overlooked target for drug development. Targeting this gene could open the door to preventing or treating a large share of dementia cases worldwide.\n\nUnderstanding the APOE Gene and Its Variants\n\nScientists have known for decades that APOE is linked to Alzheimer's disease. The gene comes in three common forms, or alleles, called ε2, ε3, and ε4. Each person carries two copies of the gene, which results in six possible combinations* of these variants.\n\nResearch dating back to the 1990s showed that people who carry one or two copies of the ε4 variant face a much higher risk of developing Alzheimer's compared with those who inherit two ε3 copies. By contrast, people with ε2 generally have a lower risk than ε3 carriers.\n\nWhy Scientists Say APOE's Role Has Been Underestimated\n\nLead author Dr. Dylan Williams (UCL Division of Psychiatry and Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL) said: \"We have long underestimated how much the APOE gene contributes to the burden of Alzheimer's disease. The ε4 variant of APOE is well recognized as harmful by dementia researchers, but much disease would not occur without the additional impact of the common ε3 allele, which has been typically misperceived as neutral in terms of Alzheimer's risk.\n\n\"When we consider the contributions of ε3 and ε4, we can see that APOE potentially has a role in almost all Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, if we knew how to reduce the risk that the ε3 and ε4 variants confer to people, we may be able prevent most disease from occurring.\"\n\nThe Largest Modeling Study of APOE's Population Impact\n\nThis research represents the most comprehensive modeling effort so far to estimate how many Alzheimer's and dementia cases across the population are tied to common APOE variants. The team combined evidence linking ε3 and ε4 to Alzheimer's, broader dementia diagnoses, and the brain changes that precede the disease.\n\nA key strength of the analysis was access to data from four very large studies, totaling more than 450,000 participants. This allowed researchers to identify a sizable group of people with two ε2 copies, an uncommon but low risk group, and use them as a baseline for comparison for the first time in this type of study.\n\nHow Much Alzheimer's and Dementia May Depend on APOE\n\nUsing this approach, the researchers estimated that between 72% and 93% of Alzheimer's cases would not have occurred without the ε3 and ε4 variants of APOE. They also concluded that about 45% of all dementia cases may rely on the gene's influence.\n\nThese figures are higher than earlier estimates of APOE's role, largely because this analysis accounted for the effects of both ε3 and ε4 rather than focusing on ε4 alone.\n\nWhy Results Differed Across Studies\n\nThe four studies included in the analysis did not all produce identical results. Differences arose from how Alzheimer's and dementia were defined and measured, such as whether diagnoses were based on medical records, other dementia classifications, or amyloid buildup seen in brain scans. Variation in follow-up time and recruitment methods also played a role.\n\nTaken together, the combined evidence suggests that APOE is likely responsible for at least three quarters of Alzheimer's cases, and possibly more.\n\nImplications for Drug Development and Prevention\n\nThe findings indicate that APOE should become a higher priority in research aimed at understanding disease mechanisms and developing new treatments.\n\nDr. Williams said: \"There has been major progress in recent years in gene editing and other forms of gene therapy to target genetic risk factors directly. Moreover, genetic risk also points us towards parts of our physiology that we could target with more conventional drugs. Intervening on the APOE gene specifically, or the molecular pathway between the gene and the disease, could have great, and probably under-appreciated, potential for preventing or treating a large majority of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"The extent to which APOE has been researched in relation to Alzheimer's or as a drug target has clearly not been proportionate to its full importance.\"\n\nGenetics Is Powerful but Not the Whole Story\n\nDespite APOE's strong influence, it is not the sole cause of Alzheimer's or other dementias. Even among people in the highest risk group, those with two ε4 copies, lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease remains below 70%.\n\nAs Dr. Williams explained: \"Most people with genetic risk factors like APOE ε3 and ε4 won't get dementia in a typical lifetime, since there are complicated interactions at play with other contributing genetic and environmental risk factors. Understanding what modifies the risk people inherit from their APOE genes is another crucial question for dementia researchers to grapple with.\n\n\"For instance, other research has suggested that perhaps half of dementia incidence could be prevented or delayed by improving many modifiable risk factors such as social isolation, high cholesterol or smoking, across populations.** With complex diseases like Alzheimer's and other diseases that cause dementia, there will be more than one way to reduce disease occurrence. We should explore many options by which we might modify Alzheimer's and dementia risk, including but not limited to strategies related to APOE.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we should not overlook the fact that without the contributions of APOE ε3 and ε4, most Alzheimer's disease cases would not occur, irrespective of what other factors are inherited or experienced by carriers of these variants throughout life.\"\n\nStudy Support and Expert Reaction\n\nThe study was carried out by researchers at UCL and the University of Eastern Finland and received funding from Alzheimer's Research UK, the Medical Research Council, and other organizations.\n\nDr. Sheona Scales, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"This study highlights that more Alzheimer's cases are linked to the APOE gene that previously thought. However, not everyone with these variants will develop Alzheimer's, demonstrating the complex relationship between genetics and other risk factors for dementia.\n\n\"Despite APOE being linked to Alzheimer's, very few treatments in clinical trials target this gene directly. Findings from this study show that further research into APOE will be important for developing future prevention and treatment strategies for Alzheimer's.\n\n\"Alzheimer's Research UK is delighted to support Dr. Williams as he continues to investigate how genetics alongside environmental and societal factors influence dementia risk, which will ultimately bring us closer to a cure.\"\n\nWhy APOE Variants Raise Dementia Risk\n\nEarlier research suggests that the ε4 variant may raise dementia risk because the protein it produces is less effective at clearing amyloid-beta (a sticky protein that forms plaques). It also interferes with how brain cells manage fats and energy and promotes inflammation, which may gradually damage neurons and increase vulnerability to Alzheimer's and related dementias. More research is needed to confirm these processes and to explain why ε3 raises dementia risk compared with ε2.\n\nNotes\n\n* The six combinations of the APOE gene are: ε2+ε2; ε2+ε3; ε2+ε4; ε3+ε3; ε3+ε4; ε4+ε4. The variants are referred to as APOE2, APOE3, APOE4 in relation to APOE protein type.\n\n** The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care 2024",

      "title": "A brain glitch may explain why some people hear voices",
      "summary": "New research suggests that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia may come from a brain glitch that confuses inner thoughts for external voices. Normally, the brain predicts the sound of its own inner speech and tones down its response. But in people hearing voices, brain activity ramps up instead, as if the voice belongs to someone else. The discovery could help scientists develop early warning signs for psychosis.",
      "content": "A new study led by psychologists at UNSW Sydney offers the clearest evidence so far that hearing voices in schizophrenia may arise from a breakdown in how the brain recognizes its own inner voice. The research suggests that the brain may be misidentifying internally generated thoughts as sounds coming from the outside world.\n\nPublished in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin, the study also points toward a possible path for identifying biological markers of schizophrenia. This is important because there are currently no blood tests, brain scans, or lab based biomarkers (signs in the body that can tell us something about our health) that uniquely identify the condition.\n\nProfessor Thomas Whitford of the UNSW School of Psychology has spent years studying how inner speech works in both healthy individuals and people living with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.\n\n\"Inner speech is the voice in your head that silently narrates your thoughts - what you're doing, planning, or noticing,\" he says.\n\n\"Most people experience inner speech regularly, often without realizing it, though there are some who don't experience it at all.\n\n\"Our research shows that when we speak - even just in our heads - the part of the brain that processes sounds from the outside world becomes less active. This is because the brain predicts the sound of our own voice. But in people who hear voices, this prediction seems to go wrong, and the brain reacts as if the voice is coming from someone else.\"\n\nBrainwaves Reveal a Longstanding Theory\n\nAccording to Prof. Whitford, these findings strongly support a theory that has existed in mental health research for decades: that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia may result from a person's own inner speech being mistaken for external speech.\n\n\"This idea's been around for 50 years, but it's been very difficult to test because inner speech is inherently private,\" he says.\n\n\"How do you measure it? One way is by using an EEG, which records the brain's electrical activity. Even though we can't hear inner speech, the brain still reacts to it - and in healthy people, using inner speech produces the same kind of reduction in brain activity as when they speak out loud.\n\n\"But in people who hear voices, that reduction of activity doesn't happen. In fact, their brains react even more strongly to inner speech, as if it's coming from someone else. That might help explain why the voices feel so real.\"\n\nTesting How the Brain Predicts Sound\n\nTo explore this effect, the researchers divided participants into three groups. The first included 55 people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who had experienced auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) within the past week. The second group included 44 people with schizophrenia who either had no history of AVH or had not experienced them recently. The third group consisted of 43 healthy individuals with no history of schizophrenia.\n\nEach participant wore an EEG (electroencephalography) cap while listening to sounds through headphones. At specific moments, they were asked to imagine saying either 'bah' or 'bih' silently in their minds while hearing one of those same sounds played aloud. Participants did not know in advance whether the sound they imagined would match what they heard.\n\nIn healthy participants, brain activity dropped when the imagined syllable matched the sound played through the headphones. This reduced response appeared in the auditory cortex, the region responsible for processing sound and speech. The pattern suggests the brain correctly predicted the sound and lowered its response, similar to what happens during normal speech.\n\nThe opposite pattern appeared in participants who had recently experienced auditory hallucinations. Instead of showing reduced activity, their brains reacted more strongly when the imagined sound matched what they heard.\n\n\"Their brains reacted more strongly to inner speech that matched the external sound, which was the exact opposite of what we found in the healthy participants,\" Prof. Whitford says.\n\n\"This reversal of the normal suppression effect suggests that the brain's prediction mechanism may be disrupted in people currently experiencing auditory hallucinations, which may cause their own inner voice to be misinterpreted as external speech.\"\n\nParticipants in the second schizophrenia group, those without recent hallucinations, showed brain responses that fell between the healthy group and the hallucinating group.\n\nWhat This Means for Schizophrenia Research\n\nThe researchers say the results provide the strongest confirmation yet that people living with schizophrenia may be experiencing imagined speech as if it were coming from outside themselves.\n\n\"It was always a plausible theory - that people were hearing their own thoughts spoken out loud - but this new approach has provided the strongest and most direct test of this theory to date,\" Prof. Whitford says.\n\nLooking ahead, the research team plans to explore whether this brain response pattern could help predict who may later develop psychosis. If successful, it could help identify individuals at high risk earlier, allowing treatment to begin sooner.\n\n\"This sort of measure has great potential to be a biomarker for the development of psychosis,\" Prof. Whitford says.\n\n\"Ultimately, I think that understanding the biological causes of the symptoms of schizophrenia is a necessary first step if we hope to develop new and effective treatments.\"",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Muchas personas con esquizofrenia escuchan voces que otros no oyen. Los científicos han pensado durante mucho tiempo que estas voces podrían ser los propios pensamientos de la persona confundidos con sonidos externos, pero era difícil probarlo.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigadores de UNSW Sydney estudiaron la actividad cerebral de personas con esquizofrenia y personas sanas. Usando cascos EEG, pidieron a los participantes imaginar silenciosamente sonidos mientras escuchaban sonidos similares por auriculares. En personas sanas, la respuesta cerebral a los sonidos esperados disminuía, pero en quienes escuchaban voces, la actividad cerebral aumentaba. Esto muestra que sus cerebros pueden confundir el habla interna con voces reales externas.\n\n**Impacto** – Este estudio ofrece la evidencia más clara hasta ahora de que las alucinaciones auditivas provienen de una confusión dentro del cerebro. También sugiere una nueva forma de encontrar signos biológicos, o biomarcadores, de la esquizofrenia. Estos biomarcadores podrían ayudar a los médicos a identificar la enfermedad antes, antes de que los síntomas sean graves.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores quieren ver si este patrón de actividad cerebral puede predecir quién podría desarrollar psicosis más adelante. Si funciona, los médicos podrían usar esta prueba para detectar la esquizofrenia temprano y comenzar el tratamiento antes, mejorando la vida de las personas.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Un estudio cerebral muestra que escuchar voces en la esquizofrenia puede ocurrir porque el cerebro confunde pensamientos internos con sonidos externos, abriendo puertas a un diagnóstico y tratamiento más temprano.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nSexual health is getting a long-overdue upgrade. Thanks to recent approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, at-home STD testing is more accessible than ever, and it’s arriving alongside the first new gonorrhea treatments in decades. For public health experts, the timing couldn’t be better.\n\nAfter years of climbing infection rates and pandemic-related disruptions to testing and treatment, these changes offer a hopeful shift. And while many challenges like high costs and public health funding cuts remain, the convenience and privacy of testing from home could help remove key barriers for people hesitant to get screened.\n\n“Sexual health can be stigmatized and people can be hesitant about testing,” said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. “Now we have a lot of options for patients who may be wary of going into a provider’s office.”\n\nHome testing is fast, private and accurate\n\nLast year, FDA approved Visby Medical’s all-in-one, at-home test that screens for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis in women. The test includes a vaginal swab and a small diagnostic device. After collecting a sample, users upload a photo of the results to an app and can receive a telehealth consultation and prescription within as little as six hours.\n\nDr. Gary Schoolnik, Visby’s chief medical officer and a professor emeritus at Stanford, explained why that matters: “Many patients are very hard to track down and a lot of them, if they have a positive test result, are never treated and are lost to follow-up.” The streamlined model addresses this problem head-on.\n\nThe device was shown to detect the three infections with accuracy rates around 98 percent. That’s comparable to traditional lab tests, but it only costs $150. While not currently covered by insurance, it includes follow-up medical support and prescription access.\n\nOther tests are designed to work with existing lab systems. Teal Health’s HPV self-collection kit, also approved by the FDA last year, allows users to collect a sample with the Teal Wand, ship it to a lab, and receive results from a provider. For the first time, federal guidelines now endorse self-collection for HPV screening—an important milestone in cervical cancer prevention.\n\nNew gonorrhea drugs offer promising alternatives\n\nOn the treatment side, another significant breakthrough has occurred; the FDA also approved two new oral medications for gonorrhea after years of limited options: Nuzolvenc and Bluejepa.\n\nBoth drugs can be taken by mouth, a notable improvement over the current go-to: an injection of ceftriaxone. The rise of drug-resistant gonorrhea has been a major concern, especially after the CDC dropped oral azithromycin from its guidelines due to resistance concerns.\n\n“We were down to one class of antibiotics recommended to treat gonorrhea and we had no other good options,” Park said. “So to have two new options in the same year is very exciting.”\n\nThese drugs bring new hope in managing a notoriously adaptive infection that has become harder to treat over time.\n\nThe impact is already being felt\n\nAccording to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, STD rates are starting to decline. Gonorrhea cases have dropped for three consecutive years, and the most infectious forms of syphilis and adult cases of chlamydia have also seen a dip.\n\nExperts point to multiple factors: less sexual activity among younger populations, a growing interest in “morning-after” antibiotics to prevent STDs, and wider access to at-home screening. While home testing is still relatively new, it’s beginning to reshape how people approach sexual health.\n\nStill, experts caution that the shift to home testing could make tracking national infection rates more complicated. Many public health databases rely on centralized lab reporting, something not always captured when tests are done at home.\n\nAnother concern is cost and access. Tests like Visby’s $150 kit, while convenient, may be out of reach for lower-income individuals. And with recent funding cuts to the CDC and other public health agencies, there’s fear that the people who could benefit most from these innovations may be the last to access them.\n\n“I’m feeling very optimistic about the fact that people have more testing options and also that we now have access to new drugs,” Park said. “What I fear is these cuts to public health are going to decrease access to sexual health care for populations who can least afford to take advantage of these new options.”\n\nDid this solution stand out?
