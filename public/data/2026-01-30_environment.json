      "title": "A breakthrough that turns exhaust CO2 into useful materials",
      "summary": "Scientists have created a device that captures carbon dioxide and transforms it into a useful chemical in a single step. The new electrode works with realistic exhaust gases rather than requiring purified CO2. It converts the captured gas into formic acid, which is used in energy and manufacturing. The system even functions at CO2 levels found in normal air.",
      "content": "Exhaust gases from home furnaces, fireplaces, and industrial facilities release carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into the air, contributing to pollution. Scientists reporting in ACS Energy Letters have developed a new type of electrode designed to address this problem by capturing CO 2 directly from the air and turning it into a useful chemical called formic acid. In testing, the system outperformed existing electrode technologies when exposed to simulated flue gas and when operating at CO 2 levels similar to those found in the atmosphere.\n\n\"This work shows that carbon capture and conversion do not need to be treated as separate steps. By integrating both functions into a single electrode, we demonstrate a simpler pathway for CO 2 utilization under realistic gas conditions,\" explains Wonyong Choi, a corresponding author on the study.\n\nWhy CO 2 Conversion Has Been So Difficult\n\nPulling carbon dioxide out of the air may seem straightforward, especially since plants do it naturally. The greater challenge lies in transforming that captured gas into something useful, a step that is essential if carbon capture technologies are to be widely adopted. In real industrial exhaust, CO 2 is usually mixed with other gases, including nitrogen and oxygen. Most existing conversion systems only work efficiently when carbon dioxide has already been separated and concentrated, which limits their practicality.\n\nTo overcome this obstacle, Donglai Pan, Myoung Hwan Oh, Wonyong Choi, and their colleagues set out to build a system that could operate under realistic conditions. Their goal was to create a device capable of handling flue gas as it is actually produced and converting even small amounts of captured CO 2 into a valuable product.\n\nInside the Three Layer Electrode\n\nThe research team designed an electrode that allows gas to pass through it, trap carbon dioxide, and convert it at the same time. The device is made up of three layers: a material that captures CO 2 , a sheet of gas permeable carbon paper, and a catalytic layer of tin(IV) oxide. Together, these components enable the direct conversion of carbon dioxide gas into formic acid.\n\nFormic acid is an important chemical used in a range of applications, including fuel cells and other industrial processes. Producing it directly from exhaust gases could make carbon reuse more practical and cost effective.\n\nStrong Results Under Real World Conditions\n\nWhen tested with pure CO 2 gas, the new electrode showed about 40% higher efficiency than existing carbon conversion electrodes under similar laboratory conditions. The advantage became even clearer when researchers used a simulated flue gas containing 15% CO 2 , 8% oxygen gas, and 77% nitrogen gas. Under these conditions, the new system continued to generate substantial amounts of formic acid, while other technologies produced very little.\n\nThe electrode also proved capable of capturing carbon dioxide at concentrations similar to those found in the atmosphere, showing that it can function in ambient air. According to the researchers, this approach offers a promising path toward integrating carbon capture into real industrial applications. They also suggest that similar designs could eventually be adapted to capture and convert other greenhouse gases, including methane.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

      "title": "Solar farms can be havens for rare plants. Just ask the threecorner milkvetch.",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "The ostensibly barren Mojave Desert is in fact teeming with plants and animals, including a rare species known as the threecorner milkvetch. It’s a member of the pea family, splaying across the ground instead of climbing up a garden trestle. Given the harsh desert conditions, it waits until the arrival of rains to burst from the earth — flowering, fruiting, and reproducing.\n\nThough hardy, the threecorner milkvetch — which is under consideration for listing under the Endangered Species Act — and its fellow species in the Mojave are still sensitive to disturbance, like when solar farms literally break ground. Traditionally, energy companies “blade and grade” habitats, meaning they cut out vegetation and even out the soil, which disrupts the seed banks stored within the ground.\n\nIn the desert outside of Las Vegas, the Gemini Solar Project took a gentler approach, instead trying to preserve the ecosystem. According to a new study, it paid off for the threecorner milkvetch: Before the development, scientists found 12 plants on the site, and afterward in 2024 found 93, signifying that the seeds survived construction. Compared to a nearby plot of land, the plants at Gemini grew wider and taller, and produced more flowers and fruits. That might be because the solar panels shade the soil, slowing evaporation, which makes more water available to the plants to grow big and strong. “So you just have the potential for a lot more plants,” said Tiffany Pereira, an ecologist at the Desert Research Institute and lead author of the paper, which was published late last year. “There’s seedlings of so many other species coming up as well. And so the fact that seed bank survived is phenomenal.”\n\nPlants grow among panels in the Gemini Solar Project, outside Las Vegas. Courtesy of Tiffany Pereira\n\nIt’s yet more evidence that solar farms can be built in ways that minimize disturbances to ecosystems. (The company behind the Gemini project, Primergy, did not respond to requests for comment.) This technique is called ecovoltaics: Instead of blade-and-grade, facilities are built with native species in mind. To give the ecosystem a boost, for instance, a crew can seed the soils with native grasses and flowers. “Some of those seed mixes do quite well at solar facilities, and they attract pollinators, birds, and other wildlife as a result,” said Lee Walston, an ecologist at Argonne National Laboratory who wasn’t involved in the new paper. “Sort of asking that umbrella, Field of Dreams, question, right: If you build it, will they come?”\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nIn Minnesota, at least, the answer is yes. Walston led a study of two solar sites on converted cropland there, observing the growth of biodiversity over the course of five years. The researchers found that the number of unique flowering plant species increased sevenfold, and the abundance of insect pollinators tripled. Native bees alone increased by 20 times. In a follow-on study across a dozen solar sites, grassland birds flocked to the areas, likely attracted by the abundance of insects — same goes for bats. Birds could also nest among the panels, hiding from predators. “We’ve seen positive outcomes, sort of across the board,” Walston said. “Anytime that you’re seeing increases in insect prey, you’ve got at least a really strong potential for also seeing greater bird activity and bat activity, as they are attracted to those sites.”\n\nSuch a significant boost to biodiversity is not a given, though. Certain plant species will need more or less shade from the panels: In the Mojave, Pereira only found one threecorner milkvetch, for example, growing directly under a panel. The rest were popping up in the sunnier spaces between them. Young plants of other species, by contrast, might prefer shadier spots, because too much sunlight can stress them.\n\nAn ecovoltaic project teems with flowers, which attract native pollinating species. Courtesy of Lee Walston\n\nPanel height is a major factor, too: Taller ones let bigger plant species grow to their full potential — but the higher the supports, the more a solar company must spend on materials. A facility might also set a specific height to accommodate livestock like sheep and goats, used for “conservation grazing” to clear out invasive weeds, which in turn reduces the fire risk of dead plants. “We’re trying to work with developers,” Walston said, “to say, ‘OK, well, if all you can do is 2 feet, what might be the best mix of seed mixes and management styles that could really optimize the habitat?’”\n\nThat mowing might sound destructive, but it mimics the natural order of things, as grazers like deer and buffalo, in addition to wildfires, have historically served the same purpose. Ecovoltaics can also return former agricultural fields to more of their natural state. “I think there is real potential for solar farms to be especially good for biodiversity in prairie ecosystems, since prairies evolved over time to require repeated disturbance,” said Johanna Neumann, senior director of the Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy at the nonprofit Environment America, who wasn’t involved in the new research.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nThe blade-and-grade alternative, on the other hand, doesn’t just disrupt a habitat. With native plant species cleared out, the earth loses the root structures that keep soils from blowing away. Then, opportunistic and fast-growing invasive species can take over, muscling out the natives. And their flowers might not be as enticing for indigenous pollinators like bumblebees.\n\nJust as endemic plants can grow among solar panels, so too can crops, a technique known as agrivoltaics. Researchers are finding, for example, that things like cucumbers grow like crazy on rooftops. The panels create a unique microclimate that keeps crops from getting too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter, and uses about one-third of the water compared to growing in full sun. Now scientists are trying to figure out which crops — especially high-value ones that can make up the cost of installing solar — will do the best growing under panels, both on rooftops and on the ground. “If you’re going to grow something, you want to grow something that a potential farmer could sell for decent profit,” said horticulturist Jennifer Bousselot, who studies rooftop agrivoltaics at Colorado State University but wasn’t involved in the new paper. “You name the crop, and there’s interest.”\n\nAll told, ecovoltaics and agrivoltaics have the potential to bolster biodiversity and the food supply while generating clean electricity. “Rather than a moonscape of invasive species and dust blowing into cities, why not strive for something better?” Pereira said. “It’s a wild and beautiful place that we live in, and it’s our job to look out for these species as well.”",

      "content": "The decline of lions and pandas often captures global attention, but a quieter and potentially more damaging crisis is unfolding among small mammals. These tiny animals are disappearing at alarming rates, and their loss can have outsized consequences for biodiversity. Small mammals are powerful indicators of environmental health, yet tracking them has long been a challenge because many species occupy different ecological roles while looking almost exactly alike.\n\nResearchers have now developed a new way to identify and monitor these animals by analyzing their footprints. The method was tested on two nearly indistinguishable species of sengi and achieved accuracy rates as high as 96 percent, offering a promising new tool for conservation science.\n\n\"We had two key motivations for undertaking this study,\" said Dr. Zoë Jewell of Duke University Nicholas School of the Environment, co-author of the article in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. \"Firstly, to find a better, more ethical, and more scientifically robust way to monitor even the tiniest species, and secondly, to provide a reliable and broad metric for ecosystem integrity that can be applied routinely and regularly -- a new pulse on the planet.\"\n\nWhy Small Mammals Matter\n\nDespite their size, small mammals play essential roles in ecosystems and respond quickly to environmental change. Because of this sensitivity, shifts in their populations can serve as early warning signs of ecological disruption. Monitoring them accurately, however, is difficult. Many are what scientists call cryptic species, meaning they are visually almost impossible to tell apart.\n\nThis challenge is illustrated by the two species used to test the new footprint technique: Eastern Rock sengis and Bushveld sengis. Although they appear nearly identical, they live in different habitats and face different environmental pressures.\n\n\"It's often only possible to distinguish between cryptic species using DNA, which can be slow, invasive, and costly,\" explained Jewell. \"It's really important to know which is which, because although these species might look the same, they face different environmental threats and play different roles in the environment. For example, in our study, one of the sengis lives exclusively in rocky habitats and the other on sand, and each can act independently as an indicator in those environments.\"\n\nHow Footprints Reveal Species Identity\n\nWhile the two sengi species look alike, their feet are not exactly the same. Subtle differences in foot shape leave distinct patterns in the tracks they make. The research team focused on capturing and analyzing these differences, training a computer model to recognize which footprints belonged to which species.\n\nBy treating footprint identification like a digital tracking problem, the scientists aimed to replace invasive and expensive monitoring methods with a faster and more practical alternative.\n\nFieldwork in South Africa\n\nThe researchers collected sengis from two locations in South Africa: Telperion Nature Reserve and Tswalu Kalahari Reserve. All 18 Bushveld sengis were found at Tswalu, while 19 Eastern Rock sengis were identified across both sites. Some of the Eastern Rock sengis were living very close to Bushveld sengis, a surprising result since Tswalu Kalahari Reserve lies outside the species' expected range.\n\nThis unexpected overlap underscored the importance of better monitoring tools, as species may be expanding or shifting their ranges without being detected.\n\nThe animals were captured using specially-designed traps filled with soft bedding and food, including oats, peanut butter, and Marmite -- which they find particularly delicious -- before being transferred to a footprint collection box. Inside the box, special paper and charcoal dust encouraged the sengis to walk across the surface, leaving clear tracks behind. Each animal was then released unharmed at its original capture site.\n\nTurning Tracks Into Data\n\nHigh-resolution images of the footprints were analyzed using morphometry software that measured shape and size characteristics. The researchers focused on front footprints, which consistently provided the clearest and most distinctive features. More than 100 potential measurements were initially identified.\n\nStatistical testing was then used to determine which combination of features most effectively separated the two species.\n\nAccuracy Without Invasive Methods\n\nFrom this analysis, nine key footprint features were selected and tested against previously unseen images and sets of tracks. Across all trials, the system correctly identified the species 94 percent to 96 percent of the time.\n\nThe results show that footprint analysis can offer a simple, affordable, and non-invasive way to confirm species presence and track changes in population size and geographic range. The research team plans to expand the approach to other species by training new models with additional datasets. They also hope to compare footprint analysis with other non-invasive monitoring techniques to see how different tools can work together.\n\n\"Small mammals exist in almost every ecosystem on the planet, and our tech is flexible enough to adapt to every one,\" said Jewell.",

      "content": "In recent years, many of us have learned that “recyclable” isn’t as simple as we once thought. The single-use coffee cup is the classic example: its paper shell is fused with a thin plastic liner, rendering it un-recyclable in most facilities. It’s a “composite material,” a mix of things that are too difficult to separate.\n\nA surprisingly similar, and often-overlooked, challenge is sitting in our homes: old sunglasses.\n\nJust like that coffee cup, eyewear is a complex fusion of materials. Metal hinges are screwed into polymer frames, which hold chemically-coated lenses. This mix of metals, plastics, and coatings means standard sorting machines cannot process them. As a result, they are rejected as contamination and sent directly to landfills, where they contribute to non-biodegradable waste. Unlike a disposable paper cup, however, a pair of sunglasses is built for durability. Its high-quality components make it a perfect candidate for repair, reuse, or reinvention.\n\nThis guide provides 7 actionable alternatives to the landfill, designed to turn this difficult-to-recycle item into a valuable, circular resource.\n\n1. The Most Impactful Fix: Replace the Lenses\n\nFor the most common issue—scratched or damaged lenses—the most sustainable answer is also the simplest. The frame, which is the most resource-intensive part to produce, is often in perfect condition. By focusing on a “repair, don’t replace” model, you can save an entire item from the landfill.\n\nAction: This process is now easier than ever. Specialist companies like mine, The Sunglass Fix, allow you to order high-quality, precision-cut replacement lenses for thousands of models online. You can effectively restore your sunglasses to brand-new condition for a fraction of the cost—and with significantly less waste.\n\n2. The Charitable Solution: Donate for Global Reuse\n\nIf your sunglasses are still in good shape, don’t let them go to waste. Just because you don’t wear them anymore doesn’t mean they are finished. By donating them, you give them a second life. There are millions of people who need eye protection but can’t easily buy it. Your old pair could end up helping someone see better and protect their eyes every day.”\n\nAction: There are great groups ready to take them:\n\nLions Clubs International : The most famous option. Look for their yellow collection boxes in libraries and local vision centers.\n\nOneSight : They run clinics to bring eyewear directly to communities that need it most.\n\nReSpectacle: An easy website that matches your specific glasses to a person who needs them.\n\n3. The DIY Solution: Simple Home Maintenance\n\nBefore giving up on a pair, inspect it closely. Many “broken” sunglasses are merely suffering from minor, fixable issues. A wobbly arm or a missing nose pad might seem like a fatal flaw, but a simple home repair can often make them perfectly wearable again, saving you money and preventing waste.\n\nAction: Most common issues can be solved with a basic eyeglass repair kit.\n\nTighten Loose Screws: This is the most common issue. Using a precision screwdriver, gently tighten the hinge screws until the arms feel secure again. If a screw is lost, most repair kits come with standard replacements.\n\nAdjust Bent Frames: If your glasses sit crooked on your face, place them on a flat table to see which side is lifted. Metal frames can be gently bent back into shape with your fingers. Plastic frames should be warmed slightly (with warm water) before you gently twist them back to alignment.\n\nReplace Old Nose Pads: If the pads are yellowing, uncomfortable, or missing, don’t toss the glasses. You can buy standard silicone replacements online. They either snap in or screw in, instantly making the glasses feel cleaner and more comfortable.\n\nFix Stiff Hinges: If the arms are hard to open or make a grinding sound, the hinge is likely clogged with dirt. Wash the frame with warm soapy water to flush out the grit. Once dry, a tiny drop of baby oil or lubricant on the hinge will make it move smoothly again.\n\nRestore Faded Plastic: If your plastic frames have turned white or cloudy, they aren’t ruined; they are just oxidized. You can buff this white layer off using a soft microfiber cloth and a little friction (or a tiny dab of non-abrasive car wax) to reveal the shiny, fresh plastic underneath.\n\n4. The Upcycling Solution: Create Unique Decor\n\nEven when lenses are damaged beyond repair or frames are no longer wearable, the components themselves can be valuable materials for DIY home décor. Instead of sitting in a landfill for centuries, these plastic and metal parts can be upcycled into unique art pieces, giving new purpose to materials that would otherwise decompose.\n\nAction: Re-frame your perspective and use the components for home decor. Multiple pairs can be combined to create a unique mirror frame, a 3D collage, or other decorative wall art, as highlighted by various home design blogs.\n\n5. The Craft Solution: Fashion Custom Jewelry\n\nThe trend of upcycling fashion accessories is growing, and sunglasses offer endless possibilities. The colorful or mirrored lenses, in particular, can be transformed into new items. This craft-based approach turns a waste product into a one-of-a-kind wearable statement of sustainability.\n\nAction: Gently pop the lenses out of the frames. They can be incorporated into unique DIY projects. Craft blogs demonstrate how to fashion them into pendants or one-of-a-kind earrings, completely upcycling the component.\n\n6. The Garden Solution: Repurpose Components Outdoors\n\nEven the most shattered parts can find a new purpose outdoors. The sturdy plastic or metal arms of a frame, for example, make surprisingly durable and waterproof plant markers for a garden or herb pot. Other broken pieces can be used for mosaics or small sculptures, offering a quirky way to bring sustainability to your backyard.\n\nAction: Remove the sturdy plastic or metal arms from the frame. By writing on them with a permanent marker, you can create durable, waterproof, and quirky plant markers for an herb garden or seed-starting trays.\n\n7. The Final Step: Responsible Material Separation\n\nIf the sunglasses are beyond saving and none of the above methods apply, you must handle the final disposal process manually. Recycling plants are designed to handle simple items like bottles or cans, not complex “mixed material” objects like eyewear. If you throw a whole pair of sunglasses into the mix, it is treated as contamination and sent to the landfill. If you want the materials to live on, you have to do the separation work that the machines can’t.\n\nAction: Break the frame down into these four categories to ensure they get recycled:\n\nPop the Lenses Out: Press firmly on the back of the lens to snap it out of the frame. Even if the lens itself cannot be recycled locally, removing it is the essential first step to preparing the rest of the frame.\n\nStrip the Hardware: Use a precision screwdriver to remove the arms, hinges, and any nose pads. You need to fully separate every piece of metal from the plastic components.\n\nConsolidate the Metal: The tiny screws and hinges are valuable scrap, but they are too small for machines to catch. Place them inside a larger steel food can (like a soup can) and pinch the top closed so they are trapped inside and can be processed safely.\n\nMail the Frames: The stripped plastic frames are now ready for a specialist. Since standard curbside trucks typically reject rigid eyewear plastics, mail these specific parts to dedicated programs like Terracycle or Banish that can shred and repurpose them.\n\nRedefining “Waste” in Your Wardrobe\n\nA single-use coffee cup is a symbol of a disposable mindset—a product designed for a single use. In contrast, an old pair of sunglasses, once destined for the landfill, is a collection of durable materials and untapped potential.\n\nBy shifting how we view worn or damaged items, we can begin to see them not as waste, but as resources waiting for renewal. Moving beyond the linear “take-make-waste” model unlocks that value. Whether you choose to remanufacture your favorite frames, donate them, or upcycle them into a new project, each action contributes to a more sustainable future.\n\nSmall changes, repeated by millions, can make a measurable difference. Just as we’ve learned to carry a reusable mug, we can learn to repair our most-loved items. The next time you reach for that scratched pair, remember—repairing or reimagining them isn’t just creative; it’s part of building a more circular world.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nThis sponsored article was contributed by Craig Anderson, founder of The Sunglass Fix.
