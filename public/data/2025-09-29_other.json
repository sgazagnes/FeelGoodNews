Indeed, they are some of the most picturesque examples in the Netherlands, and easy to get to from Amsterdam. Last year, 2.6 million people visited - a gigantic amount for a small place with a resident population of just 100. It is far too many tourists, says the local council. And so, it has announced that from next spring it will charge every visitor from outside the area €17.50 ($20.50; £15) to enter, to try to control the numbers. It's very rare for a community to take such a measure, but talking to Marieke Verweij, director of the village's museum, you can understand why they want to do this. \"In 2017 we had 1.7 million visitors… this year we're heading for 2.8 million,\" she says. \"But this is a small place! We just don't have room for all these people!\" Worse, says Marieke Verweij, visitors often \"don't know that people live here so they walk into their gardens, they walk into their houses, they pee into their gardens, they knock on doors, they take pictures, they use selfie sticks to peek into the houses. So no privacy at all.\"\n\nI leave the museum and walk past a coach car park in the general direction of the windmills. I probably shouldn't say this, as it's just going to make the problem worse, but these are some fabulous windmills. One of them is wooden and painted green. Another has thatched walls. Every so often the wind picks up and their sails go round. It's a fine sight - and one most people would want to get a picture with. A lot of people are doing just that, of course. The windmills are actually still quite a long way off but, at the best spots, visitors form very civilised selfie-queues. There's a bit of a queue also at a little bridge that leads over a canal towards the windmills. As I edge forward I hear Chinese, English, Spanish, Arabic, Italian and Russian. The plan is to get everyone to book and pay online. The sort of thing you often have to do now to visit museums post-Covid. The sweetener for tourists is that for the €17.50 they get admission to two things they currently have to pay for separately anyway – entry to the museum and to the inside of the windmills. The former contains a painting of the local windmills by French impressionist Claude Monet, who visited in 1871. In the latter you can see how, in the 17th Century, the Dutch were using windmills not just to grind grain, but to do things like grind pigments to make paint or saw wood.\n\nThe villagers complain of people walking into their homes\n\nIf only half the current numbers keep visiting after the admission charge is introduced, annual revenues will be around €24.5m. The council plans to spend the money on maintenance of the windmills and on new infrastructure. New toilets, for example. But the shop and restaurant owners are not happy at all. The stores, it should be said, are a bit of an attraction in themselves. The staff wear traditional costumes in the cheese shop, they do clog-making demonstrations in the shoe store. And they are located inside old and beautiful wooden houses. The antique and gift shop for example, dates from 1623. The planned entrance charge is threatening the livelihoods of Zaanse Schans's retailers and restaurant-owners, says Sterre Schaap. She co-runs the gift shop, which is called Trash and Treasures. \"It's awful. It will mean that people who don't have a big wallet won't be able to come here,\" says Ms Schaap. \"It will mean that we will lose a lot of our shoppers. \"If you're with a family of four and you have parking, it will be around €100. So people won't have a lot of budget over for other stuff.\"\n\nThe village shops, where staff wear traditional outfits, fear a big drop in business\n\nI wander up to the windmills, past a young woman who's photographing her friend, and a couple from Germany who are taking a selfie. Up on the balcony of one of the windmills, looking out at the impressive flatness of Holland, I get talking to Ishan from Canada. \"I don't know if I'd pay the €17.50 to come here. It's a bit steep just to see a couple of windmills,\" he says. But Elisia, who is Albanian, grew up in Greece, and now lives in the Netherlands, says she would definitely pay that amount. \"These villages, they are not so big and they lose their charm when there are so many tourists,\" she says. Steve, who's over with his family from Massachusetts in the US, has been doing his calculations and can see the good side of the upcoming charge. \"Cheap people like me,\" says Steve, \"look at the windmill and say 'nah, I'm not gonna pay extra to go in there', but if it's all included I wouldn't hesitate.\" It'd be a more complete experience, he says, and not a bad deal.\n\nJohn Laurenson Will the number of selfies go down when people have to pay to get into the village?",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Zaanse Schans is a small historic village in the Netherlands famous for its windmills. Although only about 100 people live there, millions of tourists visit each year, causing problems for the local community.\n\n**What happened** – Starting next spring, Zaanse Schans will charge visitors from outside the area a fee of €17.50 to enter. This is a new step taken by the local council to manage the huge number of tourists and to protect residents’ privacy. Visitors will pay online in advance and get access to the village museum and inside the windmills as part of the fee.\n\n**Impact** – This is a rare move for a village, but it helps reduce overcrowding and stops tourists from invading people’s homes and gardens. The money collected will be used to maintain the windmills and improve village facilities, such as adding new toilets. However, some local shop and restaurant owners worry the fee might reduce visitors and hurt their businesses.\n\n**What's next step** – The council hopes that fewer tourists will visit after the charge is introduced, making the village more manageable. They plan to use the income for repairs and better infrastructure. Meanwhile, local businesses will need to adapt to the new visitor numbers and find ways to keep attracting customers.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Zaanse Schans will charge an entry fee to control overcrowding, protect residents, and fund upkeep of its famous windmills.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Zaanse Schans est un petit village historique aux Pays-Bas, célèbre pour ses moulins à vent. Bien que seulement 100 personnes y vivent, des millions de touristes le visitent chaque année, ce qui cause des problèmes pour la communauté locale.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – À partir du printemps prochain, Zaanse Schans fera payer aux visiteurs venant de l'extérieur une entrée de 17,50 € pour accéder au village. Cette mesure rare vise à gérer le grand nombre de touristes et à protéger la vie privée des habitants. Les visiteurs devront réserver et payer en ligne et auront accès au musée et à l’intérieur des moulins.\n\n**Impact** – Cette initiative aide à réduire la surpopulation et empêche les touristes de pénétrer dans les jardins et maisons des habitants. L'argent récolté servira à entretenir les moulins et améliorer les infrastructures, comme l’ajout de toilettes. Cependant, certains commerçants craignent une baisse des visiteurs et des ventes.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le conseil espère que le nombre de visiteurs diminuera, rendant le village plus facile à gérer. Ils utiliseront les fonds pour la maintenance et les améliorations. Pendant ce temps, les commerces locaux devront s’adapter à la nouvelle situation.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Zaanse Schans fera payer une entrée pour contrôler la foule, protéger les habitants et financer l’entretien de ses célèbres moulins.\n",

Los visitantes deberán reservar y pagar en línea y podrán acceder al museo y al interior de los molinos.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta acción ayuda a reducir la sobrepoblación y evita que los turistas entren en los jardines y casas de los vecinos. El dinero recaudado se usará para mantener los molinos y mejorar las instalaciones, como construir nuevos baños. Sin embargo, algunos comerciantes temen que la entrada reduzca el número de visitantes y afecte sus negocios.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El ayuntamiento espera que disminuyan los turistas para facilitar la gestión del pueblo. Usarán los ingresos para el mantenimiento y mejoras. Mientras tanto, los comercios locales tendrán que adaptarse a la nueva situación.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Zaanse Schans cobrará una entrada para controlar la multitud, proteger a los residentes y financiar el cuidado de sus famosos molinos.\n",
