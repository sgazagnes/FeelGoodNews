      "content": "First leukaemia patient to receive pioneering treatment on NHS says it is 'very sci-fi'\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Fergus Walsh Medical editor Share Save\n\nBBC Oscar Murphy has now finished his CAR-T therapy and is hopeful for his future\n\nThe first leukaemia patient to receive a breakthrough treatment since it was made available on the NHS has said it was \"fantastic\" and \"very sci-fi\". Oscar Murphy, 28, who has an aggressive form of the blood cancer, was given the \"living drug\", called CAR-T therapy, at Manchester Royal Infirmary. BBC News was present on 2 January when Oscar received the first of two infusions of his own immune cells, which had been genetically modified to recognise and target his cancer. NHS England has agreed to fund the immunotherapy at several centres across the country. About 50 NHS patients a year are likely to benefit from it.\n\nOscar was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-cell ALL) in March 2025. He underwent chemotherapy and a donor stem cell transplant in July but in November was told that his cancer had returned. \"The leukaemia I've got is so fast-acting,\" the car salesman from Bury said. \"It needs an even quicker response to stop it. And we've now got an answer for that.\" In a clinical trial, 77% of patients went into remission after treatment, with half showing no signs of cancer after three and a half years. On average, the treatment gave patients 15.6 additional months of life. Oscar's haematologist, Dr Eleni Tholouli, said the CAR-T therapy was safer than existing treatments, with fewer side-effects and much more effective. \"Usually, this type of leukaemia is very aggressive and adult patients don't live beyond six to eight months. With this therapy, we are able to offer them years and potentially a cure. \"It's very significant and is revolutionising the way we tackle this cancer.\"\n\nFamily handout Oscar married Lauren in hospital last month because of the uncertainty surrounding his treatment\n\nCAR-T therapy has been available on the NHS for several years for certain types of leukaemia and lymphoma but has only now been extended to adults with B-cell ALL. Last month, Oscar had T-cells - a type of white blood cell - removed and sent to a lab in Stevenage. The cells were then reprogrammed using a harmless virus to introduce a genetic sequence that enables them to identify the cancer. New surface receptors can then recognise and are able to attach to cancer cells - like a lock and key - and mark them for destruction. They become \"chimeric antigen receptor T-cells\" - or CAR T-cells - and their numbers are greatly expanded in the lab to make millions of copies. Oscar's personalised treatment, or living drug, was cryopreserved and sent to Manchester Royal Infirmary. The tiny bag containing Oscar's personalised treatment held 100 million CAR T-cells in just three teaspoons of liquid, and it took only a few minutes to infuse into his bloodstream.\n\nOscar said he was surprised the treatment could pack such a powerful punch in such a small dose. \"It's very sci-fi, but if it means it gets rid of the cancer permanently and my own cells can do it it's just fantastic.\" Oscar had a second infusion of 300 million cells yesterday, marking the end of his CAR-T treatment. As this is a \"living drug\", the cancer-killing T-cells stay in the body for a long time and will continue to grow and work inside the patient after the final infusion. The CAR-T therapy is manufactured by Autolus, a spin-out company from University College London. During clinical trials, the patient's cells had to be sent to laboratories in the US. The list price of the treatment is £372,000 per infusion, but the NHS has a confidential discount. It will be available to patients over the age of 26 whose B-cell ALL has not responded to treatment or has returned at several centres in England, including Cambridge, Newcastle, Sheffield, Plymouth and London. Patients from Wales and Northern Ireland will need to travel to England for treatment. It has not yet been approved in Scotland. NHS England estimates that around 50 patients a year may benefit, but Tholouli told the BBC she believed it could be more, and predicted it would eventually be used as a first-line treatment instead of stem cell transplantation. Prof Peter Johnson, NHS National Clinical Director for Cancer, said it was a \"landmark moment\" for people with aggressive blood cancer. He added it was \"remarkable\" the treatment now delivered at NHS centres had been developed from scientific research within the UK. \"It will help more people like Oscar live longer and healthier lives.\"\n\nChris Williams had the treatment during its experimental phase and has been in remission for nearly three years",

      "title": "Scientists discover how the uterus knows when to push during childbirth",
      "summary": "Childbirth depends not just on hormones, but on the uterus’s ability to sense physical force. Scientists found that pressure and stretch sensors in uterine muscles and surrounding nerves work together to trigger coordinated contractions. When these sensors are disrupted, contractions weaken and delivery slows. The discovery helps explain stalled labor—and could one day lead to better ways to manage childbirth.",
      "content": "Successful childbirth depends on the uterus producing steady, well-organized contractions that move the baby safely through delivery. Hormones such as progesterone and oxytocin play a major role in controlling this process. For years, however, researchers have also suspected that physical forces involved in pregnancy and birth, including stretching and pressure, contribute in important ways.\n\nNew research from Scripps Research, published in Science, now shows how the uterus detects and responds to these physical forces at the molecular level. The findings shed light on why labor sometimes slows or begins too early and could guide future efforts to improve treatments for pregnancy and delivery complications.\n\nPressure and Stretch as Biological Signals\n\n\"As the fetus grows, the uterus expands dramatically, and those physical forces reach their peak during delivery,\" says senior author Ardem Patapoutian, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and the Presidential Endowed Chair in Neurobiology at Scripps Research. \"Our study shows that the body relies on special pressure sensors to interpret these cues and translate them into coordinated muscle activity.\"\n\nPatapoutian shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for identifying the cellular sensors that allow organisms to detect touch and pressure. These sensors are ion channels built from proteins known as PIEZO1 and PIEZO2, which enable cells to respond to mechanical force.\n\nTwo Sensors With Different Roles in Childbirth\n\nIn the new study, researchers found that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 perform separate but complementary tasks during labor. PIEZO1 operates primarily within the smooth muscle of the uterus, where it detects rising pressure as contractions strengthen. PIEZO2, in contrast, is located in sensory nerves in the cervix and vagina. It becomes activated as the baby stretches these tissues, triggering a neural reflex that boosts uterine contractions.\n\nTogether, these sensors convert stretch and pressure into electrical and chemical signals that help synchronize contractions. If one pathway is disrupted, the other can partially compensate, helping labor continue.\n\nWhat Happens When Force Sensors Are Removed\n\nTo test how essential these sensors are, the team used mouse models in which PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 were selectively removed from either uterine muscle or surrounding sensory nerves. Tiny pressure sensors measured contraction strength and timing during natural labor.\n\nMice lacking both PIEZO proteins showed weaker uterine pressure and delayed births, indicating that muscle-based sensing and nerve-based sensing normally work together. When both systems were lost, labor was significantly impaired.\n\nWiring the Uterus for Strong Contractions\n\nFurther investigation revealed that PIEZO activity helps regulate levels of connexin 43, a protein that forms gap junctions. These microscopic channels connect neighboring smooth muscle cells so they contract together rather than independently. When PIEZO signaling was reduced, connexin 43 levels dropped and contractions became less coordinated.\n\n\"Connexin 43 is the wiring that allows all the muscle cells to act together,\" says first author Yunxiao Zhang, a postdoctoral research associate in Patapoutian's lab. \"When that connection weakens, contractions lose strength.\"\n\nEvidence From Human Tissue\n\nSamples of human uterine tissue showed patterns of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 expression similar to those seen in mice. This suggests that a comparable force-sensing system likely operates in people. The findings may help explain labor problems marked by weak or irregular contractions that prolong delivery.\n\nThe results also align with clinical observations that fully blocking sensory nerves can lengthen labor.\n\n\"In clinical practice, epidurals are given in carefully controlled doses because blocking sensory nerves completely can make labor much longer,\" notes Zhang. \"Our data mirror that phenomenon; when we removed the sensory PIEZO2 pathway, contractions weakened, suggesting that some nerve feedback promotes labor.\"\n\nPotential Implications for Labor Care\n\nThe study opens the door to more targeted approaches to managing labor and pain. If researchers can develop safe ways to adjust PIEZO activity, it may become possible to either slow or strengthen contractions when needed. For those at risk of preterm labor, a PIEZO1 blocker, if developed, could work alongside current medications that relax uterine muscle by limiting calcium entry into cells. On the other hand, activating PIEZO channels might help restore contractions in stalled labor.\n\nAlthough these applications remain far off, the underlying biology is becoming clearer.\n\nHow Hormones and Force Work Together\n\nThe research team is now examining how mechanical sensing interacts with hormonal control during pregnancy. Earlier studies show that progesterone, the hormone that keeps the uterus relaxed, can suppress connexin 43 expression even when PIEZO channels are active. This helps prevent contractions from starting too soon. As progesterone levels fall near the end of pregnancy, PIEZO-driven calcium signals may help set labor in motion.\n\n\"PIEZO channels and hormonal cues are two sides of the same system,\" points out Zhang. \"Hormones set the stage, and force sensors help determine when and how strongly the uterus contracts.\"\n\nMapping the Nerve Pathways of Labor\n\nFuture studies will focus on the sensory nerve networks involved in childbirth, since not all nerves around the uterus contain PIEZO2. Some may respond to different signals and act as backup systems. Distinguishing nerves that promote contractions from those that transmit pain could eventually lead to more precise pain relief methods that do not slow labor.\n\nFor now, the findings highlight that the body's ability to sense physical force extends beyond touch and balance. It also plays a central role in one of biology's most critical processes.\n\n\"Childbirth is a process where coordination and timing are everything,\" says Patapoutian. \"We're now starting to understand how the uterus acts as both a muscle and a metronome to ensure that labor follows the body's own rhythm.\"\n\nIn addition to Patapoutian and Zhang, authors of the study \"PIEZO channels link mechanical forces to uterine contractions in parturition,\" include Sejal A.

      "summary": "Scientists at Tufts have found a way to turn common glucose into a rare sugar that tastes almost exactly like table sugar—but with far fewer downsides. Using engineered bacteria as microscopic factories, the team can now produce tagatose efficiently and cheaply, achieving yields far higher than current methods. Tagatose delivers nearly the same sweetness as sugar with significantly fewer calories, minimal impact on blood sugar, and even potential benefits for oral and gut health.",
      "content": "For more than a century, scientists and food companies have been looking for ways to replicate the taste of sugar without its health drawbacks. From early sweeteners like saccharin in the 19th century to modern alternatives such as stevia and monk fruit, the goal has remained the same. The challenge has been finding something that delivers sugar's familiar flavor while avoiding excess calories, tooth decay, and increased risks of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes.\n\nA new study published in Cell Reports Physical Science suggests that researchers may be closer to that goal. Scientists at Tufts University have developed a biosynthetic method to produce tagatose, a naturally occurring but extremely rare sugar. Tagatose closely mimics the taste of table sugar and could offer a way to enjoy sweetness with fewer negative health effects. Researchers say it may even provide added benefits.\n\nWhat Is Tagatose and Where It Comes From\n\nTagatose exists naturally, but only in very small quantities compared with common sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose. It appears in milk and other dairy products when lactose breaks down under heat or enzymatic activity, including during the production of yogurt, cheese, and kefir.\n\nTiny amounts of tagatose are also present in fruits like apples, pineapples, and oranges. However, it typically makes up less than 0.2% of the sugars found in these natural sources. Because of this scarcity, tagatose is usually produced through manufacturing rather than extracted directly from foods.\n\nEngineering Bacteria to Make Rare Sugar\n\n\"There are established processes to produce tagatose, but they are inefficient and expensive,\" said Nik Nair, associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at Tufts.\n\nTo address this problem, the research team developed a new production strategy using genetically engineered bacteria. \"We developed a way to produce tagatose by engineering the bacteria Escherichia coli to work as tiny factories, loaded with the right enzymes to process abundant amounts of glucose into tagatose. This is much more economically feasible than our previous approach, which used less abundant and expensive galactose to make tagatose.\"\n\nThe bacteria were modified to include a newly identified enzyme from slime mold called galactose-1-phosphate-selective phosphatase (Gal1P). This enzyme enables the bacteria to generate galactose directly from glucose. Another enzyme produced by the bacteria, known as arabinose isomerase, then converts the galactose into tagatose.\n\nUsing this method, the engineered bacteria can convert glucose into tagatose with yields as high as 95%. This represents a major improvement over traditional manufacturing techniques, which typically achieve yields ranging from 40 to 77%. The higher efficiency also makes the process significantly more cost-effective.\n\nSweetness, Safety, and Fewer Calories\n\nTagatose delivers about 92% of the sweetness of sucrose -- table sugar -- while containing roughly 60% fewer calories. It has been classified by the FDA as \"generally recognized as safe,\" meaning it can be used in consumer food products. This designation is shared by everyday ingredients such as salt, vinegar, and baking soda.\n\nOne reason tagatose may be beneficial for people with diabetes is how the body processes it. Only part of the sugar is absorbed in the small intestine, while much of it is fermented by gut bacteria in the colon. As a result, tagatose has a much smaller effect on blood glucose and insulin levels than conventional sugar. Clinical studies have shown only minimal increases in plasma glucose or insulin after consumption.\n\nTagatose may also support oral health. Unlike sucrose, which feeds bacteria that cause cavities, tagatose appears to limit the growth of some of those harmful microbes. Research also suggests it may have probiotic effects that promote healthier bacteria in both the mouth and the gut.\n\nA Sugar That Cooks Like Sugar\n\nBecause it is low in calories and poorly absorbed by the body, tagatose functions well as a \"bulk sweetener.\" This means it can replace sugar not only for sweetness but also for the physical properties sugar provides in cooking and baking. High intensity sweeteners cannot replicate this effect. Tagatose browns like table sugar when heated, and taste tests show it closely matches the flavor and mouthfeel of conventional sugar.\n\nWhy This Discovery Matters\n\n\"The key innovation in the biosynthesis of tagatose was in finding the slime mold Gal1P enzyme and splicing it into our production bacteria,\" said Nair. \"That allowed us to reverse a natural biological pathway that metabolizes galactose to glucose and instead generate galactose from glucose supplied as a feedstock. Tagatose and potentially other rare sugars can be synthesized from that point.\"\n\nThe researchers say this approach could open the door to producing other rare sugars more efficiently, potentially reshaping how sweeteners are made and used in the future.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn a discovery that’s generating cautious optimism in the scientific community, researchers in the United States have successfully reversed advanced Alzheimer’s disease in mice. Using a powerful compound called P7C3-A20, the scientists not only prevented the disease in genetically predisposed animals, but also restored memory and cognitive function in mice with existing Alzheimer’s.\n\nThe results, published in Cell Reports Medicine, come from a collaborative study by scientists at Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center in Ohio.\n\n“The key takeaway is a message of hope,” said Dr. Andrew A. Pieper, principal investigator of the study and a neuroscience professor at Case Western Reserve. “The effects of Alzheimer’s disease may not be inevitably permanent. The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”\n\nA promising breakthrough in Alzheimer’s research\n\nMore than seven million Americans currently live with Alzheimer’s, a degenerative disease that gradually erodes memory, personality, and independence. Most patients are over the age of 65, and despite decades of research, treatment options remain limited to slowing symptoms rather than reversing the disease.\n\nThat’s why this new study is creating a ripple of hope. Using mice genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer’s, researchers saw remarkable results after administering P7C3-A20, a compound known to support brain cell metabolism.\n\nThe study included two types of mice: one with amyloid plaque buildup and another with tau protein tangles, both of which are key hallmarks of Alzheimer’s. In each case, mice given the compound not only avoided the progression of the disease but, more importantly, those already exhibiting cognitive decline regained normal function.\n\n“Restoring the brain’s energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery,” Pieper explained. “Seeing this effect in two very different models, driven by separate genetic causes, strengthens the idea that recovery from advanced disease might be possible in people when the brain’s NAD+ balance is restored.”\n\nWhy NAD+ is at the center of the Alzheimer’s puzzle\n\nAt the heart of the research is a molecule called NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). NAD+ is a coenzyme critical to cell metabolism, and its levels naturally decline with age. That said, in Alzheimer’s patients, the drop is even more severe, impairing the brain’s ability to function, manage inflammation, and protect against cellular damage.\n\nP7C3-A20 works by increasing NAD+ levels, essentially restoring energy and function to brain cells. When NAD+ balance was reestablished in the mice, so too were their cognitive abilities.\n\nThis approach is different from other methods aimed at treating Alzheimer’s. Instead of targeting symptoms or plaques alone, the study focuses on the underlying metabolic dysfunction that makes the brain more vulnerable to the disease in the first place.\n\nSafer pathways to restoring brain health\n\nSupplements that claim to increase NAD+ are already widely available online, so boosting NAD+ is certainly not a new concept. Still, Pieper warns that using over-the-counter precursors may come with risks.\n\nSome NAD+ supplements can push levels so high that they could potentially trigger cancer, he cautioned. By contrast, P7C3-A20 offers a more balanced and regulated method of restoring NAD+ without those risks.\n\n“This compound offers an alternative pathway,” Pieper said, emphasizing its therapeutic potential.\n\nThe future of treatment\n\nAlthough the study is still in its preclinical stages, scientists believe it opens an important door. The next step, researchers say, is to move forward with human clinical trials, a process that could take several years but is already generating excitement in the broader medical community.\n\nNeuroscientists unaffiliated with the study are also encouraged. Professor Tara Spires-Jones of the University of Edinburgh recently told the BBC that we may be only five to ten years away from “truly life-changing” treatments for Alzheimer’s. She believes new detection tools, combined with targeted therapies, will one day “make your life normal” despite a diagnosis.\n\nThere’s also growing recognition that Alzheimer’s may stem from a mix of genetic, environmental, and inflammatory factors, meaning future treatments may include personalized combinations of therapies tailored to each patient’s unique risk profile.\n\nA word of caution about self-medicating\n\nFollowing the study’s publication, some individuals have begun searching for ways to access P7C3-A20 themselves. A quick search online reveals websites selling vials of the compound, raising concerns about self-medication.\n\nWhile the results in mice are promising, this compound is not yet approved for human use, and researchers urge the public to wait for proper clinical trials and safety testing.\n\nWhat this could mean for patients and families\n\nThis Alzheimer’s breakthrough offers a rare and much-needed note of optimism. By restoring NAD+ levels and addressing the brain’s underlying energy imbalance, researchers not only halted but reversed disease symptoms in mice.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the study still needs to be replicated and expanded into human trials, but it marks a significant step forward. For families affected by Alzheimer’s, this research sends a powerful and exciting message: healing the brain may one day be possible.\n\nSource study: Cell Reports Medicine— Pharmacologic reversal of advanced Alzheimer’s disease in mice and identification of potential therapeutic nodes in human brain\n\nDid this story stand out?
