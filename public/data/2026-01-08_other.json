      "summary": "Dogs began diversifying thousands of years earlier than previously believed, with clear differences in size and shape appearing over 11,000 years ago. A massive global analysis of ancient skulls shows that early dogs were already adapting to different roles in human societies. This challenges the idea that dog diversity is mainly a product of recent breeding. Instead, it points to a long process of coevolution between humans and their earliest canine companions.",
      "content": "New archaeological research is reshaping our understanding of when domestic dogs first developed the wide range of shapes and sizes seen today. The study shows that dogs began to vary in form far earlier than scientists once believed, with clear signs of diversity appearing at least 11,000 years ago.\n\nUsing advanced shape analysis on hundreds of ancient remains collected across tens of thousands of years, researchers were able to track how early dogs changed over time. Their findings pinpoint a deep prehistoric moment when dogs started to differ noticeably in both size and skull shape.\n\nDog Diversity Predates Modern Breeding by Millennia\n\nFor decades, many scientists assumed that most dog diversity resulted from recent selective breeding practices that emerged with Victorian Kennel Clubs. This new work challenges that idea. Instead, it reveals that dogs were already showing substantial physical variation thousands of years ago, not long after they split from wolves.\n\nThe results suggest that early dogs were adapting quickly, long before the appearance of modern breeds, driven by their close and growing relationship with human communities.\n\nA Global Study Spanning 50,000 Years\n\nPublished in Science and led by researchers at the University of Exeter and the French CNRS, the project is the most wide-ranging analysis of dog skulls ever conducted. The study began in 2014 and examined 643 canid skulls from both modern and archaeological sources, including recognized breeds, street dogs, and wolves. Together, these specimens span roughly 50,000 years, from the Pleistocene to the present.\n\nScientists from more than 40 institutions worked together to create detailed 3D models of each skull. They analyzed these models using geometric morphometrics, a method that allows precise comparisons of size and shape.\n\nEarly Dogs Took on Many Roles and Forms\n\nThe analysis revealed that by the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods, dogs already displayed a broad range of skull shapes and body sizes. This growing diversity likely reflected the many roles dogs played in early human societies, including hunting, herding, guarding, and companionship.\n\n\"These results highlight the deep history of our relationship with dogs,\" said co-lead author Dr. Carly Ameen of Exeter's Department of Archaeology and History. \"Diversity among dogs isn't just a product of Victorian breeders, but instead a legacy of thousands of years of coevolution with human societies.\"\n\nThe Earliest Known Domestic Dogs\n\nThe oldest confirmed domestic dog in the study came from the Russian Mesolithic site of Veretye (dating to ~11,000 years ago). Researchers also identified early domestic dogs in America (~8,500 years ago) and Asia (~7,500 years ago), based on skull shapes associated with domestication. After these early appearances, variation among dogs increased rapidly.\n\nDr. Allowen Evin, co-lead author from the CNRS based at the Institut of Evolutionary Science-Montpellier, France, explained: \"A reduction in skull size for dogs is first detectable between 9,700-8,700 years ago, while an increase in size variance appears from 7,700 years ago. Greater variability in skull shape begins to emerge from around 8,200 years ago onwards.\n\n\"Modern dogs exhibit more extreme morphologies, such as short-faced bulldogs and long-faced borzois, which are absent in early archaeological specimens. However, there is a large amount of diversity among dogs even as early as the Neolithic; it was double that of Pleistocene specimens and already half the range seen in dogs today.\"\n\nWhy the First Dogs Remain Hard to Find\n\nThe research also highlights how difficult it is to identify the earliest stages of dog domestication. None of the Late Pleistocene specimens examined, including some previously suggested as \"proto-dogs,\" showed skull features consistent with domestication. This suggests that the very beginning of the domestication process remains elusive in the archaeological record.\n\nProfessor Greger Larson, senior author of the study from the University of Oxford, said: \"The earliest phases of dog domestication are still hidden from view, and the first dogs continue to elude us. But what we can now show with confidence is that once dogs emerged, they diversified rapidly. Their early variation reflects both natural ecological pressures and the profound impact of living alongside humans.\"\n\nRethinking the Evolution of Humanity's Closest Companion\n\nBy demonstrating that dog diversity emerged thousands of years earlier than previously assumed, the study opens new paths for understanding how changes in human culture and environment shaped the evolution of dogs. These findings reinforce the idea that dogs and humans have been closely influencing each other's lives since the very beginning of domestication.\n\nThe research was supported by national and international funding agencies, including the Natural Environment Research Council (UK), the Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK), the European Research Council, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Fyssen Foundation.",

      "content": "Rare Iron Age war trumpet and boar standard found\n\n23 hours ago Share Save Katy Prickett Share Save\n\nBBC/Rare TV The discovery of a carnyx (above) and a boar's head flag standard in the same hoard has been described as \"a discovery of a lifetime\" by archaeologists\n\nArchaeologists have been stunned to discover two of the rarest Iron Age objects in the same excavation. The team from Pre-Construct Archaeology was working on a building site a few miles from Thetford, Norfolk, when they came across the hoard last year. At its heart was the most complete battle trumpet, or carnyx, ever found in Europe - and the first-ever boar's head flag standard to be found in Britain. Senior project officer Gary Trimble told BBC Two's Digging for Britain, carnyces \"are extraordinarily rare... a boar standard, that's even rarer\".\n\nNorfolk Museums Service The carnyx has \"a wonderful little eye, which is a remarkable survivor and you can't help but be impressed and charmed by it\", said conservator Jonathan Carr\n\n\"We have our fair share of hoards in Norfolk, but this is so, so different - it is really, really special,\" he added. Dig leader Peter Crawley said he had a gut feeling about the site before the excavation began. \"It felt like one of those special sites that you do get every so often,\" he said.\n\nBBC/Rare TV Musician Letty Stott plays a replica of a carnyx to Fraser Hunter, presenter Alice Roberts and Gary Trimble during filming for Digging for Britain\n\nA war trumpet was used by Celtic tribes across Europe to intimidate their enemies and to inspire and direct warriors during battle. They included the Iceni tribe of East Anglia, which was led by queen Boudica in her failed uprising against the Romans in AD60 to 61. Carnyces fascinated the Romans, who frequently depicted them as war trophies.\n\nNorfolk Museums Service Carr said he was aware of the risks as he painstakingly removed the brittle finds from their block of soil\n\nConservator Jonathan Carr said the Thetford find was made \"from extremely thin sheets of metal which have become extremely brittle after 2,000 years in the ground\". As well as being one of only three carnyces found in Britain, it was \"the most complete carnyx ever found, with the pipe, mouthpiece and bell all uniquely intact\", he added. Dr Fraser Hunter, Iron Age and Roman curator at National Museums Scotland, said: \"I've looked at carnyces from around Europe, and the full research and conservation of these incredibly fragile remains will reshape our view of sound and music in the Iron Age.\"\n\nNorfolk Museums Service The boar's head standard was also created from thin sheets of metal and is an even rarer find than the musical instrument\n\nThe boar's head standard was made from sheet bronze. It would have been held aloft in battle like a flag and used as a rallying point for troops. Hunter said: \"They were very fierce animals to face in the hunt, so the symbolism of the boar is a lot about the strength of it - a very appropriate adversary in battle.\" The hoard, which dates to about 50BC and AD50, included five shield bosses and an iron object of unknown origin. Following its discovery, it was carefully lifted out of the earth in a soil block and scanned to work out where the items were positioned, before conservation began.\n\nNorfolk Museums Service The hoard included shield bosses, while the boar's head can be seen on the right and the carnyx is behind\n\nThe find was reported to the coroner and an inquest will be held to determine if it is treasure. Its long-term future has yet to be decided. Historic England is working with Pre-Construct Archaeology, Norfolk Museums Service and the National Museum of Scotland to coordinate the finds' research and conservation.\n\nBBC/Rare TV Anatomist, author and broadcaster Prof Alice Roberts has presented Digging for Britain since it first began\n\nDr Tim Pestell, a senior curator of archaeology for Norfolk Museums Service, said: \"This find is a powerful reminder of Norfolk's Iron Age past which, through the story of Boudica and the Iceni people, still retains its capacity to fascinate the British public. \"The Norfolk Carnyx Hoard will provide archaeologists with an unparalleled opportunity to investigate a number of rare objects and ultimately, to tell the story of how these came to be buried in the county 2,000 years ago.\" Claudia Kenyatta CBE and Emma Squire CBE, co-CEOs of Historic England, said it was a \"remarkable discovery\". \"We look forward to uncovering and sharing the story of the Norfolk community that owned and used these items,\" the pair added. The story of the discovery will be featured on BBC Two's Digging for Britain on 14 January at 21:00 GMT, or on BBC iPlayer.",

But exactly when and where it lived remain two of the great questions of human evolution.\n\nThe new fossils may not be the last common ancestor of the three human species, says Jean-Jacques Hublin at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany, but they are certainly close to the point at which ancient human lineages diverged.\n\nHublin and his colleagues analysed several fossils found in a cave called Grotte à Hominidés on the outskirts of Casablanca, Morocco, including two adult jawbones, a child’s jawbone and several vertebrae. One of the adult jawbones was reported in a previous study in 1969, but the rest have been described for the first time.\n\nThe fossilised molars are similar to those of early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, but the jaw shape resembles older African humans, like Homo erectus.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nFortuitously for the scientists, the Moroccan hominins lived at around the same time as a shift in the Earth’s magnetic field, which is recorded in the geological layer in which the fossils were found, allowing them to be dated to around 773,000 years ago.\n\nHublin says the discoveries fill a “major gap” in the African hominin record between 1 million and 600,000 years ago. Paleogenetic studies indicate that this is when the ancestors of Neandertals and Denisovans branched off the lineage that led to H. sapiens. Neanderthals went on to dominate Europe for hundreds of thousands of years. Denisovans travelled as far as East Asia, and H. sapiens are thought to have continued to evolve in Africa.\n\nThe newly described fossils were near contemporaries of a Spanish population of hominins called Homo antecessor, which has previously been considered as a possible common ancestor between H. sapiens and Neanderthals.\n\nJean-Paul Raynal et Fatima Zohra Sihi-Alaoui work on the excavation that led to the discovery of the fossils in Morocco R. Gallotti, Programme Préhistoire de Casablanca\n\nBoth H. antecessor and the Moroccan hominins display a “comparable mosaic of primitive and derived traits”, says Hublin, meaning there may have been connections and genetic exchanges between the populations across the Strait of Gibraltar. However, there are also clear differences between the fossils from the two regions, with the Spanish fossils appearing more Neanderthal-like.\n\n“The last common ancestor of these lineages was likely present on both sides of the Mediterranean at that time and was already diverging,” says Hublin. “This supports a deep African ancestry for Homo sapiens and argues against Eurasian origin scenarios that have been proposed by some authors.”\n\nJulien Louys at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, says he is struck by the differences in physical characteristics among early Pleistocene hominins that are closely related to or ancestral to our own species.\n\n“The important point raised is that these differences appear to have arisen before Homo antecessor made it to Spain, implying this species was one of potentially several that arose across northern Africa, but then somehow crossed the straits,” Louys says.\n\nChris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London says a study on Chinese hominin fossils published last year, to which he contributed, suggested the last common ancestor of H. sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans could have lived more than 1 million years ago.\n\n“It was unclear on which continent that common ancestor lived,” says Stringer. “However, even if the last common ancestor lived outside of Africa, our analyses indicated that the later evolution of Homo sapiens still took place in Africa, so in that case there would have been an early migration into Africa to continue that evolution.”\n\nThe new Moroccan fossils may even represent an early sapiens ancestor in Africa, he says, but there aren’t enough pieces of the skeleton to assign it to a species.\n\nHe is keen to compare the new fossils with the ones he has already studied to determine where they might fit.",

Los dientes son parecidos a los de los primeros humanos modernos y neandertales, pero la forma de la mandíbula se parece a humanos africanos más antiguos como Homo erectus.\n\n**Impacto** – Estos fósiles llenan un gran vacío en el registro fósil de África entre 1 millón y 600,000 años. Podrían ser un ancestro cercano compartido por humanos modernos, neandertales y denisovanos justo antes de que sus grupos se separaran. Este hallazgo apoya la idea de que los humanos evolucionaron principalmente en África y muestra que pudo haber conexiones entre humanos antiguos de ambos lados del mar Mediterráneo.\n\n**Qué sigue** – Los científicos compararán estos fósiles con otros de Europa y Asia para entender mejor la evolución humana. También quieren encontrar más fósiles para confirmar si estos restos pertenecen a una nueva especie o a una forma temprana de humanos modernos.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Fósiles encontrados en Marruecos de hace 773,000 años ofrecen nuevas pistas sobre el ancestro común de humanos modernos y sus parientes cercanos, profundizando nuestro conocimiento sobre los orígenes humanos.",

      "content": "GCSE results will be available online this summer\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Vanessa Clarke Education reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nGCSE students across England will be able to view their exams results on their phones for the first time in August. An \"education record\" app, trialled with 95,000 pupils in Manchester and the West Midlands last summer, will initially download the results - and also allow Year 11 students to then store a digital record of those results for future use, such as when applying for jobs or further education. However students will still be encouraged to go into school on results day to receive \"advice or support\", headteachers say.\n\nOne incentive to do so is that while the traditional brown envelopes containing the much-anticipated grades will still be available to collect in person from 08:00 on results day, the new app will not get its update until 11:00. The app will also hold information for schools and colleges on whether students have special educational needs and disabilities, or are eligible for free school meals. The Department for Education estimates the rollout could save schools and colleges up to £30m a year in administrative costs because of the costs and time currently involved in sharing information that now every teenager will be able to show on request at subsequent stages in their education. \"No student should have to rifle through drawers looking for a crumpled certificate when they're preparing for a job interview,\" Skills Minister Baroness Jacqui Smith said. \"This app will give young people instant access to their results whenever they need them while freeing up teachers and college staff from unnecessary paperwork.\" Schools are being encouraged to sign up so pupils can download and set up the app before the summer results day.\n\nDepartment for Education Students can keep the digital record of their results for future use.",
