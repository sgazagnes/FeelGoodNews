      "title": "How one Seattle organization is turning food waste into plant food",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "Lea esta nota en español.\n\nFor Maria Perez, joining a project to reduce food waste in Washington wasn’t just a job. Her journey with the Duwamish Valley Sustainability Association (DVSA) began when she was 14 and enrolled in a youth program that sparked her interest in fighting climate change. Six years later, the association hired her to manage a program that turns waste from a Seattle neighborhood into a type of liquid plant food.\n\nThe innovative program in the South Park area was launched by the DVSA in 2021, in partnership with nonprofits including Food Lifeline, Sustainable Seattle, and Black Star Farmers, as well as the company Chomp — which builds the initiative’s small-scale biodigesters.\n\nPerez spent hours learning about how the sealed container uses bacteria to reduce emissions while growing food for the predominantly Latino neighborhood. She spoke with residents, teaching young people who stood where she once had. Her enthusiasm for the project was impossible to miss — she talked about it constantly, sharing details with everyone in her life. “It was just really exciting [to see] how everything came into a circular economy,” Perez said.\n\nSlightly smaller than a shipping container, the sealed bins function much like a cow’s four-chambered stomach — introducing microbes that every year can turn 25 tons of rotting food into 5,400 gallons of fertilizer. It also creates biogas, a renewable energy source that can be used for electricity or fuel.\n\n“We started to develop a new project [focused on] organic waste, because when we worked in the South Park area, we saw a lot of garbage on the street,” said Edwin Hernandez, the association’s executive director. In a series of community meetings, DVSA asked local residents and businesses how they wanted to tackle the neighborhood’s waste problem. The answer that emerged was a biodigester, whose added benefits included providing sustainable infrastructure and green jobs, Hernandez said.\n\nDVSA staff and colleagues – including Maria Perez, far left; Todd Schindler, center; and Edwin Alberto Hernandez Reto, to his right – cutting the ribbon at the biodigester opening celebration at Food Lifeline in Seattle, October 11, 2024. Adrian Tan\n\nThe idea got underway with support from an EPA grant, along with money from the City of Seattle. Faculty from the University of Washington helped shape the project’s feasibility study. The coalition later received support from the state, including being selected to participate in the state’s new sustainable innovation program, NextCycle Washington, along with seed funding from the Department of Commerce.\n\nThe value of the biodigester, according to Hernandez, is in how it can transform trash like eggshells and banana peels into a resource that can help grow food locally.\n\nMore than a third of the food supply in the U.S. becomes food waste, according to estimates from the United States Department of Agriculture. “There are other better ways of dealing with food waste than sending it to our landfill,” said Adrian Tan, policy and market development manager at King County Solid Waste Division, who supported the project. “Could the food waste in our garbage be prevented, donated, composted, or put to other beneficial uses?”\n\nWhile Seattle is in King County — the largest county in the state — the city has its own waste management system, Tan explained. It collects food waste and other organic waste through a compost service, which it sends to two commercial composters. However, food waste that is put in the garbage gets transported by rail to a landfill in Oregon. The emissions from moving across state lines are compounded by the fact that when food waste decomposes in landfills, it releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nEdwin Hernandez giving a live demonstration of how the biodigester works at the opening celebration on October 11, 2024. Allie Long / EarthLab\n\nBiodigesters, in comparison, keep waste local. Jan Allen, the CEO of Chomp, was inspired to start the biodigester company because he wanted to eliminate the need for diesel trucks and their associated pollution — a common way to transport garbage.\n\n“Chomp is based on the aspiration to eliminate trucking of food into the community, and eliminate trucking of waste out of the community,” said Allen. “So we’re really trying to make a circular economy out of food, food waste, energy, and growing fresh food locally.”\n\nAllen says working directly with local communities to address shared challenges sets his company apart from other technological fixes. Their biodigesters draw on biomimicry, designing with inspiration from nature. “We try to keep it as simple as possible, [with] minimal moving parts,” said Allen. “We actually have figured out a way to have the microbes compress the gas for us, so we’re doing innovative stuff to not have too much machinery.”\n\nAs a manager of the project, Perez gave local restaurants trainings about the biodigester, along with other city waste reduction programs so they could learn how to turn their trash into resources. Every Tuesday, Perez and the young volunteers would split up into groups. “We would weigh the compost of participants, and accumulate the data,” said Perez. When the biodigesters were done processing, Perez explained, “we would give the liquid soil amendment back out to the community.”\n\nDVSA also gave trainings to the neighborhood’s residents in Spanish, English, and Khmer, the official and national language of Cambodia. Hernandez says the main challenge facing the project now is distributing the liquid soil amendment, and “securing a free area where we can install more biodigesters,” increasing the amount of biogas that can be created. So far, over 30 residents and 5 restaurants have signed up to participate in the program. DVSA is eager to sign up more.\n\nAlthough Perez has recently stepped away from the project to focus on attending college, she’s encouraged by what has been accomplished, and takes pride in knowing it continues to benefit the community.\n\n“I feel happy that this happened, because there’s a lot of people that now know about this project, and how it’s affecting South Park,” she said. “It just brings everyone together.”\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Communities of Opportunity, a growing partnership that believes every community can be a healthy, thriving community. Communities of Opportunity is a unique community-private foundation-government partnership that invests in the power of communities in King County, Washington.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In Seattle's South Park neighborhood, food waste was piling up on streets and going to landfills far away. This caused pollution and wasted valuable resources. A group called the Duwamish Valley Sustainability Association (DVSA) wanted to find a better way to handle this problem.\n\n**What happened** – Since 2021, DVSA has run a program that uses biodigesters—special sealed containers that break down food waste using bacteria. These machines turn 25 tons of food scraps each year into 5,400 gallons of liquid fertilizer and produce biogas, a clean energy source. Maria Perez, who joined DVSA as a youth and now manages the program, helps local residents and restaurants learn how to use the system. The project is supported by several nonprofits, a company called Chomp that builds the biodigesters, and government grants.\n\n**Impact** – This program reduces harmful methane gas that comes from food waste rotting in landfills. Instead, it creates useful products that help grow food locally and produce renewable energy. It also creates green jobs and involves the community by offering trainings in multiple languages. The biodigester is small enough to keep waste processing local, cutting down pollution from trucks that normally carry garbage long distances.\n\n**What’s next step** – DVSA wants to expand the program by finding more places to install biodigesters and signing up more residents and restaurants. They also aim to improve distributing the liquid fertilizer back to the community so more people can benefit from it. Maria Perez, though now in college, remains proud of the project’s success and its positive effect on South Park.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A Seattle neighborhood is turning food waste into fertilizer and clean energy with biodigesters, improving the environment and supporting its community.\n",

      "title": "Doomed ants send a final scent to save their colony",
      "summary": "Ant pupae that are fatally sick don’t hide their condition; instead, they release a special scent that warns the rest of the colony. This signal prompts worker ants to open the pupae’s cocoons and disinfect them with formic acid, stopping the infection before it can spread. Although the treatment kills the sick pupa, it protects the colony and helps ensure its long-term survival. Researchers found that only pupae too sick to recover send this scent, showing just how finely tuned the colony’s early-warning system is.",
      "content": "Ant societies behave like tightly integrated \"superorganisms,\" where thousands of individuals work together in a way that resembles the coordinated activity of cells in a body. Researchers at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) have found that terminally ill ant brood release a distinctive odor, similar to the way infected body cells send out distress signals. This scent acts as an early alert that helps the colony quickly detect and eliminate infections before they spread. The findings were published in Nature Communications.\n\nIn many social animals, individuals often hide signs of illness to avoid being pushed aside by the group. Ant pupae take a very different route. When facing an infection they cannot survive, they produce a chemical alarm that warns their nestmates of the danger they represent.\n\nWorker Ants Respond to the Warning Signal\n\nAs soon as worker ants detect this signal, they move rapidly. They open the infected pupa's cocoon, create small cuts in its outer surface, and apply formic acid, a natural antimicrobial compound produced by the workers themselves. This treatment kills the pathogens growing inside the pupa but also results in the pupa's death.\n\n\"What appears to be self-sacrifice at first glance is, in fact, also beneficial to the signaler: it safeguards its nestmates, with whom it shares many genes. By warning the colony of their deadly infection, terminally ill ants help the colony remain healthy and produce daughter colonies, which indirectly pass on the signaler's genes to the next generation,\" explains Erika Dawson, first author of the study and former postdoc in the Social Immunity' research group headed by Sylvia Cremer at ISTA.\n\nThe research, conducted with chemical ecologist Thomas Schmitt from the University of Würzburg in Germany, documents this form of altruistic disease signaling in social insects for the first time. Without such a warning system, a dying ant could become highly infectious and threaten the entire colony. By signaling their condition early, the incurably ill make it possible for the colony to remove the threat before it escalates.\n\nWhy Ant Colonies Rely on Extreme Cooperation\n\nAt the scale of the colony, ants function as a \"superorganism,\" where different members take on roles essential for group survival. Queens focus on reproduction, while workers manage everything from feeding to nest maintenance and health care. This mirrors the division of labor in the human body, where reproductive cells generate offspring and other cells perform daily biological tasks.\n\nBoth organisms and superorganisms depend on the close cooperation of reproductive and non-reproductive components. In ants, this cooperation is so extensive that it includes behaviors that benefit the colony even at the cost of the individual, such as sacrificing fatally infected brood.\n\nWhy an Early-Warning Signal Is Needed\n\nA natural question is why ants have evolved such a sophisticated alarm system if sick individuals can simply remove themselves. Cremer explains, \"Adult ants that approach death leave the nest to die outside the colony. Similarly, workers that have been exposed to fungal spores practice social distancing.\" However, this option is unavailable to brood, which cannot move independently. Like infected cells in the body, they require outside help.\n\nDeveloping pupae and body cells face similar challenges and use similar strategies. Both release chemical cues that draw either immune cells or worker ants to them, allowing these helpers to remove potential infection sources. Immunologists refer to this cue as the \"find-me and eat-me signal.\"\n\n\"The signal must be both sensitive and specific,\" Cremer adds. \"It should help to identify all terminally-sick ant pupae but be precise enough to avoid triggering the unpacking of healthy pupae or those capable of overcoming the infection with their own immune system.\" This raises the question of how such precision is achieved.\n\nHow Infection Changes the Pupal Scent\n\nSchmitt, whose work focuses on chemical communication in social insects, notes that workers can target a single sick pupa among many. \"This means the scent cannot simply diffuse through the nest chamber but must be directly associated with the diseased pupa. Accordingly, the signal does not consist of volatile compounds but instead is made up of non-volatile compounds on the pupal body surface.\"\n\nTwo components of the ants' natural scent profile become stronger when a pupa is fatally infected. To test whether this odor shift alone triggers the disinfection response, researchers transferred the altered scent to healthy pupae and monitored the workers' behavior.\n\n\"We extracted the smell from the signaling pupae and applied it to healthy brood,\" Cremer says. The results showed that the scent alone was enough to make workers unpack the treated pupae, demonstrating that the altered odor of terminally infected brood functions in the same way as the \"find-me and eat-me\" signal seen in infected body cells.\n\nWhy Only Certain Pupae Send the Warning\n\nAccording to Dawson, not all brood send this alarm signal. \"Queen pupae, which have stronger immune defenses than worker pupae and can limit the infection on their own, were not observed to emit this warning signal to the colony,\" she explains. Worker pupae, however, lacked this ability and did signal for help.\n\nBy signaling only when an infection cannot be controlled, brood ensure that the colony responds only to genuine threats. This prevents unnecessary loss of individuals that are still capable of recovery. Cremer concludes, \"This precise coordination between the individual and colony level is what makes this altruistic disease signaling so effective.\"\n\nInformation on Animal Studies\n\nTo better understand fundamental biological processes, such as those in behavioral biology, immunology or genetics, research involving animals is essential. No other methods, including in silico approaches, can fully replace these studies. All animals used in the experiments are collected, reared, and handled according to strict legal regulations.",

      "content": "The BII represents the average remaining proportion of the abundance of indigenous faunal and floral populations in an area relative to an intact reference state. In this case, it means pre-colonial and pre-industrial conditions4. Calculation of the BII requires three sets of information: (1) a map of human impacts across the area (typically proxied by land use, which captures major land covers, uses and associated activities); (2) the richness of indigenous species that occur in the area; and (3) intactness scores—estimates of the remaining proportion of intact reference populations of these indigenous species under different conditions of human impact—on a scale from 0 (no remaining individuals) to 1 (same abundance as the reference) and, in rare cases, to 2 (two or more times the reference population)4,5. For species that thrive in human-modified landscapes, scores can be greater than 1 but not exceed 2 to avoid extremely large scores biasing aggregation exercises4,5. The intact reference is the population abundance that would have occurred in the area before alteration by modern industrial society (around 1700 ce)4. In most parts of sub-Saharan Africa, this corresponds to populations before the substantial alteration of the landscape triggered by colonial settlement, although we recognize that some declines would already have occurred by this point in time. Because information on species populations from this era is almost non-existent, standard protocol is to reference a remote protected or wilderness area with a natural disturbance regime (a hybrid–historical approach51) where necessary4.\n\nThe BII for a unit of land (pixel) is calculated by averaging, across the richness R of indigenous species that should occur in that pixel, the intactness score I sk of species s given the human impacts (that is, land use) in that pixel k, such that each species counts equally. That is,\n\n$${\\mathrm{BII}}_{\\mathrm{pixel}}=(1/R){\\Sigma }_{s}{I}_{{sk}}$$ (1)\n\nThe index can accommodate data scarcity. In the absence of intactness scores per species per land use, the BII can use intactness scores that represent groups of species that are expected to respond similarly to human impacts (functional response groups) and species richness information for the broader area (for example, ecoregion)4. In such cases, the BII for a pixel is determined as follows:\n\n$${\\mathrm{BII}}_{\\mathrm{pixel}}=(1/{\\Sigma }_{i}{R}_{i}){\\Sigma }_{i}{R}_{i}{I}_{{ik}}$$ (2)\n\nwhere I ik is the intactness score for functional response group i given the land use in that pixel k, weighted by the richness R i of functional response group i (number of species or proportion of total species) in the relevant area (commonly, the ecoregion).\n\nBII can be averaged across n pixels in an area of interest (for example, continent, biome, ecoregion or country) to provide a single BII score that accounts for the composition of both species and land uses:\n\n$$\\mathrm{BII}=(1/n){\\Sigma \\mathrm{BII}}_{\\mathrm{pixel}}$$ (3)\n\nBII scores can be calculated for all species or a subset (for example, vertebrates, amphibians, among others). Here we made use of equations (2) and (3) to accommodate data scarcity. BII estimates were converted to percentages by multiplying by 100.\n\nIntactness scores co-produced by experts\n\nDetermining intactness scores for indigenous species in sub-Saharan Africa based on field-collected data of population abundances across different land uses (including in comparable intact reference areas) is limited by a lack of appropriate data for most species20,52. Instead, we made use of a published dataset of intactness scores that were estimated as part of our Biodiversity Intactness Index for Africa project (https://bii4africa.org/) by way of a structured expert elicitation process that involved 200 experts in African flora and fauna5. The bii4africa dataset contains intactness scores (I ik in equation (2)) for species groups representing terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods: ±5,400 amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) and vascular plants (±45,000 forbs, trees and shrubs and graminoids), including all mainland Afrotropical ecoregions53 across 9 specific land uses of varied intensity (Supplementary Table 2). A detailed description of our elicitation process and resulting bii4africa dataset can be found in our previously published paper5, which recognizes the contributing experts as co-authors. Here we provide a summary (Extended Data Fig. 1).\n\nA broad definition of expertise was used to identify experts, which was centred on experience of how sub-Saharan species are affected by human land uses. Diverse types of people can have such experience (for example, researchers, field guides, park rangers, conservation practitioners and museum curators). An expert was identified to lead an elicitation for each broad taxonomic group. Lead experts then recruited additional experts that met our definition of expertise, focusing on diversity geographically, taxonomically and professionally to promote elicitation rigour and to mitigate biases29,54,55,56. Additional experts were identified by snowballing among experts where needed to achieve a target group size of about 20 and followed best-practice guidelines29. We particularly sought African experts to overcome persistent biases towards Global North experts in ecological literature57,58. Biases towards well-published experts, taxa and geographies were challenging to completely overcome. Of the 200 experts who participated, there were more with experience in Southern (55% of experts) and East (33%) than Central (27%) and West (26%) Africa, with expert numbers also varying among taxonomic groups (12–38). Just over half the participating experts had university affiliations. Most resided in the region (72%) and 59% were from the region. All experts had place-based knowledge from the region, which informed the creation of a quantitative dataset through an iterative and interactive expert elicitation process. The process was informed by a published, modified-Delphi ‘IDEA’ protocol29 (multiple rounds of individual, independent expert estimation interspersed with group discussion and review), which draws on advances in expert elicitation that have been shown to improve data consistency.\n\nFor each broad taxonomic group, participating experts were convened in an online meeting to introduce the aim of the project, the notion of BII and how it is calculated and to explain the task of estimating intactness scores. Experts were given the opportunity to ask questions and voice concerns. It was not practical to ask experts to provide intactness scores for every species exposed to every combination of human activities across sub-Saharan Africa. Rather, we made use of a functional grouping approach4, asking experts to estimate the intactness of different groups of species (i in equation (2); ‘Sp_Groups’ tab in the bii4africa dataset5) in nine land uses characteristic of the region (k in equation (2); Supplementary Table 2). This contextualized generalization22 assumes that a functional group of species responds in the same way to the same type of land use across its regional range4. The exceptions were the 102 species of large mammals, for which experts decided to provide estimates at species level (with i representing a species in these instances). The intactness scores of plant groups were estimated by experts in each of the eight major biomes in the region (forest, Caesalpinioid-miombo humid savanna, mixed-Acacia savanna, grassland, shrubland, thicket, desert and fynbos)59,60,61. Both the species functional response groups and biomes were proposed by lead experts and refined on the basis of feedback from participating experts during the introductory meetings. Experts were instructed to make their intactness estimates at a landscape scale (that is, one or several square kilometres), considering the integrated impact of all characteristics of that landscape on each group of species.\n\nParticipating experts were given 2 weeks after the introductory meeting to independently provide their best-guess intactness scores through a survey spreadsheet. Experts estimated on average 155 intactness scores. The survey prompted experts to provide comments relevant to each estimate (for example, assumptions or uncertainties) to mitigate the risk of overconfidence and to detect potential inconsistencies between experts (for example, caused by linguistic uncertainties related to the survey62). A discussion meeting was convened in which the aggregated (anonymized) results per functional group and land use were presented to participating experts, based on evidence that group discussion can improve elicitation rigour29,54,55. Project and expert leads reflected on key trends and sources of variability. Experts were encouraged to share their experiences when undertaking the survey and to reflect on the aggregated results. We emphasized that the purpose of the discussion was not to reach consensus but rather to reduce uncertainties and biases by interrogating sources of variability, improving the consistency with which experts interpreted the survey instructions and cross-examining reasoning, assumptions and evidence to promote learning29,54,55. Experts were given 1 week to independently revise any of their scores based on insights gained in the discussion. Several experts withdrew during the process, stating time limitations or insufficient expertise, with 200 participating to completion. Their final scores are presented in the published bii4africa dataset5.\n\nAn average of 10 (s.d. = 7) experts provided an intactness estimate for each combination of functional response group (or species for large mammals) and land use (and biome for plants)5. Here we used mean intactness scores (that is, the average estimate across independent experts for each combination) as the most common form of data aggregation in structured expert elicitation protocols to counter the biases of individual experts29,54. The variability in scores among our sample of experts (expressed as 95% confidence intervals) was used to reflect the degree of uncertainty around BII estimates, which arose, for example, from differences in the place-based knowledge of the experts, unknowns or disagreements around how some functional response groups are affected by land uses and variability in the number of experts contributing to each aggregated estimate.\n\nSpecies richness across ecoregions\n\nFor vertebrates, each species in the IUCN Red List with a sub-Saharan African range was allocated to a species functional response group in the bii4africa dataset5 by lead experts, with input from the participating experts where needed. This list was coupled with a list of species per ecoregion to determine the number of species (R in equation (2)) in each functional response group i in each ecoregion. Species lists per ecoregion were obtained by intersecting the Ecoregions2017 Resolve map53 with species range maps available through the IUCN Red List63 and Birdlife International64, including historical ranges and extinct species, as the BII is relative to pre-colonial and pre-industrial conditions.\n\nGiven the large number of vascular plant species, the bii4africa dataset5 instead lists the proportion of plant species per biome that occur in each functional response group in the broad groups of forbs, trees and shrubs, and graminoids. Proportional richness across the three broad plant groups in each biome was estimated based on the RAINBIO65,66 dataset of tropical African vascular plant species distributions. Species in RAINBIO were allocated into the three broad bii4africa plant groups as follows: graminoids, all species in the families Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Juncaceae and Restionaceae; trees and shrubs, all remaining species with the growth form tree, shrub, liana or epiphyte; and forbs, all remaining species with the growth form herb, shrublet or vine. The geolocations of each RAINBIO species entry were overlaid onto the Ecoregions2017 Resolve map53 to determine the proportion of species in each broad plant group in each ecoregion and associated biome. The proportion of total plant species in each functional response group in each biome could then be determined and multiplied by total vascular plant species richness estimates per ecoregion67 to estimate plant species richness R i per functional response group i in each ecoregion.\n\nMapping land uses and intensities\n\nThe bii4africa dataset5 contains intactness scores for nine specific land uses to capture the major land cover types, uses and associated activities relevant to sub-Saharan Africa (Supplementary Table 2). These include the following types: (1a) mixed settlements; (1b) dense urban; (2) timber plantations; (3a/4a) non-intensive smallholder croplands; (3b) tree croplands; (4b) intensive large-scale croplands; (5) strictly protected areas; (6a) near-natural lands; and (6b) intensive rangelands. These land uses cover six broad classes, and high-intensity and low-intensity options for those classes that can vary notably in their intensity in the region (Extended Data Fig. 8). To map BII, we needed a land-use map that reflected these six broad land use classes and the spectrum of intensities that occur in four of these classes (Fig. 3a).\n\nWe used an established decision-tree algorithm68,69 built on (area) standardized thresholds of human population density and/or land cover to allocate each pixel in sub-Saharan Africa into one of six broad land-use classes to reflect the differences between the land uses described by experts (Extended Data Fig. 8). Settlement pixels (1) were allocated first, followed by timber plantations (2), tree croplands (3) and croplands (4), and thereafter protected pixels (5)68,69. All remaining pixels were then allocated to the unprotected untransformed class (6).\n\nIn four out of the six broad land-use classes, we then scored each pixel based on its intensity, using a protocol comparable with other well-established human intensity indices70. Proxies of intensity relevant to each class were selected to reflect the land-use descriptions for which experts estimated intactness scores (Extended Data Fig. 8). Each variable was standardized using minmax scaling, such that the pixel in a land use class with the lowest and highest value scored 0 and 1, respectively. An average of the relevant standardized variables in a land-use class was computed and then rescaled using minmax scaling. This value represented the relative intensity of each pixel in a land-use class (that is, the pixel scoring 0 versus 1 had the respective lowest versus highest mean intensity score in that class). When scaling variables that did not have a natural upper bound and were therefore susceptible to high outlier scores (for example, population density, livestock density or nitrogen input; Extended Data Table 2), the 90th percentile value was used as the maximum in the minmax scaling.\n\nBefore scaling livestock (cattle, goat or sheep) density as a proxy for intensity (Extended Data Fig. 8), we accounted for the fact that some areas can support higher grazing pressure. A unimodal relationship has been shown between potential African mammal herbivore biomass and mean annual rainfall (MAR), peaking at about 1,700 kg km–2 and around 700 mm MAR71. Moreover, potential African mammal herbivore biomass is higher in areas with higher nutrient soils72. Hence, we grouped pixels into comparable sets based on their MAR (in 400 mm bins) and soil nutrients (high, medium or low). We then minmax-scaled livestock density in each of these sets to ensure intensity was quantified across comparable areas.\n\nOne of the nine land use classes for which experts estimated intactness scores was a well-managed, strictly protected area (Supplementary Table 2). We limited our allocation of this land use to pixels occurring in protected areas with IUCN management categories I–III, as these have strict restrictions on human activities73. Four countries in sub-Saharan Africa do not make use of IUCN management categories, with strictly protected areas identified case by case (Supplementary Methods 1). Protected pixels were assigned after settlements and cultivated lands (Extended Data Fig. 8), which meant that any transformed lands in protected areas (that is, ineffective protected areas) were not allocated to the protected land use. We were unable to exclude strictly protected lands that are untransformed but subject to unsustainable resource harvesting—a limitation that means we may overestimate BII in some protected areas. By contrast, BII may be underestimated in lands that are strictly protected in practice but not on paper. The protected area allocation and therefore BII map can be updated should management effectiveness data become available for all protected areas.\n\nWe mapped land uses in Google Earth Engine at a resolution of 1 × 1 km and 8 × 8 km to reflect the landscape scale at which experts estimated intactness scores. The finer resolution may be useful to some applications but is computationally demanding to work with (>20 million pixels). The coarser resolution is likely to be more appropriate for certain species groups, such as large mammals and wide-ranging birds, which are unlikely to survive in 1-km2 patches of habitat. All land-use variables were obtained from pre-existing map products that spanned the full region to ensure consistency of inputs (Extended Data Table 2). When a map pixel covered more than one unit of a variable layer, overlapping variable values were either summed (in the case of land cover) or averaged, weighted relative to their degree of overlap (remaining variables). Missing values were imputed using the nearest provided value.\n\nCalculating and mapping BII\n\nBII scores for each pixel in the land-use map were estimated using equation (2) based on the average (across experts) intactness scores I ik for functional response groups i in land use class k (adjusted for intensity in four of the classes (see next paragraph)) and the ecoregion (which influences species richness R per functional response group i). Fifteen ecoregions were classified as mosaics categorized by two biomes (for example, the Angolan montane forest–grassland mosaic ecoregion is a mosaic of the forest and grassland biomes)5, with plant intactness scores for the two biomes averaged for these ecoregions. A BII score was determined for the following categories: (1) terrestrial vertebrates and plants; (2) vertebrates; (3) plants; (4) each of the four vertebrate classes (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) and three broad plant groups (forbs, trees and shrubs, graminoids); and (5) each of 146 functional response groups (with the large mammal species being categorized into the 12 functional response groups proposed in the bii4africa dataset5). To reflect uncertainty, we similarly estimated ‘lower limit’ and ‘upper limit’ BII scores for each pixel based on the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals around average intactness scores I ik . Lower-limit-BII and upper-limit-BII scores were determined for the following categories: (1) terrestrial vertebrates and plants; (2) vertebrates; and (3) plants.\n\nTo calculate BII (and lower-limit-BII and upper-limit-BII) scores in pixels with a land-use intensity continuum (Extended Data Fig. 8), the maximum (low intensity) and minimum (high intensity) intactness scores I ik were averaged and weighted according to the intensity of that pixel. For example, for settlement land-use pixels, those with an intensity of zero were allocated the ‘1a. Mixed settlements’ intactness scores, whereas those with an intensity of one were allocated the ‘1b. Dense urban’ scores (Supplementary Table 2). A pixel with an intensity of 0.5 received an average of the minimum and maximum scores. BII maps were produced in R.\n\nAnalyses and validation\n\nWe calculated the BII for sub-Saharan Africa by averaging BII scores across all pixels in the 1 × 1 km and 8 × 8 km maps. Given the high degree of correspondence (75.53% and 75.54%, respectively), further analyses were performed using the 8 × 8 km maps. We quantified the BII per country, ecoregion, biome and land use by averaging scores across all relevant pixels. We quantified the uncertainty around these BII values by averaging upper-limit-BII scores and lower-limit-BII scores across all relevant pixels. The percentage of pixels in each broad land-use class and the average BII of those pixels were used to determine the proportional contribution of each land use to the total BII that had been lost and that remained. We similarly assessed the contribution of ‘medium–high intensity’ versus ‘low intensity’ land uses to lost and remaining BII in each biome (pixels with intensity scores ≥0.25 and <0.25, respectively).\n\nWe followed a previously described method15 to assess the robustness of the BII map by comparing it to the human footprint index74 (HFI)—a composite map of anthropogenic pressure on natural ecosystems—and the biomass modification index75 (BMI)—a mapped synthesis of estimates of current vegetation biomass relative to that in the same location without human disturbance. We also related BII to the biodiversity habitat index76 (BHI)—the effective proportion of habitat remaining in a pixel, adjusting for the effects of the condition and functional connectivity of habitat. We would not expect these indicators to perfectly correlate with BII, as the BII accounts for varied responses of different species populations to human pressures and accounts for important regional contextual factors that may be overlooked in the other global indicators, such as smallholder versus large-scale croplands and rangelands versus planted pastures. However, we would expect areas with a higher BII to generally have a lower HFI, lower BMI and higher BHI, and vice versa15. To assess these relationships, we calculated the Spearman’s rank correlation of the average BII score and the average HFI, BMI and BHI scores across ecoregions. Using the previously described method15, we categorized each ecoregion as a biodiversity hotspot if the area of the ecoregion overlapped by ≥50% with a biodiversity hotspot (a priority area of exceptional endemism that has lost ≥70% of its primary vegetation)32,77. Hotspot ecoregions should typically have lower BII scores than other ecoregions, and we tested this by comparing the average BII scores of hotspots and other ecoregions using a two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test.\n\nAs an additional validity check, species-level BII estimates were compared to the risk of extinction of each species (according to the IUCN Red List63), with the expectation that a valid BII assessment should generally predict lower BII for more threatened species. We quantified the average BII of each vertebrate species (according to its functional response group or at species-level for large mammals) across its regional range. We then ran a generalized linear mixed-effects model (equation (4)), with a Gaussian distribution given data normality, to assess whether the IUCN threat category (‘IUCN category’) of a species (that is, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, near threatened or least concern) was a significant predictor of its average BII across its range (‘intactness index’). We included 4,887 sub-Saharan African vertebrate species with a threat category (we excluded 479 data-deficient species and 3 extinct species). We included IUCN threat category as a fixed effect and the range size of the species (‘range size scaled’) to isolate the effect of IUCN threat category on intactness, independently of the influence of range size (with range size being a consideration in the IUCN Red Listing process). The model also accounted for variation in intactness across taxonomic classes (‘Class’) and their nested functional response groups (‘RG’). These nested random effects capture baseline differences in intactness due to taxonomic and functional groupings, which ensures that the fixed effects are not biased by class-level or RG-specific variability.\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{Intactness}\\,\\mathrm{index} \\sim \\mathrm{IUCN}\\,\\mathrm{category}+\\mathrm{range}\\,\\mathrm{size}\\,\\mathrm{scaled}\\\\ \\,\\,\\,\\,+\\,(1|\\mathrm{Class}/\\mathrm{RG})\\end{array}$$ (4)\n\nThis model was run using the lme4 package in R. We checked that the response variable and model residuals were normally distributed and that the two fixed effects were not competing for variance in the global model (variance inflation factor close to 1). Range size was scaled and centred to avoid overdispersion and leverage. We ran an analysis of variance to test whether the fixed effects were significant predictors of intactness and post hoc Tukey tests to check for significance between IUCN categories (corrected for multiple pairwise comparisons).\n\nFinally, we compared the results of our BII assessment with those of two previous assessments. First, the original BII assessment that was published for southern Africa in 2005 based on a simplified expert elicitation4 and second, a globally modelled assessment that was published in 2016 (ref. 13).\n\nCaveats\n\nPeople are susceptible to a range of cognitive biases that can erode the quality of expert-elicited data (for example, based on information availability, overconfidence, linguistic uncertainty or groupthink)56,62,78,79. It can also be challenging to identify who is an expert54. We sought to mitigate such challenges by selecting a diverse group of experts, based on experience rather than status29,54,55,80, and taking them through a structured, iterative elicitation using an evidence-based protocol for improving rigour29. Our data-aggregation approach reduces the effect of expert biases29, assuming such biases are independent rather than systematic (for example, no groupthink81,82). However, expertise was overrepresented for certain geographies (for example, southern Africa), nationalities (for example, South Africa), taxonomic groups (for example, large mammals) and professions (for example, researchers)5, which may have resulted in unknown systematic biases in aggregated expert scores. Limitations to diverse expert participation probably include digital inequities, lack of incentive for non-researchers to participate in research and language barriers (particularly in Francophone countries). Furthermore, although overconfidence can be mitigated by asking experts to provide an upper and lower plausible estimate together with a best guess29, we found this to be cumbersome and confusing in a pilot with lead experts, given the high number of estimates. Instead, we mitigated against overconfidence by nudging experts to consider uncertainties and assumptions underlying their estimates, and encouraging critical evaluation during the discussion meeting29,54,55. Given the uncertainties inherent in expert elicitation, applications of this BII assessment should take note of the confidence intervals around mean estimates, which reflect known uncertainty among experts, while keeping in mind potential unknown uncertainties such as possible systematic bias in our expert group that are not reflected in these confidence intervals and that may have had a directional effect on our results.\n\nOur approach of contextualized generalization—integrating place-based knowledge into a broad-scale regional product that speaks to national and international decision-making needs—required several epistemological and methodological compromises. Epistemologically, the use of a pre-defined, relative (to a reference state) and bounded notion of biodiversity intactness is influenced by Western ways of thinking about science and ecology24 and reflects decisions made by the analysts as opposed to the experts83. We countered Western dominance by bringing more African expertise into ecology and adding insight around important aspects of regional context that are often ignored while using concepts and metrics that are embedded in international agreements such as the GBF, which countries are required to report to.\n\nMethodologically, to limit the number of estimates that each expert was asked to provide, we assessed BII at the level of functional response groups and land-use categories. We therefore compromised on potentially important variability among species in a functional group or land-use configurations in a category, which may influence BII. Furthermore, our analyses relied on published land-use and species-distribution datasets that may contain classification or coverage limitations. Notably, some land-use activities (for example, harvesting) are harder to map than those that can be seen from space (for example, crop cover), which limited our ability to account for these activities to mapped proxies such as population density and human infrastructure14,74. This limitation means we probably overestimate BII where human activities such as harvesting are notably more intensive in a given land use than predicted on average by our experts or mapped intensity proxies, and the converse in places that have notably lower-than-expected exploitation of wildlife due to, for example, taboos against bushmeat. Furthermore, the intensity of rangeland use is particularly challenging to map, and we advanced standard approaches by controlling for soil and rainfall in our translation of livestock density into a measure of land-use intensity in attempt to better account for local context. The accuracy of BII mapping based on our published expert estimates5 can probably be substantially improved over time with advances in land-use mapping.\n\nDespite these limitations to our approach, the resulting BII corroborated other assessments of human pressure. However, we note that these other assessments cannot be considered entirely independent given that they all rely on land-cover data and its associated limitations. Trends in the BII estimates for individual vertebrate species across their particular ranges were also robust when compared with their IUCN threat status. This comparison demonstrates that despite uncertainties at each step, our approach of functionally grouping species, asking diverse experts to estimate how those groups would be affected by characteristic land uses and mapping those estimates based on land uses and species ranges across the region led to intactness predictions that correspond as expected with an independent (although also expert-informed) assessment of the threat categories of individual species.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

      "summary": "The new rules will make the EU food system more secure and sustainable, with climate- and pest-resistant plants that give higher yields and require fewer fertilisers and pesticides.Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Source : © European Union, 2025 - EP",
      "content": "On Wednesday night, Parliament and Council negotiators reached a provisional political agreement on the Commission proposal on new genomic techniques (NGTs) – techniques that alter the genetic material of an organism.\n\nThe co-legislators agreed to exempt NGT1 plants, i.e. plants that could also occur naturally or through conventional breeding, from most of the precautionary requirements of EU legislation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), whereas NGT2 plants (all other NGT plants) will still be subject to these rules. The rules will apply to both plants originating in the EU and imported plants.\n\nCriteria for NGT1 and NGT2 plants\n\nThe co-legislators agreed on criteria to determine what constitutes an NGT1 plant and, at Parliament’s request, on an exclusionary list of intended traits, including known insecticidal effects and tolerance to herbicides, that are not allowed in NGT1 plants. To steer the use of NGTs towards the development of plants with sustainability features (e.g. climate and pest resistance), the co-legislators tasked the Commission and member states with monitoring the sustainability impacts of NGT plants, including with data obtained from official controls.\n\nIntellectual property rights and patents\n\nThe informal deal allows patents for NGTs, except for those traits or sequences occurring in nature or produced by biological means, while MEPs managed to insert safeguards to prevent market concentration, and to ensure affordability and fair access for farmers, so they retain the right to save and replant seeds.\n\nTo facilitate breeders’ access to NGTs and to enhance the legal certainty and transparency of information relating to patents, the Commission will work with stakeholders to draw up an EU code of conduct on patents no later than 18 months after entry into force of this Regulation.\n\nAn important aim of the code of conduct will be to include the modalities for licensing of patents under fair and reasonable conditions and the amicable settlement of patent disputes involving breeders and farmers in case of unintentional minor presence of patented material in their fields.\n\nIf a Commission impact assessment reveals significant barriers to access patented NGTs, it will have to take suitable action, including further legislative measures to set-up mandatory conditions, if appropriate.\n\nTraceability, labelling and opt-out for member states\n\nThe co-legislators agreed that plant varieties containing or derived from a NGT1 plant must be clearly indicated in all official databases and that all seed bags must be labelled NGT1, to allow farmers to make an informed choice. Full traceability and labelling will remain obligatory for NGT2s and EU countries may restrict or prohibit the cultivation of NGT2s after they have been authorised for cultivation in the EU in line with current rules on GMOs.\n\nOrganic plants\n\nNo NGTs will be allowed in organic production but the technically unavoidable presence of NGT1 plants would not constitute non-compliance. The Commission will assess whether this regulation creates any administrative, economic, or practical burdens for organic operators, including relating to their own perception and that of consumers.\n\nQuote\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, rapporteur Jessica Polfjärd (EPP, SE) said: “This is a historic day. The EU is taking its first step towards giving farmers access to new, Nobel Prize-winning technology. Technology that will allow them to grow crops that can withstand climate change and deliver higher yields on less land. This is crucial for strengthening our food security. Today's agreement is a breakthrough that boosts not only our farmers’ competitiveness, but also Europe's position in research and innovation.”\n\nNext steps\n\nThe vote on the informal agreement must now be endorsed by both Parliament and Council in second reading. It will then enter into force 20 days after it has been published in the EU Official Journal, and will apply two years later.\n\nBackground\n\nThe objective of the new rules is to make the food system more sustainable and resilient by developing and giving access to improved plant varieties that are climate- and pest-resistant, give higher yields, or require fewer fertilisers and pesticides. Several NGT products are already available on the market outside the EU, e.g. corn, wheat, and rice varieties that need less water, and bananas and mushrooms that do not go brown.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union wants to make farming more sustainable and secure by using new genomic techniques (NGTs). These methods change the genes of plants to help them grow better, resist pests, and survive climate challenges. Until now, strict rules treated all gene-edited plants like genetically modified organisms (GMOs), making it hard to use these new tools.\n\n**What happened** – On Wednesday night, EU lawmakers from Parliament and the Council reached an agreement on new rules for NGTs. Plants that could also appear naturally or be made by traditional breeding (called NGT1 plants) will face fewer restrictions, while other gene-edited plants (NGT2) will still follow strict GMO rules. These rules cover both plants grown in the EU and those imported. The agreement also includes clear labeling for seeds and plants, rules to protect farmers’ rights to save seeds, and limits on certain traits like herbicide tolerance in NGT1 plants.\n\n**Impact** – This deal makes it easier for farmers to use plants that are stronger against climate change and pests, while needing less fertilizer and pesticides. It balances innovation with safety by keeping stricter rules on some gene-edited plants. The agreement also protects farmers from high costs by limiting patent control and ensuring fair access to new plant varieties. This is the first time the EU has created specific rules for these new gene techniques, helping farmers grow more food sustainably and supporting Europe’s role in plant research.\n\n**What’s next step** – The agreement still needs formal approval by both Parliament and the Council. After that, the new rules will be published and take effect two years later. Meanwhile, the European Commission will work on a code of conduct for patents to keep the system fair and transparent. Officials will also monitor how these new plants affect sustainability and organic farming.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU has taken a major step to support climate-friendly farming by approving new rules that allow safer, gene-edited plants to help farmers grow more food with fewer chemicals.\n",
      "personality_title_fr": "L'UE adopte de nouvelles règles pour encourager une agriculture respectueuse du climat grâce aux techniques génomiques",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L'Union européenne souhaite rendre l'agriculture plus durable et sécurisée en utilisant de nouvelles techniques génomiques (NTG). Ces méthodes modifient les gènes des plantes pour les aider à mieux pousser, résister aux parasites et faire face aux changements climatiques. Jusqu'à présent, toutes les plantes génétiquement modifiées étaient soumises à des règles strictes, rendant difficile l'utilisation de ces nouvelles techniques.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Mercredi soir, les législateurs de l'UE, Parlement et Conseil, ont trouvé un accord sur de nouvelles règles pour les NTG. Les plantes pouvant aussi apparaître naturellement ou être obtenues par sélection traditionnelle (appelées NTG1) auront moins de restrictions, tandis que les autres plantes modifiées (NTG2) resteront soumises aux règles strictes des OGM. Ces règles concernent aussi bien les plantes cultivées dans l'UE que celles importées. L'accord prévoit aussi un étiquetage clair des semences et plantes, protège le droit des agriculteurs à conserver leurs graines, et limite certains traits comme la tolérance aux herbicides pour les NTG1.\n\n**Impact** – Cet accord facilite l'utilisation par les agriculteurs de plantes plus résistantes au climat et aux parasites, tout en réduisant le besoin d'engrais et de pesticides. Il équilibre innovation et sécurité en maintenant des règles strictes pour certains plantes modifiées. L'accord protège aussi les agriculteurs des coûts élevés grâce à des limites sur les brevets et assure un accès équitable aux nouvelles variétés. C'est la première fois que l'UE crée des règles spécifiques pour ces nouvelles techniques génomiques, aidant ainsi les agriculteurs à produire plus durablement et renforçant la position européenne dans la recherche végétale.\n\n**Étape suivante** – L'accord doit encore être officiellement approuvé par le Parlement et le Conseil. Ensuite, les règles seront publiées et entreront en vigueur deux ans plus tard. Par ailleurs, la Commission européenne élaborera un code de conduite sur les brevets pour garantir un système juste et transparent. Les autorités surveilleront aussi les impacts de ces nouvelles plantes sur la durabilité et l'agriculture biologique.\n\n**Phrase clé** – L'UE franchit une étape importante pour soutenir une agriculture respectueuse du climat en adoptant des règles permettant l'utilisation de plantes génétiquement modifiées plus sûres pour aider les agriculteurs à produire plus avec moins de produits chimiques.\n",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – La Unión Europea quiere hacer la agricultura más sostenible y segura usando nuevas técnicas genómicas (NTG). Estos métodos cambian los genes de las plantas para que crezcan mejor, resistan plagas y soporten el cambio climático. Hasta ahora, todas las plantas modificadas genéticamente tenían reglas estrictas, lo que dificultaba usar estas nuevas técnicas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El miércoles por la noche, los legisladores de la UE, el Parlamento y el Consejo, llegaron a un acuerdo sobre nuevas reglas para las NTG. Las plantas que también podrían aparecer de forma natural o mediante reproducción tradicional (llamadas NTG1) tendrán menos restricciones, mientras que otras plantas modificadas (NTG2) seguirán con las reglas estrictas para organismos genéticamente modificados (OGM). Estas reglas cubren plantas cultivadas en la UE y las importadas. El acuerdo también incluye etiquetado claro para semillas y plantas, protege el derecho de los agricultores a guardar semillas y limita ciertos rasgos como la tolerancia a herbicidas en plantas NTG1.\n\n**Impacto** – Este acuerdo facilita que los agricultores usen plantas más resistentes al clima y a las plagas, reduciendo la necesidad de fertilizantes y pesticidas. Equilibra la innovación con la seguridad manteniendo reglas estrictas para algunas plantas modificadas. También protege a los agricultores de altos costos limitando el control de patentes y asegurando acceso justo a nuevas variedades. Es la primera vez que la UE crea reglas específicas para estas nuevas técnicas genómicas, ayudando a los agricultores a producir más alimentos de forma sostenible y fortaleciendo la posición europea en investigación vegetal.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El acuerdo debe ser aprobado formalmente por el Parlamento y el Consejo. Después, las reglas se publicarán y entrarán en vigor dos años más tarde. Mientras tanto, la Comisión Europea trabajará en un código de conducta para patentes que garantice un sistema justo y transparente. También se monitorearán los efectos de estas nuevas plantas en la sostenibilidad y la agricultura orgánica.\n\n**Frase clave** – La UE da un paso importante para apoyar una agricultura amigable con el clima al aprobar reglas que permiten plantas modificadas genéticamente más seguras para ayudar a los agricultores a producir más con menos químicos.\n",
