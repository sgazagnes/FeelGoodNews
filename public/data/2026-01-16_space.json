      "title": "New research challenges the cold dark matter assumption",
      "summary": "Dark matter, one of the Universe’s greatest mysteries, may have been born blazing hot instead of cold and sluggish as scientists long believed. New research shows that dark matter particles could have been moving near the speed of light shortly after the Big Bang, only to cool down later and still help form galaxies. By focusing on a chaotic early era known as post-inflationary reheating, researchers reveal that “red-hot” dark matter could survive long enough to become the calm, structure-building force we see today.",
      "content": "Scientists from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities and Université Paris-Saclay are calling into question a long-standing idea about dark matter. Their latest findings suggest that this elusive substance may have been \"incredibly hot\"-moving at nearly the speed of light-when it first formed, rather than cold and slow as researchers have long assumed.\n\nThe work was published in Physical Review Letters, the flagship journal of the American Physical Society. By reexamining how dark matter may have emerged in the early Universe, the study expands the range of possible explanations for where dark matter came from and how it may interact with other forms of matter.\n\nChallenging the Cold Dark Matter Assumption\n\nFor decades, scientists believed dark matter had to be cold when it separated from the intense radiation filling the young Universe, a process known as freezing out. Cold dark matter moves slowly, a property thought to be essential for forming galaxies and large-scale cosmic structures. To revisit this assumption, the research team focused on a critical but less explored phase of cosmic history called post-inflationary reheating.\n\nDuring reheating, the Universe was rapidly filling with particles following the end of cosmic inflation. The researchers examined how dark matter could have been produced during this energetic period and what that would mean for its later behavior.\n\nWhy Hot Dark Matter Was Once Rejected\n\n\"The simplest dark matter candidate (a low mass neutrino) was ruled out over 40 years ago since it would have wiped out galactic size structures instead of seeding it,\" said Keith Olive, professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy. \"The neutrino became the prime example of hot dark matter, where structure formation relies on cold dark matter. It is amazing that a similar candidate, if produced just as the hot big bang Universe was being created, could have cooled to the point where it would in fact act as cold dark matter.\"\n\nIn the past, fast-moving particles like neutrinos were dismissed because their high speeds would have smoothed out matter in the early Universe, preventing galaxies from forming. This made cold dark matter the preferred explanation for decades.\n\nCooling Down in Time to Build Galaxies\n\nThe new study shows that dark matter does not necessarily need to start out cold. The researchers demonstrated that dark matter particles could separate from other matter while still ultrarelativistic-or extremely hot-and still slow down enough before galaxies began to form. The reason this works is tied directly to reheating, which provides enough time for the particles to cool as the Universe expands.\n\n\"Dark matter is famously enigmatic. One of the few things we know about it is that it needs to be cold,\" said Stephen Henrich, graduate student in the School of Physics and Astronomy and lead author of the paper. \"As a result, for the past four decades, most researchers have believed that dark matter must be cold when it is born in the primordial universe. Our recent results show that this is not the case; in fact, dark matter can be red hot when it is born but still have time to cool down before galaxies begin to form.\"\n\nLooking Ahead to Detection and the Early Universe\n\nThe team plans to build on these results by exploring how such dark matter particles might be detected. Possible approaches include direct searches using particle colliders or scattering experiments, as well as indirect detection through astronomical observations.\n\n\"With our new findings, we may be able to access a period in the history of the Universe very close to the Big Bang,\" said Yann Mambrini, professor from the Université Paris-Saclay in France and co-author on the paper.\n\nThe research was supported by funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long believed that dark matter, a mysterious substance making up much of the Universe, was cold and slow when it first appeared. This coldness was thought necessary to help form galaxies and other cosmic structures.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from the University of Minnesota and Université Paris-Saclay studied a period shortly after the Big Bang called post-inflationary reheating. They found that dark matter particles could have been moving very fast, nearly at the speed of light, when they first formed. Despite being so hot and fast, these particles had enough time to cool down before galaxies started to form.\n\n**Impact** – This challenges the traditional idea that dark matter had to be cold from the start. It opens up new ways to think about how dark matter came to be and how it helped shape the Universe. The discovery also suggests that dark matter might be detected using different methods than before, such as particle colliders or space observations.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers want to explore how to find this “red-hot” dark matter today. They plan experiments and observations to detect particles that cooled down after being extremely hot, potentially giving new clues about the Universe’s earliest moments.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Dark matter may have begun as a blazing hot, fast-moving substance that cooled over time, changing how we understand its role in forming galaxies and the Universe.",

      "summary": "The first crewed Moon mission in 50 years could launch in February, ahead of a future lunar landing.",
      "content": "When does the Nasa Moon mission launch and who are the Artemis II crew?\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Pallab Ghosh , Science Correspondent and Alison Francis , Senior Science Journalist Share Save\n\nNASA Artemis II Crew: left Christina Koch, back Victor Glover (pilot), front Reid Wiseman (commander), right Jeremy Hansen\n\nThe first crewed Moon mission in more than 50 years could be launched by Nasa as soon as the first week of February. On Saturday, in preparation, Nasa plans to roll out its gigantic Space Launch System (SLS) Moon rocket and Orion Space Capsule from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to the launch pad. The Artemis II mission, which will last about 10 days, could take its astronauts further into space than anyone has been before. It aims to set the stage for an eventual human landing on the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nWhen does Artemis II launch?\n\nSaturday's planned four-mile journey on the crawler-transporter-2 will take up to 12 hours. Once there, engineers will begin a series of launch pad preparations, including connecting ground support equipment such as electrical lines, fuel environmental control system ducts, and cryogenic propellant feeds. At the end of January, Nasa will conduct what it describes as a wet dress rehearsal, which is a prelaunch test to fuel the rocket. If there are any issues, Nasa may roll back SLS and Orion to the Vehicle Assembly Building for additional work ahead of launch. But if all systems are go, the earliest possible launch date would be Friday 6 February. As well as the rocket being ready, the Moon has to be in the right place too, so successive launch windows are selected accordingly. In practice, this means one week at the beginning of each month during which the rocket is pointed in the right direction followed by three weeks where there are no launch opportunities. The potential launch dates are therefore: 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11 February\n\n6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 March, and\n\n1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 April\n\nWho are the Artemis II crew and what will they be doing?\n\nArtemis II's crew of four includes Nasa's commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover and mission specialist Christina Koch. A second mission specialist, Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency, will also be on board. The mission involves the first crewed flight of SLS and Orion. Once they are safely in orbit, the astronauts will test how the Orion spacecraft handles. This will involve manually flying the capsule in Earth orbit to practise steering and lining up the spacecraft for future Moon landings. They will then head out to a point thousands of kilometres beyond the Moon to check Orion's life‑support, propulsion, power and navigation systems. The crew will also act as medical test subjects, sending back data and imagery from deep space. They will work in a small cabin in weightlessness. Radiation levels will be higher than on the International Space Station, which is in low‑Earth orbit, but still safe. On return to Earth, the astronauts will experience a bumpy return through the atmosphere and a splashdown off the west coast of the US, in the Pacific.\n\nWill Artemis II land on the Moon?\n\nNo. This mission is to lay the ground for a lunar landing by astronauts in the Artemis III mission. Nasa says the launch of Artemis III will take place \"no earlier than\" 2027. However, experts believe 2028 is the earliest possible date. The final choice of a spacecraft to take the crew down to the lunar surface has not yet been made. It will either be SpaceX's Starship lander or a craft designed by Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. New spacesuits made by US company Axiom are also not ready. When Artemis III finally flies, the astronauts will be heading to the Moon's south pole. After this, the aim is to have a sustained human presence on the Moon. Artemis IV and V will begin building Gateway, a small space station circling the Moon. That will be followed by more Moon landings, extra sections being added to Gateway, and new robotic rovers operating on the surface. More countries will be involved in keeping people living and working on and around the Moon for longer periods.\n\nWhen was the last Moon mission?\n\nThe last crewed Moon mission was Apollo 17, which landed in December 1972 and returned to Earth later that month. In all, 24 astronauts have travelled to the Moon and 12 of them have walked on its surface, all during the Apollo programme. America first went in the 1960s, primarily to beat the Soviet Union to assert its geopolitical and technological dominance. Once that goal was achieved, political enthusiasm and public interest ebbed, as did the money for future Moonshots. The Artemis programme grew out of a desire to return humans to the Moon, but this time for a longer-term presence built around new technology and commercial partnerships.\n\nDo other countries plan to send astronauts to the Moon?\n\nSeveral other countries have ambitions to put people on the Moon in the 2030s.​ European astronauts are set to join later Artemis missions and Japan has also secured seats. China is building its own craft, targeting a first landing near the Moon's south pole by 2030. Russia continues to talk about flying cosmonauts to the surface and building a small base sometime between about 2030 and 2035. However, sanctions, funding pressures and technical setbacks mean its timetable is highly optimistic. India has also expressed ambitions to one day see its own astronauts walking on the Moon. Following the success of Chandrayaan 3's landing near the lunar south pole in August 2023, India's space agency set out a goal of sending astronauts to the Moon by about 2040. This would be part of a push to move its human spaceflight programme beyond low Earth orbit.",

      "content": "Since launching in 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope has found hundreds of distant and apparently bright galaxies dubbed \"little red dots\", and now it seems they may each carry a baby black hole\n\nA collection of “little red dots” spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, and D. Kocevski (Colby U.)/Space Telescope Science Institute Office of Public Outreach\n\nImpossibly bright galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) may not be so bright after all. These galaxies once threatened to upend our understanding of the cosmos by suggesting it contained monstrous black holes or far more stars than we had anticipated, but astronomers now think the galaxies might actually contain “baby” black holes instead.\n\nIn its first few years scanning the early universe, JWST unexpectedly discovered hundreds of very red and extremely bright galaxies, which astronomers called “little red dots” (LRDs).\n\nThe amount of light coming from these galaxies suggested that they contained either a density of stars that was far greater than any galaxy we know of, and which would be difficult to square with the mass of the universe that we expect, or black holes that were far more massive than astronomers thought possible given the size of their host galaxies.\n\nBoth of these scenarios would have required significant adjustments to our models of galaxy formation and black hole growth in the early universe.\n\nBut these conclusions also rested on the assumption that the LRDs’ red colour was due to an abundance of dust, either around the black hole itself or surrounding the stars, because that is what is typically found in the very red galaxies of our local universe. Recently, that idea has been questioned, after researchers found a lack of evidence that LRDs contain dust after all.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nJenny Greene at Princeton University and her colleagues think that this finding means we need to reconceive what LRDs are. “We were sure that we could detect the dust emission, if indeed they were red because of dust, and then we did not find that emission at all,” says Greene. “That was the big clue that our assumption that they’re dusty is just wrong, that’s not why they’re red.”\n\nPrevious observations had inferred the total brightness of LRDs by measuring a specific single frequency of light, associated with the element hydrogen, which can then be used to calculate the total brightness, based on typical models of how dust affects this light.\n\nIn a new analysis, Greene and her team directly measured the total light emissions from two LRD galaxies by looking at many different frequencies of light, including X-rays and infrared. They found that for most frequencies, apart from visible light, there was much less light being emitted than for typical galaxies, suggesting that the LRDs were at least ten times dimmer than initial estimates suggested. This finding has implications for the black holes inside the LRDs.\n\n“If there’s actually not as much light there as we thought, the black hole masses are probably much more modest,” says Greene. “Then they don’t have to be that over-massive, and we don’t have to have too much mass in black holes at early times, so it really alleviates a lot of the tension that was perplexing us.”\n\nBecause the light emissions suggest the black holes contain relatively little mass compared to standard black holes, team member Rohan Naidu at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says we can think of them as “baby black holes.” He adds that this also fits with an emerging picture that the black holes in the LRDs are actually black hole stars – a special class of black hole surrounded by gas.\n\n“In ordinary black holes, what you actually see with your eyes is the tip of the iceberg of the total energy that is coming out of the system, but the little red dots we now understand should really be thought of as these puffed-up black hole stars,” says Naidu. “It seems that most of their energy is coming out at these wavelengths that we see with our eyes, so what you see is what you get.”\n\nBut Roberto Maiolino at the University of Cambridge says that we can’t be sure about the masses of black holes in the LRDs, because the light being emitted from a black hole tells us about its rate of growth, not about its total mass.\n\nGreene argues that the baby black hole idea is valid. “If there’s far fewer photons [being emitted], it means that the whole mass scale shifts down,” says Greene. “On average, they are lower mass than we thought when we incorrectly assumed that it was a normal accreting black hole buried by dust.”\n\nJournal reference: Astrophysical Journal DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/ae1836",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Since 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has been looking deep into space to study very distant galaxies. Among these are hundreds of tiny, bright red points called “little red dots” (LRDs). Scientists wanted to understand what makes these galaxies so bright and red.\n\n**What happened** – At first, researchers thought the LRDs were either packed with many stars or had huge black holes. Both ideas were surprising and didn’t fit well with what we know about the early universe. But a new study measured the light from two of these galaxies across many types of light, like X-rays and infrared, and found they were much dimmer than expected. This means the black holes inside them are likely smaller “baby” black holes, not huge ones.\n\n**Impact** – This changes how scientists see these galaxies and black holes. Instead of being strange and very massive, the LRDs may be more normal, with smaller black holes that fit better with current theories. It also suggests these black holes might be a special kind called black hole stars, surrounded by gas. This discovery helps fix some puzzles about how galaxies and black holes grew in the early universe.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will study more LRDs to confirm if they all have baby black holes. They will also try to learn more about how these black holes form and grow. This work could improve our understanding of the universe’s first galaxies and the role of black holes in them.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New measurements show distant “little red dot” galaxies likely contain smaller baby black holes, reshaping ideas about early cosmic growth.",

Ces idées surprenaient et ne correspondaient pas bien à ce que nous savons sur l’univers primitif. Mais une nouvelle étude a mesuré la lumière de deux de ces galaxies sur plusieurs types de lumière, comme les rayons X et l’infrarouge, et a découvert qu’elles étaient beaucoup moins brillantes que prévu.

Au lieu d’être étranges et très massifs, les LRD pourraient être plus normales, avec des petits trous noirs qui correspondent mieux aux théories actuelles.
