      "content": "An ancient skull has finally shown us what the Denisovans looked like. Now it turns out they, not Neanderthals, might be our closest relatives, redrawing our family tree and transforming the hunt for Ancestor X\n\nDNA evidence indicates that a skull unearthed in Harbin, China, belonged to a Denisovan Hebei GEO University\n\nOne of the biggest mysteries in human evolution has just been solved. In 2010, a groundbreaking genetic analysis revealed that east Asia was once home to a previously unknown group of enigmatic ancient humans. We knew them as the Denisovans, but until very recently, we had no idea what they looked like.\n\nThat has now changed thanks to a 146,000-year-old skull unearthed in Harbin, China, in mysterious circumstances more than 90 years ago. In June, we learned that it carries Denisovan DNA in the ancient gunk attached to the surface of a tooth, suggesting that the cranium belonged to this ancient relative of modern humans. The discovery shows that these hominins had an unusual combination of features: their faces were similar to ours, but they had thick brow ridges and lacked our tall foreheads.\n\nThis finding closes one chapter of the Denisovan story. But another has just begun – and it looks set to bring even bigger revelations. For one thing, we can expect a new name for this extinct hominin, with at least two rival proposals for what it should be. There will also be a battle over how to accommodate the Denisovans in our family tree, particularly given the suggestion that they are more closely related to living people than any other ancient human – potentially ousting the Neanderthals from their position as our sister species.\n\nThat controversial idea has big implications in the ongoing search for Ancestor X, the population that gave rise to modern humans. It will also prompt a scramble to learn more about Denisovan lives and behaviour – because it is only by studying our closest cousins that we can really understand how we differ from the other humans that once walked the planet.\n\nThe story of the Denisovans, in terms of our recognition of them, begins just a decade and a half ago. They have been a puzzle since their unconventional discovery in 2010. Unlike other ancient humans, all of which are defined by the physical features of their skeletons, these hominins were originally defined solely on the basis of unusual DNA signatures in a tooth and tiny finger bone – both now thought to be between 51,000 and 84,000 years old – found in Denisova cave in Siberia, Russia. That DNA turned out to come from a human lineage that was related to, but distinct from, the Neanderthals.\n\nInterbreeding\n\nBence Viola at the University of Toronto, Canada, who was a member of the team that made the discovery, says the researchers considered placing the fossils in a new species: Homo altaiensis. They ultimately decided not to, in part because the DNA showed that ancestors of living humans had interbred with the mysterious lineage. We now know that there were several episodes of this interbreeding, and that some human populations – particularly in the islands of South-East Asia and Oceania – inherited between 4 and 6 per cent of their DNA from Denisovans.\n\n“Species names are problematic when you’re looking at populations that are so closely related,” he says. The team opted instead to give the lineage an informal name – the Denisovans – which some researchers view as merely a population within our species, Homo sapiens.\n\nThere isn’t universal agreement that this was the correct decision, however. Species can be defined in dozens of ways, many of which allow for a limited degree of interbreeding with other species. This means, for instance, that many researchers argue that Neanderthals deserve to be considered as a distinct species – Homo neanderthalensis – despite evidence that they interbred with modern humans. In a study published last year, Andra Meneganzin at KU Leuven, Belgium, and Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum, London, advocated for this position because the Neanderthals developed a unique set of physical features and exploited resources in a distinct way.\n\nWith such ideas in mind, Christopher Bae at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa recalls being intrigued by the fact that the original Denisovan tooth and a handful of others from Denisova cave were strikingly large. They strongly reminded him of teeth associated with ancient human remains that had been unearthed in China during the 20th century. “I said that it was only a matter of time before the Denisovans were given a Chinese species name,” he says.\n\nThe trouble was, says Bae, that no existing names were available there. Researchers in China had traditionally opted for a simple, linear picture of human evolution and so chose to label any human fossils from the past 200,000 years as either H. sapiens or – if the fossil had a primitive appearance – archaic H. sapiens.\n\nToday, most researchers in China think our evolutionary tree is more complicated. As such, when Xijun Ni at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and his colleagues examined the Harbin skull and concluded it didn’t belong to a Neanderthal or a modern human, they were comfortable with placing it in a new species. In 2021, they named this species Homo longi, derived from a Chinese term meaning “dragon”.\n\nA few years later, in 2023, Bae attended a scientific meeting in Novi Sad, Serbia, to discuss the human evolutionary tree. “We basically agreed that H. longi is OK,” he says.\n\nDenisovan DNA discovery\n\nSo, with news earlier this year that the Harbin skull contains Denisovan proteins and there is Denisovan mitochondrial DNA in the tartar adhering to its single tooth, a strong case can be made for saying the Denisovans and H. longi are one and the same. But Bae doesn’t see it that way.\n\nFor a few years, he has suspected that H. longi wasn’t the only ancient human wandering around east Asia in the Stone Age. In particular, he points to fragments of hominin skulls from Xujiayao and Xuchang in north China that are between 100,000 and 200,000 years old. He says they would have accommodated truly enormous brains with a volume of 1700 to 1800 cubic centimetres – much larger than the 1350 cc of the average living human.\n\nLast year, he and his colleague Xiujie Wu at the Chinese Academy of Sciences placed these fossils and some others in a new species named Homo juluensis, which Bae is convinced is where the Denisovans really belong.\n\n“You just have to look at the molars,” says Bae. The unusually large teeth from Denisova cave are, he says, virtually indistinguishable from the teeth associated with the fossils he and Wu placed in H. juluensis. And while he accepts that the Harbin skull carries Denisovan-like DNA and protein signatures, he suspects that, if DNA can be extracted from some of the H. juluensis fossils, they will provide an even closer genetic match with the remains from Denisova cave.\n\nAs things stand, then, there are now three potential ways to think about the Denisovans. The research community may begin to refer to them as H. longi or as H. juluensis – or a decision may be made to continue using the informal term Denisovan on the assumption that they really belong in H. sapiens. Currently, there is no consensus, but one is needed, says Bae. “You have to give them some kind of name because otherwise it’s really difficult to have a conversation about the variation and the evolutionary history of these human groups.”\n\nNames are particularly important in light of new research. In an as-yet-unpublished study, Ni and Stringer have teamed up, together with other colleagues, and used anatomical information from dozens of ancient fossils to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among species in our human genus. The results led to a radical redrawing of our family tree (see diagram below). Traditionally, the Neanderthals have been viewed as the closest ancient humans to living people. But Ni and Stringer’s team concluded that Denisovans are more closely related to us than the Neanderthals are. According to their analysis, the Denisovans and modern humans last shared a common ancestor about 1.32 million years ago. The Neanderthals branched away from our evolutionary line earlier, around 1.38 million years ago.\n\nNi and Stringer won’t discuss their conclusions until the work is accepted for publication in a scientific journal, but many researchers consider them to be controversial, given they clash with the DNA evidence. Not only does that DNA evidence suggest that Neanderthals and Denisovans are equally closely related to living humans, it also implies that the divergence between the Neanderthal-Denisovan line and our own occurred between 500,000 and 700,000 years ago – far more recently than Ni and Stringer’s team found.\n\n“It’s very clear from the genetic data that a major split between the lineages leading to modern humans on the one hand, and Denisovans/Neanderthals on the other, occurred within the last 500-700,000 years,” says David Reich at Harvard University.\n\nThat being said, Aylwyn Scally at the University of Cambridge says such divergence estimates depend to some extent on the methods used to analyse the genetic data. José María Bermúdez de Castro at the National Human Evolution Research Centre (CENIEH) in Spain also thinks there is wiggle room on the divergence date. “The last common ancestor may be up to 1 million years old,” he says.\n\nLast common ancestor\n\nConventionally, it is believed that this Ancestor X was located somewhere in Africa. But if Denisovans – a group that seems to have been largely confined to east Asia – emerged from the Ancestor X population too, an African location might seem less likely.\n\nSome researchers are already willing to entertain the idea that Ancestor X lived in Eurasia rather than in Africa. In a 2022 study, Bermúdez de Castro and María Martinón-Torres at CENIEH argued that south-west Asia might make more sense, particularly the Levantine region bordering the eastern Mediterranean Sea. “It’s the umbilical cord linking Africa to Eurasia,” says Bermúdez de Castro.\n\nAncestor X might even have existed further east. In their yet-to-be-published study, Ni and Stringer’s team took a fresh look at two complete, but slightly squashed, ancient human skulls found in Yunxian, central China, about 35 years ago. They used software to create an undistorted model of one of the skulls, and realised that its anatomy was almost exactly in line with that expected of Ancestor X. For instance, it has features of our modern human face coupled with a more primitive-looking braincase that originally housed a brain of roughly 1140 cubic centimetres – smaller than that of the average living human.\n\nMoreover, its age – about 0.9 to 1.1 million years old – is roughly in line with the researchers’ estimate for when our last common ancestor with ancient humans roamed the world. As such, they reached a striking conclusion: this Yunxian skull came from a human very closely related to Ancestor X. What other researchers make of such a bold suggestion, however, remains to be seen.\n\nDenisovan behaviour\n\nWith these ideas swirling around the research community, it has never been more important to understand the lives of the Denisovans. This is because assessing how much of a behavioural overlap there was between these ancient humans and our modern human ancestors could provide vital information about our own behavioural evolution.\n\nBut it is difficult to conclude much about Denisovan behaviour without excavating sites that they occupied. We have known since 2010 that Denisova cave is one such location, but ancient DNA indicates that Neanderthals and modern humans also occupied the cave at various times during the Stone Age. This complicates things when it comes to interpreting the artefacts unearthed there, which include plenty of stone tools, bone needles for sewing and even ancient jewellery, such as an ivory tiara and a bracelet of polished green rock. Simply put, we don’t know which Stone Age humans made those artefacts.\n\nOther sites, however, are beginning to offer some insights into Denisovan lives. In 2022, for instance, a research team reported the discovery of a tooth with a Denisovan-like appearance in Tam Ngu Hao 2 – dubbed Cobra cave – in Laos. It suggested that some Denisovans adapted to humid tropical conditions quite unlike those found around Denisova cave – although such a conclusion was tentative given that it wasn’t possible to extract Denisovan-specific DNA or proteins from the tooth.\n\nBut it is Baishiya Karst cave on the Tibetan plateau that is emerging as perhaps the most important Denisovan archaeological site. A study published last year concluded there is DNA evidence that the Denisovans – and no other humans – sporadically occupied the cave between 160,000 and 60,000 years ago.\n\nExcavations have yet to unearth anything as striking as the Denisova cave jewellery, but they are still revealing important information about the Denisovans. Perhaps most interesting is the fact that they occupied the cave at all given the extreme environment in which it is located. “It’s cold throughout the year,” says Dongju Zhang at Lanzhou University, China. “Snow covers the whole area in the wintertime, and you need a thick jacket even in July or August.”\n\nThis fragment of mandible bone, found in Baishiya Karst cave in 1980, now turns out to have been from a Denisovan Dongju Zhang, Lanzhou University\n\nUnsurprisingly, then, Zhang and her colleagues have found evidence that the Denisovans made fires inside the cave. It is also likely that they wore clothing to further protect themselves from the elements, with evidence that they skinned animals including the bharal (Pseudois nayaur), also known as the blue sheep. “We think they took the skins to cover their bodies and keep themselves warm,” says Zhang.\n\nAdding to the challenges the Denisovans faced is that the site is 3200 metres above sea level. “I was at the cave last year for a scientific workshop and the lack of oxygen is shocking – I got a horrible headache,” says Viola. Astonishingly, there are now hints that the Denisovans took to even higher altitudes: in as-yet-unpublished work, Zhang and her colleagues have found evidence of an ancient archaeological site on the Tibetan plateau at about 3700 metres above sea level.\n\nHunting strategies\n\nFinding food on the plateau can be difficult because prey is thin on the ground. This may explain why Zhang and her colleagues discovered that the Denisovans at Baishiya Karst cave hunted a wide range of animals, including large mammals like the bharal and snow leopards as well as rodents such as marmots, and even birds. “It seems they had to use all the animal resources available to them,” says Zhang. To do so, the Denisovans must have developed a range of hunting strategies, because each of their prey species had a unique suite of behaviours.\n\nCollectively, these discoveries paint a picture of the Denisovans as remarkably adaptable. Indeed, some archaeologists have commented that their behavioural flexibility is strikingly reminiscent of modern humans.\n\nBut even as we are finding echoes of ourselves in the Denisovans, we are also identifying subtle ways in which we differed from them. For instance, the stable isotopes in fossil teeth – which can reveal information about the variety of plants and animals an individual ate – suggest that modern humans adapted to hunt and forage in the rainforests of south and South-East Asia tens of thousands of years ago. But a 2023 analysis of the suspected Denisovan tooth from Cobra cave in Laos indicates that our ancient cousins lacked the tools and skill set to do so: they seem to have hunted only on nearby savannahs, says Mike Morley at Flinders University in Australia.\n\nArchaeological discoveries in the years ahead should help us more precisely define the similarities and differences between the Denisovans and modern humans. The odds of making such discoveries received a boost earlier this year. After analysing ancient proteins inside a jawbone dredged up off the west coast of Taiwan, a research team concluded that the bone came from a male Denisovan – providing the strongest fossil evidence yet that the Denisovans really did occupy a vast territory. “The geographic range for Denisovans was likely huge,” says Morley. “Just think how much more there must be to find.”",

Their study was published online in the journal Environmental Research.\n\nA correlation between longer life expectancy and water was clear for those who live within about 30 miles of an ocean or gulf. But for those who live in urban settings and near an inland body of water larger than 4 square miles, the opposite was true. Rural residents who live near water may also reap some lifespan advantages, according to the research.\n\n\"Overall, the coastal residents were expected to live a year or more longer than the 79-year average, and those who lived in more urban areas near inland rivers and lakes were likely to die by about 78 or so. The coastal residents probably live longer due to a variety of intertwined factors,\" said lead researcher Jianyong \"Jamie\" Wu.\n\nThe analysis suggested that milder temperatures, better air quality, more opportunities for recreation, better transportation, less susceptibility to drought, and higher incomes could all be contributors to a better outlook for coastal residents compared to those who live inland.\n\n\"On the other side, pollution, poverty, lack of safe opportunities to be physically active and an increased risk of flooding are likely drivers of these differences,\" said Yanni Cao, a postdoctoral researcher who worked on the study.\n\nThe most critical difference the researchers found is that coastal areas experience fewer hot days and lower maximum temperatures compared to inland water areas.\n\nPrevious research has found a connection between living near water and better health measures, including higher physical activity levels, lower obesity rates and improved heart health.

      "content": "Eating animal-sourced protein foods is not linked to a higher risk of death and may even offer protective benefits against cancer-related mortality, new research finds.\n\nThe study, published in Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, analyzed data from nearly 16,000 adults aged 19 and older using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHAMES III).\n\nResearchers examined how much animal and plant protein people typically consume and whether those patterns were associated with their risk of dying from heart disease, cancer or any cause.\n\nThey found no increased risk of death associated with higher intake of animal protein. In fact, the data showed a modest but significant reduction in cancer-related mortality among those who ate more animal protein.\n\n\"There's a lot of confusion around protein - how much to eat, what kind and what it means for long-term health. This study adds clarity, which is important for anyone trying to make informed, evidence-based decisions about what they eat,\" explains Stuart Phillips, Professor and Chair of the Department of Kinesiology at McMaster University, who supervised the research.\n\nTo ensure reliable results, the team employed advanced statistical methods, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method and multivariate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modelling, to estimate long-term dietary intake and minimize measurement error.\n\n\"It was imperative that our analysis used the most rigorous, gold standard methods to assess usual intake and mortality risk. These methods allowed us to account for fluctuations in daily protein intake and provide a more accurate picture of long-term eating habits,\" says Phillips.\n\nThe researchers found no associations between total protein, animal protein or plant protein and risk of death from any cause, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. When both plant and animal protein were included in the analysis, the results remained consistent, suggesting that plant protein has a minimal impact on cancer mortality, while animal protein may offer a small protective effect.\n\nObservational studies like this one cannot prove cause and effect; however, they are valuable for identifying patterns and associations in large populations. Combined with decades of clinical trial evidence, the findings support the inclusion of animal proteins as part of a healthy dietary pattern.\n\n\"When both observational data like this and clinical research are considered, it's clear both animal and plant protein foods promote health and longevity,\" says lead researcher Yanni Papanikolaou, MPH, president, Nutritional Strategies.\n\nThis research was funded by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), a contractor to the Beef Checkoff. NCBA was not involved in the study design, data collection and analysis or publication of the findings.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many people worry that eating meat and animal protein could increase the chance of dying from diseases like cancer or heart problems. Researchers wanted to understand if eating animal protein really affects how long people live.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists studied nearly 16,000 adults aged 19 and older using data from a large health survey called NHANES III. They looked at how much animal and plant protein people usually ate and checked whether this was linked to death from cancer, heart disease, or any cause. The study used advanced methods to carefully measure long-term eating habits.\n\n**Impact** – The results showed no higher risk of death for people who ate more animal protein. Surprisingly, those who ate more animal protein had a slightly lower chance of dying from cancer. This finding helps clear up confusion about protein and suggests that animal protein can be part of a healthy diet. It also showed that plant protein did not have the same effect on cancer deaths.\n\n**What’s next step** – While this study cannot prove that eating meat directly prevents cancer, it adds strong evidence that animal protein is safe and may be helpful. Future research might explore exactly how animal protein protects against cancer and how it fits best into balanced diets.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Eating animal protein is not linked to higher death risk and may help reduce cancer deaths, supporting its role in healthy eating.\n",

Les chercheurs voulaient savoir si consommer des protéines animales influence vraiment la durée de vie.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Des scientifiques ont étudié près de 16 000 adultes âgés de 19 ans et plus en utilisant des données d'une grande enquête de santé appelée NHANES III. Ils ont examiné la quantité de protéines animales et végétales consommées et ont vérifié si cela était lié au décès par cancer, maladie cardiaque ou toute autre cause. L'étude a utilisé des méthodes avancées pour mesurer précisément les habitudes alimentaires sur le long terme.\n\n**Impact** – Les résultats n'ont montré aucun risque accru de décès chez les personnes mangeant plus de protéines animales. Fait surprenant, ceux qui consommaient plus de protéines animales avaient un risque légèrement plus faible de mourir du cancer. Cette découverte aide à dissiper la confusion autour des protéines et suggère que les protéines animales peuvent faire partie d'une alimentation saine. Elle a aussi montré que les protéines végétales n'avaient pas le même effet sur les décès par cancer.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Bien que cette étude ne puisse pas prouver que manger de la viande prévient directement le cancer, elle apporte des preuves solides que les protéines animales sont sûres et peuvent être bénéfiques. Les recherches futures pourraient explorer comment les protéines animales protègent contre le cancer et comment les intégrer au mieux dans une alimentation équilibrée.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – Manger des protéines animales n'augmente pas le risque de décès et pourrait aider à réduire les décès par cancer, soutenant leur rôle dans une alimentation saine.\n",

      "summary": "In the days leading up to the fall of Goma, the capital of North Kivu in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dr. Thierno Balde slept with a helmet and bulletproof vest beside his bed as shells rattled the walls of his hotel.",
      "content": "Gunfire tore through the dark. Night after night, the 44-year-old physician from Guinea clung to the hope that the besieged city would hold somehow. Then, one morning in late January, the call came: he and the remaining international staff had to be evacuated immediately.\n\n“We took the last flight out,” he recalled.\n\nHours later, Goma was in the hands of M23. The Tutsi-led rebel group, backed by neighbouring Rwanda, had just landed its boldest military victory in the region yet.\n\nFor most, that would have been the end of the story: a narrow escape, a mission cut short. But, as the aircraft lifted from the runway, he knew he would return. The only question was: how soon?\n\n© WHO Dr Thierno Baldé, 45, led the WHO response in Goma after the city fell to M23 rebels in early 2025. (file)\n\nA reluctant interlude\n\nBack in Dakar, where he heads the World Health Organization (WHO) emergency hub for West and Central Africa, Dr. Balde grew restless. Reports of civilian massacres kept trickling out of North Kivu, each new detail cutting deeper. The colleagues he had left behind haunted him. With every grim report, his conviction deepened: his place was at their side.\n\nTwo weeks later, on the day he turned 45, he was tapped to lead the agency’s response in eastern DRC. He kept the assignment from his parents in Conakry, his hometown, to spare them the dread.\n\n“I only told them once I was already there,” he admitted, almost sheepishly. His wife and two children had long since grown used to watching him vanish into the world’s most dangerous crises.\n\nReturn to ruins\n\nIt took him five days to reach Goma. By then, the airport had been shut and the roads pocked with checkpoints.\n\nThe city he found was hollowed out. Power lines were down, hospitals were crammed with the wounded and there was talk of the streets being littered with bodies. Fear had settled on every face like ash after a blaze. “In 15 days, everything had changed.”\n\nHis team was broken. Some 20 Congolese staffers, gaunt from exhaustion, had been trying to hold the city’s fragile health system together. He gave half of them time off to recover, despite knowing every pair of hands was desperately needed – it was the least he could do.\n\nAnd yet, amid the wreckage, a stroke of good fortune: unlike most other UN agencies, the WHO warehouses had not been looted. They became lifelines, providing fuel to power hospitals, surgical kits for the wounded and cell phones to coordinate emergency evacuations.\n\nStill, the numbers were crushing, with as many as 3,000 dead, according to initial reports. “We had to bury everyone intensely, in a very specific timeframe,” he said. The WHO ended up paying local gravediggers to collect the corpses.\n\n© WHO Bodies are being buried with the assistance of WHO personnel in the aftermath of the fall of Goma to M23 rebels in early February 2025. (file)\n\nThe spectre of cholera\n\nOn the day of his return, another illness announced itself: cholera. The first cases had just been confirmed in a MONUSCO camp, where hundreds of disarmed Congolese soldiers and their families had sought shelter after losing the city to the M23 militia. The UN peacekeeping mission’s bases, designed for Blue Helmets, were not built to accommodate a large number of civilians. Sanitation conditions were dire, and the disease spread fast.\n\nThat night, Dr. Balde could not sleep.\n\nThe next morning, he walked into the camp and saw patients stretched out on the floor. There were 20 or 30 people, with only one doctor, he remembered. Two were already dead.\n\nFor days, his team scrambled to hold back the tide – using chlorine for disinfection, protective gear, makeshift triage, and staff recruited and trained on the spot. Vaccines were rushed in from Kinshasa.\n\nRumours rippled through the city\n\nStill, rumours rippled through the city.\n\n“People began saying ‘cholera is exploding in Goma and WHO is overwhelmed.’” He, who had come for humanitarian relief, now found himself with an epidemic on his hands.\n\n“We had to completely re-orient ourselves,” he said. The ghost of another Haiti, where the UN played a role in a cholera outbreak in 2010, hovered over his every decision.\n\nAs if on cue, another disease was spreading. Mpox, once confined to the sprawling camps of displaced people on Goma’s outskirts, now spilled into the city itself. Those camps, home to hundreds of thousands uprooted by earlier waves of violence in the region, were emptied in the chaos of Goma’s fall.\n\n“The patients ended up in the community,” he explained.\n\n© WHO Dr Thierno Baldé (center left) and colleagues visit a WHO-supported health centre providing care to the population around Goma. (file)\n\nSitting across from rebels\n\nThen came the men with guns. One afternoon, they barged into the WHO compound without warning. Were they under M23 orders, fighters acting on their own or mere criminals? It hardly mattered. The staff talked them down, persuading them to leave, but the incident made one thing clear. Without some understanding with the de facto authorities, the agency’s work could be compromised overnight.\n\nSo, Dr. Balde sought them out.\n\n“We mustered the courage and went to meet them,” he said. At the North Kivu governor’s offices, now run by the rebels, he laid down his WHO “Incident Manager” card.\n\n“I told them Ebola can affect everyone, cholera can affect everyone. We are here to contain them.”\n\nA channel was opened. Fragile, but enough.\n\nThe cost of altruism\n\nThere’s a stiff price to pay for helping others. In Goma, the days blurred together. Hours were spent in fevered meetings and evenings spent alone in a hotel where heavily armed men dined at nearby tables.\n\nDuring Ramadan, with the city under curfew, he broke the fast each night with the same simple meal, the city outside trembling with uncertainty.\n\nWhen he returned to Dakar two month later, his blood tests were a mess.\n\n“It was a real personal sacrifice,” he said, “and I’m not even talking about mental health. As a humanitarian, you have to take care of yourself, too.”\n\nA veteran, still marked\n\nDr. Balde is no stranger to disaster zones. Trained in Guinea and Quebec, an associate professor at the University of Montreal, he cut his teeth with the Canadian Red Cross in Haiti after the earthquake, then in Guinea during the Ebola outbreak. Since joining WHO in 2017, he has faced emergency after emergency, including COVID-19.\n\nI did everything I could to go back, but I paid a price.\n\nAnd yet, he admitted, Goma left a mark that few other crises had.\n\n“I did everything I could to go back, but I paid a price.”\n\nIn the Senegalese capital, his family bears that price, too. His children know their father disappears into places where the world is breaking apart. His wife has learned to live with the absence.\n\nStill, when he speaks of those feverish weeks in eastern DRC, one sentence returns again and again, insistent and unshaken: “I had to be there.”",
