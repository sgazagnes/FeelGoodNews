      "title": "This breakthrough could finally unlock male birth control",
      "summary": "Scientists at Michigan State University have uncovered the molecular “switch” that powers sperm for their final, high-speed dash toward an egg. By tracking how sperm use glucose as fuel, the team discovered how dormant cells suddenly flip into overdrive, burning energy in a carefully controlled, multi-step process. A key enzyme, aldolase, helps convert sugar into the burst of power needed for fertilization, while other enzymes act like traffic controllers directing the flow of fuel.",
      "content": "Researchers at Michigan State University have identified a molecular \"switch\" that boosts sperm energy just before they attempt to fertilize an egg. The finding could improve infertility treatments and support the development of safe, nonhormonal male birth control options.\n\n\"Sperm metabolism is special since it's only focused on generating more energy to achieve a single goal: fertilization,\" said Melanie Balbach, an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and senior author of the study.\n\nBefore ejaculation, mammalian sperm remain in a low energy state. Once inside the female reproductive tract, they rapidly transform. They begin swimming more forcefully and adjust the outer membranes that will eventually interact with the egg. These changes demand a sudden and significant rise in energy production.\n\n\"Many types of cells undergo this rapid switch from low to high energy states, and sperm are an ideal way to study such metabolic reprogramming,\" Balbach said. She joined MSU in 2023 to expand her pioneering work on sperm metabolism.\n\nTracking the Fuel That Powers Fertilization\n\nEarlier in her career at Weill Cornell Medicine, Balbach helped show that blocking a critical sperm enzyme caused temporary infertility in mice. That discovery highlighted the possibility of nonhormonal male birth control.\n\nAlthough scientists understood that sperm require large amounts of energy to prepare for fertilization, the exact mechanism behind this surge remained unclear until now.\n\nWorking with collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Van Andel Institute, Balbach's team developed a method to follow how sperm process glucose, a sugar they absorb from their surroundings and use as fuel.\n\nBy mapping glucose's chemical path inside the cell, the researchers identified clear differences between inactive sperm and those that had been activated.\n\n\"You can think of this approach like painting the roof of a car bright pink and then following that car through traffic using a drone,\" Balbach explained.\n\n\"In activated sperm, we saw this painted car moving much faster through traffic while preferring a distinct route and could even see what intersections the car tended to get stuck at,\" she said.\n\nUsing resources such as MSU's Mass Spectrometry and Metabolomics Core, the team assembled a detailed picture of the multi step, high energy process sperm rely on to achieve fertilization.\n\nAldolase and the Control of Sperm Metabolism\n\nThe study found that an enzyme known as aldolase plays a key role in converting glucose into usable energy. Researchers also learned that sperm draw on internal energy reserves they already carry when their journey begins.\n\nIn addition, certain enzymes act like regulators, directing how glucose moves through metabolic pathways and influencing how efficiently energy is produced.\n\nBalbach plans to continue investigating how sperm rely on different fuel sources, including glucose and fructose, to meet their energy demands. This line of research may affect multiple areas of reproductive health.\n\nImplications for Infertility and Nonhormonal Birth Control\n\nInfertility affects about one in six people worldwide. Balbach believes that studying sperm metabolism could lead to better diagnostic tools and improved assisted reproductive technologies.\n\nThe findings may also support the development of new contraceptive strategies, particularly nonhormonal approaches.\n\n\"Better understanding the metabolism of glucose during sperm activation was an important first step, and now we're aiming to understand how our findings translate to other species, like human sperm,\" Balbach said.\n\n\"One option is to explore if one of our 'traffic-control' enzymes could be safely targeted as a nonhormonal male or female contraceptive,\" she added.\n\nMost efforts to create male contraceptives have focused on stopping sperm production. That strategy has drawbacks. It does not provide immediate, on demand infertility, and many options rely on hormones that can cause significant side effects.\n\nBalbach's latest work suggests an alternative. By targeting sperm metabolism with an inhibitor based, nonhormonal approach, it may be possible to temporarily disable sperm function when desired while minimizing unwanted effects.\n\n\"Right now, about 50% of all pregnancies are unplanned, and this would give men additional options and agency in their fertility,\" Balbach said. \"Likewise, it creates freedom for those using female birth control, which is hormone-based and highly prone to side effects.\n\n\"I'm excited to see what else we can find and how we can apply these discoveries.\"\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSperm must dramatically boost their energy levels to complete the demanding journey to an egg and achieve fertilization.\n\nScientists have now uncovered how sperm tap into glucose in their surroundings to power this surge, revealing the fuel source behind their rapid transformation.\n\nThis discovery deepens our understanding of reproductive biology and could open the door to better infertility treatments and innovative, nonhormonal birth control options.\n\nThe research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long known that sperm need a sudden burst of energy to reach and fertilize an egg, but the exact process behind this energy boost was unclear. Understanding this could help with infertility treatments and birth control.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Michigan State University found a molecular \"switch\" that helps sperm quickly increase their energy by using glucose, a type of sugar. A key enzyme called aldolase plays a big role in turning glucose into energy. Other enzymes act like traffic controllers, guiding how the sperm use this fuel. This discovery was made by tracking how sperm process glucose during their final swim toward the egg.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it explains how sperm change from resting to active so fast, which no one fully understood before. Knowing this could lead to new ways to help people who have trouble having children. It also opens the door to creating safe, nonhormonal male birth control by targeting these enzymes, offering men more control over fertility without hormone side effects.\n\n**What's next step** – The scientists will study how sperm use other sugars like fructose and test if blocking certain enzymes can safely stop sperm from working temporarily. They want to see if these findings apply to human sperm and explore new contraceptive methods that could work quickly and without hormones.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Researchers have uncovered how sperm quickly power up using glucose, a discovery that could improve infertility treatments and lead to new, nonhormonal male birth control options.",

Backed by new partnerships with governments, UNESCO, and international science advisory bodies, the initiative is rapidly expanding across continents. Powered by AI and advanced data tools, the movement seeks to shift medicine beyond genetics and toward the real-world factors shaping human health.",
      "content": "A prominent scientific session moderated by the Financial Times, titled \"How the human exposome will unlock better health and medicine,\" will bring together three leaders of the Global Exposome Forum from the United States and Europe. They will update members of the international research community on the progress made since the initiative launched in Washington D.C. in May, 2025.\n\nThe discussion is designed to introduce AAAS attendees to what many consider one of the most significant public health opportunities of our time: understanding the human exposome. Panelists will focus on three core areas. These include the groundbreaking potential of exposomics research, a strategic plan for building a truly global network, and practical approaches to overcoming scientific and policy challenges ahead.\n\nPanel organizer Prof. Thomas Hartung of Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, emphasized the ambition behind the effort. \"We are here to make waves, not ripples. Our Committee Members have been putting in the hard yards over these past nine-months and the surge in interest leading to concrete set-up events and firm commitments is tremendous to see. We have much positive news in the pipeline and during our panel discussion we'll announce three examples representing buy-in with national governments, global scientific institutions and large membership-led organizations.\"\n\nThe event will take place in room West 105 of the Phoenix Convention Center from 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM MST Saturday, February 14th, 2026. It is open to credentialed members of the press attending the AAAS Annual Meeting. Journalists and researchers interested in major public health initiatives and international grassroots collaboration are encouraged to attend and hear directly from leaders in this rapidly advancing field.\n\nThe Human Exposome Project and the Future of Medicine\n\nThe Human Exposome Project is designed to rival, and potentially exceed, the ambition of the Human Genome Project. While the Human Genome Project transformed our understanding of genetics, it addressed only part of the disease equation. Genes are estimated to account for just 10-20% of disease risk. In contrast, biological, chemical, and environmental exposures may contribute to at least 80%.\n\nDespite the scale of that impact, large coordinated efforts to study these exposures have been slow to emerge. That is now changing. Newly formed regional chapters and working groups are scaling up exposomics research by combining A.I., advanced sensor technology, metabolomics, and big data analytics. These teams are actively forming partnerships and working to translate scientific discoveries into policies that benefit broad populations rather than select groups.\n\nThis initiative is designed to align with ongoing global research efforts while continuing to expand in real time and generate meaningful returns. Organizers recognize that integrating complex scientific guidance into policymaking, especially around emerging and sometimes controversial technologies, is essential to long term success. A bottom-up model that engages both citizens and elected officials forms the foundation of the project. Supporters argue that whether addressing childhood autism and asthma, managing cognitive decline in older adults, or regulating microplastics, pesticides, and food colorants, research must focus on understanding how combined exposures influence health outcomes.\n\nSouth Africa and a Pan-African Exposome Network\n\nOn December 1st, 2025, in Pretoria, the South African government leveraged its Science Forum South Africa and the World Conference of Science Journalists, hosted by the Science Diplomacy Capital for Africa (SDCfA), to advance exposome collaboration. National and pan-African experts convened to assess the feasibility of creating a continent-wide exposome network. Senior officials from the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI) also received dedicated briefings. South Africa had previously participated at Deputy Director-General level in the May 2025, Washington D.C. launch of the Human Exposome Project.\n\nOne immediate result of the Pretoria meeting was an agreement for pan-African experts to engage directly with Global Exposome Forum working groups and participate in thematic meetings worldwide. Improving coordination of health data reporting systems has been identified as an early priority. A follow-up workshop is scheduled for early December, 2026, marking one year since the initial gathering. Meanwhile, the SDCfA has indicated its readiness to serve as the founding host of a pan-African exposome network.\n\nScience Advice and Policy Partnerships\n\nProf. Rémi Quirion, President of the International Network for Governmental Science Advice (INGSA), has been an active supporter of exposomics and the growing international consortium behind it. INGSA organized a policy-focused panel during the May 2025 meeting in Washington, D.C., featuring speakers that included chief scientists and leaders from UNESCO, WHO, and the African Academy of Sciences.\n\nSince then, INGSA has facilitated ongoing discussions with the Global Exposome Forum on how 'exposomethics' can be effectively integrated into policymaking. Another high-level session is scheduled for April 29th, 2026, at the Global Exposome Summit in Sitges, Spain. INGSA has also agreed to formalize collaboration with GEF across its 10,000-member network and continental chapters to advise on strategic engagement with science advisory systems worldwide.\n\nOn December 8th, 2025, the Global Exposome Forum also launched a partnership with the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and UNESCO. This collaboration includes a series of focused virtual town halls covering single-cell analysis, genomics, exposomics, and science policy. UNESCO, which participated at senior level in the May 2025 Washington D.C. meeting, is expected to host a follow-up session in Paris on March 3rd, 2026, at Assistant Director-General level. That meeting is intended to prepare for the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between UNESCO and the Global Exposome Forum.\n\nRegional Expansion and Global Summit\n\nMomentum continues to build worldwide. Regional chapters are being established in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as Southeast Asia. In Europe, the European Exposome Forum is organizing the Global Exposome Summit in Sitges, Spain from April 27-29, 2026. Early registration numbers have exceeded expectations, and the event is shaping up to include leading voices in health science, A.I., supercomputing, and forward-looking policymaking.\n\nWorking Groups and Digital Collaboration\n\nCentral to the Forum's strategy is the creation of exposome-focused and sub-domain working groups. These member-driven teams are responsible for defining and tackling some of the field's most urgent scientific and policy questions. Participants from industry, government, academia, and civil society collaborate through a dedicated digital platform designed to support messaging, document sharing, and coordinated international work.\n\nThese working groups represent a core element of the Global Exposome Forum's structure. They reflect its grassroots, member-led philosophy while enabling large-scale coordination across sectors and borders.\n\nFrom Vision to Implementation\n\nCollectively, these developments signal a shift from planning to execution. Through coordinated public and private partnerships, international cooperation, and shared research infrastructure, the Global Exposome Forum is helping move exposomics from an emerging concept to a transformative force in public health and modern medicine.",

      "summary": "A new study suggests that generosity may be more than a moral lesson—it could be shaped by how different parts of the brain work together. By gently stimulating two brain regions and syncing their activity, researchers found that people became more willing to share money with others, even when it meant earning less themselves.",
      "content": "Encouraging two parts of the brain to fire in sync can make people act more generously, according to research published February 10th in the open-access journal PLOS Biology. The study was led by Jie Hu of East China Normal University in China, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Zurich in Switzerland. By aligning activity between specific brain regions, the team found they could slightly increase altruistic behavior.\n\nParents often try to teach their children to share, show kindness, and think about the needs of others. These traits help communities function smoothly. Still, adults differ widely in how selfless they become. Some consistently put others first, while others remain more focused on personal gain. Scientists have long wondered what drives these individual differences.\n\nThe Dictator Game and Brain Stimulation\n\nTo investigate, the researchers recruited 44 participants and asked them to make 540 decisions in a Dictator Game -- offering to split an amount of money with someone else, which they then got to keep. In each round, the payout amounts changed, and participants could end up with either more or less money than their partner.\n\nDuring the task, the team applied transcranial alternating current stimulation to the frontal and parietal lobes. This noninvasive technique was designed to coordinate the firing patterns of neurons in those areas. The stimulation guided the brain cells to align in repeating rhythms, either gamma or alpha oscillations.\n\nGamma Synchrony Increased Generous Choices\n\nWhen the stimulation specifically strengthened gamma synchrony between the frontal and parietal regions, participants showed a modest increase in altruistic decisions. They were more likely to share larger amounts of money, even when doing so reduced their own earnings compared to their partner.\n\nUsing a computational model, the researchers found that the stimulation shifted how participants evaluated each offer. After stimulation, individuals placed greater weight on the other person's outcome when deciding how to divide the money. The authors emphasize that they did not directly measure neural activity during the experiment. Future research combining brain stimulation with electroencephalography could confirm how the intervention changes brain signals. Even so, the findings suggest that synchronized activity between the frontal and parietal lobes plays a role in altruistic decision making.\n\nResearchers Highlight Cause and Effect\n\nCoauthor Christian Ruff states, \"We identified a pattern of communication between brain regions that is tied to altruistic choices. This improves our basic understanding of how the brain supports social decisions, and it sets the stage for future research on cooperation -- especially in situations where success depends on people working together.\"\n\nCoauthor Jie Hu notes, \"What's new here is evidence of cause and effect: when we altered communication in a specific brain network using targeted, non-invasive stimulation, people's sharing decisions changed in a consistent way -- shifting how they balanced their own interests against others'.\"\n\nCoauthor Marius Moisa concludes, \"We were struck by how boosting coordination between two brain areas led to more altruistic choices. When we increased synchrony between frontal and parietal regions, participants were more likely to help others, even when it came at a personal cost.\"",

C’est la première preuve claire que modifier l’activité cérébrale peut rendre les gens plus gentils envers les autres. Cela aide les scientifiques à comprendre comment le cerveau soutient les décisions sociales comme le partage et la coopération.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les futures recherches pourraient combiner cette stimulation cérébrale avec des enregistrements du cerveau pour mieux voir comment les signaux changent pendant les décisions de partage. Les chercheurs veulent aussi savoir si cette méthode peut aider les gens à mieux coopérer dans la vie quotidienne ou soutenir ceux qui ont du mal avec les décisions sociales.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Synchroniser l’activité entre deux zones clés du cerveau peut augmenter la générosité, montrant comment les rythmes cérébraux influencent notre volonté de partager avec les autres.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Los científicos se han preguntado por qué algunas personas son más generosas que otras. La generosidad ayuda a que las comunidades funcionen bien, pero los adultos varían mucho en cuánto piensan en los demás. Los investigadores quisieron saber si la actividad del cerebro influye en la disposición a compartir.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Un equipo de China y Suiza estudió a 44 voluntarios que jugaron un juego en el que decidían cómo repartir dinero con otros. Mientras jugaban, los investigadores usaron una estimulación cerebral suave y no invasiva para hacer que dos áreas del cerebro, el lóbulo frontal y el parietal, trabajaran juntas al mismo ritmo. Cuando las ondas gamma del cerebro estaban sincronizadas, las personas eligieron compartir más dinero, aunque ganaran menos.\n\n**Impacto** – Este estudio muestra que la generosidad puede cambiar según cómo trabajan juntas partes del cerebro. Es la primera prueba clara de que cambiar la actividad cerebral hace que las personas actúen con más amabilidad hacia otros. Esto ayuda a los científicos a entender cómo el cerebro apoya decisiones sociales como compartir y cooperar.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los próximos estudios podrían combinar esta estimulación con escáneres cerebrales para ver mejor cómo cambian las señales durante las decisiones de compartir. Los investigadores también quieren saber si este método podría ayudar a las personas a cooperar más en la vida real o apoyar a quienes tienen dificultades con decisiones sociales.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Sincronizar la actividad cerebral entre dos áreas clave puede aumentar la generosidad, mostrando cómo los ritmos del cerebro influyen en nuestra disposición a compartir con otros.",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 12 February 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00250-3Densely packed arrays of electrical components called capacitors can form a high-fidelity vibration sensor that can be worn on the skin.",
      "content": "When people breathe, speak, sing or clear their throats, their bodies are in constant motion. Air flowing through the lungs, the oscillation of vocal folds in the throat and the rhythmic expansion of the chest all produce tiny vibrations that carry valuable information about physiology and health1. However, constructing a device that can capture all of these physiological signals has remained a challenge2. Writing in Nature Sensors, Cho et al.3 report a wearable vibration sensor that is made from an array of densely packed electrical components called capacitors, which generate electrical signals in response to vibration. The authors’ device overcomes several limitations of previous capacitor-based vibration sensors — it does not require an externally applied voltage, its electrical performance is stable when used on the skin and it can detect vibrations over a wide range of frequencies. This work establishes an improved way to use vibration sensing for personalized health-care monitoring and in devices that are operated by human voices.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00250-3\n\nReferences Lee, K. et al.
