I’m Arielle.\n\nKarissa\n\nAnd I’m Karissa. And we’re working hard to put solutions in view and optimism in movement.\n\nArielle\n\nAll right, we are back with another episode of the podcast to share the solutions from The Optimist Daily this week.\n\nKarissa\n\nAnd if you want these solutions straight to your inbox every day, you can get them in our free daily newsletter. The information to sign up is in the show notes.\n\nArielle\n\nWe’re also on social media, of course, so you can find us @OptimistDaily on basically everything, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok, but on X, we are @OdeToOptimism. So, give us a follow and interact with us on socials.\n\nKarissa\n\nAnd we of course have to thank our Emissaries who are our financial supporters. Thank you so much for keeping the lights on here at The Optimist Daily and really helping the mission of putting optimism out there into the world.\n\nArielle\n\nBut non-financial support is just as important. So if you share this pod with a friend, send the daily newsletter to someone who needs a dose of optimism, interact with us, as I said, on our socials, leave a comment, like, follow, subscribe, whatever, that is a huge help for us.\n\nKarissa\n\nWe’re starting out with our solutions today because we have a couple of announcements at the end of the podcast. Some of the solutions this week on The Optimist Daily include.\n\nArielle\n\nNew method uses sound waves to map soil health, stop famine, and restore farmlands. This simple 15-minute mindset exercise can ease anxiety, science shows. Three organization hacks for type B brains that actually work. I might have to check that one out. I think I’m definitely type B (laughs). And more states and cities are boosting minimum wages in 2026. What does it mean for workers? And I think that’s obviously US-based. What else did we have, Karissa?\n\nKarissa\n\nWell, we had Eight fermented foods that your gut will love (and that taste great too!). India’s social experiment, how paying women directly reshapes welfare, autonomy, and politics. Vision board ideas for adults, how to create one that inspires real change; as we come up on the new year that is a cool solution to take a look at. Scientists build the first fully human bone marrow model to revolutionize blood disease research. And Seven cold and flu season mistakes doctors want you to quit making.\n\nArielle\n\nAll right, I’m actually going to talk about the solution that I didn’t have the time to talk about last week because we kind of fully dug into yours, Karissa.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, it was a great discussion on Australia’s social media ban. Yeah, but we missed your solution, and it’s still very timely because it’s the holiday season.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, well, I guess I’ll jump into it. The title of the solution that I’m going to talk about today is Gift shopping for a loved one with cancer this holiday season? Here’s what actually helps. So, we are headed into peak gift-giving season. And if you have someone in your life who’s going through cancer treatment or is going through any serious illness, you’ve probably felt that extra layer of pressure. What on earth do you get them that doesn’t feel trivial or wrong or just off?\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle\n\nBecause when someone is dealing with really heavy health issues, the meaning of a gift changes. The gifts you give that are hoping to communicate and bring comfort can sometimes miss the mark. Not because you don’t care, but because illness really reshapes what comfort actually looks and feels like.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, and I think a lot of us default to, you know, well, at least I’m doing something, and then later wonder internally if it was really helpful at all.\n\nArielle\n\nExactly. That disconnect between the intention behind a gift and how useful it actually is, is what two sociologists, Ellen T. Meiser and Natalie Rita, set out to study. Both of them were diagnosed with cancer in their early 30s, which would be so scary.\n\nI mean, getting a cancer diagnosis at any age is scary, but me being in my early 30s myself, I can only imagine how my world would be turned upside down by this kind of diagnosis.\n\nBut because of their own experiences, these two sociologists decided to interview 50 millennial women about what it’s really like to receive gifts during cancer treatment. And what they found was pretty striking. Their research revealed a clear mismatch between what people tend to give and what patients actually need. And a lot of that, they argue, traces back to the way cancer has been commercialized and packaged online.\n\nKarissa\n\nInteresting.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, it’s weird to think of such a serious illness becoming commercialized.\n\nKarissa\n\nHow has it been commercialized? What are people most often giving?\n\nArielle\n\nSo, across all 50 interviews, 10 items kept coming up over and over again. Things like fuzzy socks, blankets, adult coloring books, mugs and tumblers, gourmet snacks, herbal teas, inspirational self-care products, flowers, books, and then money or gift cards, often through GoFundMe or similar sites.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, that list sounds very familiar. It’s basically an entire corner of the internet– gifts for someone going through a hard time. And all of those you can kind of find, like, maybe even in, like, a hospital like, gift shop too. So that makes sense.\n\nArielle\n\nThe women in the study really did understand the intention, so it wasn’t like they weren’t grateful.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle\n\nA soft blanket says: I want you warm and comfortable, and flowers brighten up a hospital room or any room. So, none of it is inherently bad. But Meiser and Rita noticed how consistent those gifts were, especially fuzzy socks, and that raised the question, why these same things so often? When they dug into it, they traced a lot of it back to pre-made cancer care packages and online gift guides. You know the ones… they bundled together spa items, teas, candies, beanies, “you got this” mugs, all in one pastel-colored box. The interviewees kept describing gifts that looked almost identical to these curated packages.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, it’s like there’s now a standardized way to buy comfort, kind of almost a template for carrying.\n\nArielle\n\nAnd that’s where it gets really complicated. Meiser and Rita write about how businesses seek to extract economic value out of all aspects of daily life. And cancer has become a surprisingly and horrifyingly lucrative niche. The problem is all the glossy pink ribbons and motivational slogans can unintentionally eclipse the harsher realities of illness. They encourage gift giving that looks soothing from the outside, but doesn’t always line up with what patients actually need on the inside.\n\nAnd sometimes those curated boxes backfire. The research found that their uniformity can signal distance rather than closeness, especially for someone who’s craving individual attention and genuine understanding.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, because if you’ve just been through surgery or you’re in the middle of chemo, getting the same cancer box three times might make you feel like you’re being treated as a category and not as you.\n\nArielle\n\nSo, the most useful part of the study, I think, came when Meiser and Rita flipped the question. Instead of asking, “What did you receive?” They asked, “What did you want?” And the list that emerged looked completely different.\n\nAcross the board, the most valued gifts were the most pragmatic. Things like money or useful gift cards. So, there was one thing on the list, on the original list, that got it right with the GoFundMe and stuff like that.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle\n\nGift cards, especially for groceries, takeout, or pet supplies, were really valued. Meals and meal trains, plus pantry staples for the household. Hands-on help, like childcare, transportation to appointments, cleaning, and yard work. Personal notes or cards, not performative, just real check-ins. And practical self-care items like thick lotions or gentle soaps that don’t irritate treatment-sensitive skin.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, I mean, instead of, “Here’s a cute object to cheer you up,” it’s more like, “Here’s one less thing for you to have to think about.”\n\nArielle\n\nMm-hmm, exactly. These are small, everyday kindnesses that actually lighten the load. Instead of adding yet another item to the bedside table, they support the parts of life that feel heaviest when someone is exhausted or rearranging everything around medical appointments.\n\nOne of the most striking findings from the interviews was this: Almost none of the women they interviewed expressed a desire for non-essential items usually stocked in commercial care packages. What they longed for were gifts that acknowledged how illness disrupts everyday roles: parenting, partnering, working, caregiving. A plant can’t ease financial pressure, but grocery delivery can. A charming mug cannot fold the laundry, but a friend who shows up and says, “Point me to the laundry basket,” absolutely can.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, and that really reframes what thoughtful means. It’s not just, “I saw this and thought of you,” but “I see what your life is like right now, and I’m stepping into that reality with you” and kind of meeting you where you are. And I just love this idea, just in general for gift giving and putting care into how you’re showing up for the people around you.\n\nArielle\n\nThat’s the heart of it. Thoughtful support starts with recognizing what someone’s life actually looks like in this moment. Gifts that align with those real needs carry a specific message. I see the fatigue, I see the logistics, I see the appointments and the paperwork and the childcare puzzle, and I’d like to take one thing off your plate. When patients in the study described feeling cared for and seen, they often pointed to the people who stepped into the messiness of daily life. Not the people who tried to cover it with a cheerful slogan, but the ones who said, “I can take the dog to the groomer,” or “I’m bringing dinner on Tuesday; no need to text back.”\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, and that’s also such a relief for givers in a way, because you don’t even have to find the perfect symbolic object or even pay a lot of money. You can just do something concretely helpful.\n\nArielle\n\nMeiser and Rita encourage all of us to rethink what support looks like, especially during the holidays. Instead of defaulting to the mass-produced idea of comfort, they suggest pausing to ask a few simple questions, like, what responsibilities is this person still trying to juggle? Where might they be feeling the most stress? And what everyday tasks have become harder since their diagnosis? A casserole, a ride to treatment, help feeding the pets, none of these are particularly glamorous. But those are the gestures that recognize the real impact of illness. And their research shows that recognition is often the most meaningful gift of all.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle\n\nSo, as we’re sitting here, mid-December, or actually crawling to late December, looking at our gift lists and feeling that familiar holiday pressure, this study offers a really gentle reframe. If someone on your list is facing cancer or any serious illness, the best gift might not be fuzzy socks this time. Thoughtful support often comes from looking behind the scenes at the fatigue, the logistical strain, the emotional weight they’re carrying. As Meiser and Rita emphasize, small acts can speak volumes when they reduce pressure and restore a bit of breathing room.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, I really love the solution. I think it’s great for, even more than just people you may know who have cancer going through some kind of sickness, but anyone who might be going through a rough time. And maybe instead of a pre-made care package, you could do something like saying, I’m sending you a gift card for your favorite takeout place. I booked a cleaner to come by once this month. I’ll drive you to your appointment and sit in the waiting room with you. Or even, I wrote you a real letter because I know texting can feel overwhelming right now.\n\nArielle\n\nYeah, those choices say, I am paying attention to your reality, not just your diagnosis. So, if people are struggling out there and they’re rushing to find that perfect gift for someone who’s going through a rough time, before you click buy on that generic cancer gift box, you might ask yourself a different question. What would make their day-to-day life even 10% easier? Because in a season that’s already emotionally loaded, a warm meal, help with chores, a quiet note, gift cards, et cetera, everything that we’ve just said, that might be the thing that communicates care in the most human and grounded way.\n\nKarissa\n\nAw. Well, I love this. Thank you for sharing this very helpful guide, Arielle.\n\nArielle\n\nI mean, hopefully people are kind of wrapping up their Christmas shopping, but I know that there are other type B people out there like me who are still getting started (laughs).\n\nKarissa\n\nExactly. Me too.\n\nArielle\n\nSo. What about you, Karissa? What solution caught your eye this week?\n\nKarissa\n\nThe headline that caught my eye is that Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation regains ancestral lands near Yosemite in a major cultural restoration. And I had to share the solution because it’s very, very close to where I was born and raised. The Sierras and the Miwuk people have always been something I’ve been fascinated by. And I remember as a little kid spending a lot of time up in the mountains and in their lands and learning about their traditions at things like 6th grade camp or just when we’d go to different, you know, points of interest around the area. And yeah, it’s just always been something so interesting to me. And I’m glad to see this major win.\n\nArielle\n\nOh, what incredible childhood memories to have. This good news must have been especially heartwarming for you.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, Exactly. So, I’m happy to report that nearly 900 acres of ancestral territory have been officially returned to the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, marking a major milestone in indigenous land restoration efforts in California. The property, which borders Yosemite National Park and the Sierra National Forest, include Hennes Ridge, a culturally vital landscape that once formed part of an ancestral trail in Yosemite Valley. And for the Miwuk people, this transfer represents far more than acreage. It is a reconnection to land they stewarded for generations before being forcibly removed in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nArielle\n\nWell, I can only imagine what a huge deal this is for the Miwuk Nation.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, for sure. As Sandra Chapman, tribal council chair and elder of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation says, “Having this significant piece of our ancestral Yosemite land back will bring our community together and celebrate tradition and provide a healing place for our children and grandchildren. It will be a sanctuary for our people.”\n\nArielle\n\nSuch a beautiful, powerful statement. So how did this transfer come about?\n\nKarissa\n\nWell, the land was transferred from Pacific Forest Trust, a conservation organization that has a track record of working in partnership with indigenous nations. The project was made possible through funding from the California Natural Resources Agency’s Tribal Nature-Based Solutions Program, which supports Indigenous-led conservation and climate resilience.\n\nArielle\n\nI love that. As we’ve reported so many times here at The Optimist Daily, Indigenous leadership is one of the most effective ways to protect the environment, not just in the US, but everywhere.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle\n\nJust a few weeks ago, we were talking about how the world’s first Indigenous-led ocean reserve, the Melanesian Ocean Reserve, is one step closer to reality, which is another huge conservation win.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, exactly. That was super inspiring news as well. And it’s cool for this return because this return actually builds on precedent. In the 1990s, the Pacific Forest Trust helped create the first-ever conservation easement with tribal entities in the U.S., partnering with the Intertribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council. The Miwuk land return reflects a continuation of the effort to align environmental conservation with indigenous land rights. The reclaimed land is more than symbolic, as we kind of mentioned. I mean, Henness Ridge is ecologically rich and culturally foundational. Historically, it’s served as a corridor for deer and other migratory species and formed part of a traditional trail from the Central Valley to Yosemite Valley. And this is where I’m from, so it’s pretty special to hear. It’s also an ideal location for cultural gatherings, environmental education, and traditional ecological practices that were once banned or forgotten under federal oversight.\n\nArielle\n\nI love that this is both a cultural and ecological win.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, me too. Tribal Secretary Tara Fouch-Moore emphasized the practical and cultural importance of this return as well. And she says, “we will be able to harvest and cultivate our traditional foods, fibers, and medicines and steward the land using traditional ecological knowledge, strengthening our relationships with plants and wildlife and benefiting everyone by restoring a more resilient and abundant landscape.” So, this is really encouraging to hear. And the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation plans to use the land to support food sovereignty, ceremonial practice, and land-based education. The community will take an active role in protecting local ecosystems. particularly the tributaries that feed the South Fork of the Merced River, a water source protected under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n\nArielle\n\nSo, I know you said earlier that the reclaimed land is more than symbolic. It has really wonderful practical benefits for the Miwuk people to heal generational wounds and fortify traditions, like you said, that have been stifled over so many years, but the symbolic weight is quite significant, isn’t it?\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, it definitely is. We can’t overlook that at all. The last of the Miwuk people living in Yosemite Valley were evicted by the National Park Service in 1969. And now, more than five decades later, the community reclaims the ability to once again live, gather, and care for the land on its own terms. So, this transfer adds momentum to the growing movement of Indigenous land back initiatives across the United States. And like you mentioned earlier, Arielle, even across the world.\n\nArielle\n\nRight. This is truly a powerful example of how collaborative conservation can protect ecosystems and deliver long overdue justice for native communities, which is exactly the kind of story we love to see here at The Optimist Daily.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, exactly. This just really warmed my heart. So, I was happy to share this one today.\n\nArielle\n\nA local one to you, Karissa. That’s so exciting.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle\n\nI am really struck by how both of the stories we covered today are at their core about people finally getting what they actually need in order to heal and move forward. For folks going through cancer or serious illness, it’s not the cutesy gifts. It’s real practical support that lightens the load. And for the Southern Sierra Mewak Nation, it’s not just symbolic recognition; it’s land, sovereignty, food, culture, and the ability to care for their home on their own terms. Both of these solutions are about being seen clearly and about receiving what matches reality, not just sentiment. In these cases, it’s not just the thought that counts.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, absolutely. It’s really helpful to see those kinds of needs being met in very tangible ways.\n\nArielle\n\nAnd as we head into the holidays, our wish for all of you listening is that you also get what you genuinely need from the weeks ahead. Whether that’s rest, deeper connection, clearer boundaries, more joy, or just a little bit more breathing room than last year. We’re sending you so much care and gratitude for being part of the solution- focused community, and we truly hope this season brings you comfort, warmth, and a sense of grounded hope.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah, perfectly said, Arielle. Happy holidays, everyone. We’re so grateful you choose to spend some of your time with us and with The Optimist Daily.\n\nArielle\n\nAnd looking ahead, we also wanted to let you in on a little update. In the new year, we’re going to be revamping the podcast, refreshing the format, playing with some new ideas, and hopefully giving you even more of what you need to hear. Deeper dives into solutions, more context, and more conversations that leave you feeling informed, but also inspired.\n\nKarissa\n\nYeah. And to make that happen in a thoughtful way, we’re going to take a short break from releasing new episodes until February. We’ll be using that time behind the scenes to put our new plans in motion and make sure we come back stronger, sharper, and more useful to you. So, this is a see you soon, not a goodbye, of course. We’ll still be sharing solutions every day on OptimistDaily.com and in the daily newsletter, so this is the perfect time to subscribe, and of course on social media as well. So, you can absolutely stay connected with us in so many ways while the pod is on pause.\n\nArielle\n\nAnd as always, we love hearing from you. If you have thoughts on today’s stories, ideas for what you’d love to see in the new version of the podcast, or just want to say hi, you can email us at social@optimistdaily.com, slide into our DMs on socials as well. Anything like that will work.\n\nKarissa\n\nExactly. And again, thank you so much for listening, for caring about solutions, and for being part of this community. We can’t wait to be back with you in the new year.\n\nArielle\n\nAnd on that note, season’s greetings to you and yours from us at The Optimist Daily, and we’ll catch you in 2026.\n\nKarissa\n\nWoo, crazy.\n\nArielle\n\nI know.\n\nKarissa\n\nLooking forward to it.\n\nArielle\n\nAll right. Bye, Karissa!\n\nKarissa\n\nBye, Arielle!\n\nArielle\n\nAnd bye to all our listeners. See you soon.\n\nKarissa\n\nSee ya!",

      "personality_title": "New research guides better holiday support for cancer patients; Miwuk Nation regains ancestral land near Yosemite",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – During the holiday season, many people want to give gifts to loved ones facing cancer but often don’t know what kind of support truly helps. Meanwhile, Indigenous communities in the U.S. continue efforts to reclaim ancestral lands that were taken from them long ago.\n\n**What happened** – Two sociologists who experienced cancer interviewed 50 women to learn what gifts and support people with cancer actually find helpful during the holidays. They found that practical help like meal delivery, transportation, and gift cards for groceries are more appreciated than typical cancer-themed gift boxes. At the same time, nearly 900 acres of land near Yosemite National Park were officially returned to the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, marking a major step in restoring their cultural and ecological heritage.\n\n**Impact** – This research changes how we think about caring for people with serious illness by focusing on real-life needs instead of commercialized gift ideas. It highlights that small acts of practical help can make a big difference. The land return is a significant victory for Indigenous rights and environmental protection, allowing the Miwuk people to reconnect with their traditional lands, protect ecosystems, and revive cultural practices that had been disrupted for decades.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers encourage everyone to ask what daily challenges their loved ones face and offer help that eases those burdens. For the Miwuk Nation, the land will be used for food cultivation, ceremonies, education, and environmental stewardship. The podcast sharing these stories will take a short break to improve and return with deeper, solution-focused content in 2026.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Practical support that meets real needs helps people heal, while returning ancestral lands empowers Indigenous communities to restore culture and nature.\n",
      "personality_title_fr": "Une nouvelle recherche guide un meilleur soutien aux patients atteints de cancer pendant les fêtes ; la nation Miwuk récupère ses terres ancestrales près de Yosemite",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Pendant la période des fêtes, beaucoup souhaitent offrir des cadeaux à des proches atteints de cancer, mais ne savent pas toujours quel type de soutien est vraiment utile. Parallèlement, les communautés autochtones des États-Unis poursuivent leurs efforts pour récupérer leurs terres ancestrales qui leur ont été retirées.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Deux sociologues ayant elles-mêmes vécu un cancer ont interrogé 50 femmes pour comprendre quels cadeaux et soutiens sont réellement appréciés pendant les fêtes. Elles ont découvert que l’aide pratique comme la livraison de repas, le transport ou des cartes-cadeaux pour les courses sont plus utiles que les coffrets cadeaux standardisés sur le thème du cancer. En même temps, près de 900 acres de terres près du parc national de Yosemite ont été officiellement rendues à la nation Miwuk du Sud de la Sierra, marquant une étape importante dans la restauration de leur patrimoine culturel et écologique.\n\n**Impact** – Cette recherche change notre façon de penser le soutien aux personnes gravement malades en se concentrant sur les besoins réels plutôt que sur des idées commerciales. Elle montre que de petits gestes pratiques peuvent faire une grande différence. Le retour des terres est une victoire majeure pour les droits autochtones et la protection de l’environnement, permettant au peuple Miwuk de renouer avec ses terres traditionnelles, de protéger les écosystèmes et de raviver des pratiques culturelles interrompues depuis des décennies.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs encouragent chacun à s’informer sur les défis quotidiens que rencontrent leurs proches et à offrir un soutien qui allège ces charges. Pour la nation Miwuk, les terres serviront à la culture alimentaire, aux cérémonies, à l’éducation et à la gestion environnementale. Le podcast qui partage ces histoires fera une pause pour se renouveler et reviendra en 2026 avec un contenu plus approfondi axé sur les solutions.\n\n**En une phrase** – Un soutien pratique qui répond aux besoins réels aide à guérir, tandis que la restitution des terres ancestrales permet aux communautés autochtones de restaurer leur culture et la nature.\n",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Durante la temporada navideña, muchas personas quieren regalar a seres queridos con cáncer pero no siempre saben qué tipo de apoyo es realmente útil. Al mismo tiempo, las comunidades indígenas en EE. UU. continúan sus esfuerzos para recuperar tierras ancestrales que les fueron arrebatadas hace mucho tiempo.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Dos sociólogas que vivieron el cáncer entrevistaron a 50 mujeres para saber qué regalos y apoyos encuentran realmente útiles las personas con cáncer durante las fiestas. Descubrieron que la ayuda práctica, como entrega de comidas, transporte y tarjetas de regalo para alimentos, es más apreciada que las cajas de regalo genéricas relacionadas con el cáncer. Al mismo tiempo, casi 900 acres de tierra cerca del Parque Nacional Yosemite fueron devueltos oficialmente a la Nación Miwuk del sur de Sierra, marcando un paso importante en la restauración de su herencia cultural y ecológica.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta investigación cambia la forma en que pensamos el apoyo a personas con enfermedades graves, enfocándose en necesidades reales en lugar de ideas comerciales. Resalta que pequeños actos prácticos pueden hacer una gran diferencia. La devolución de tierras es una victoria significativa para los derechos indígenas y la protección ambiental, permitiendo al pueblo Miwuk reconectarse con sus tierras tradicionales, proteger ecosistemas y revivir prácticas culturales interrumpidas durante décadas.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores animan a todos a preguntar qué desafíos diarios enfrentan sus seres queridos y ofrecer ayuda que alivie esas cargas. Para la Nación Miwuk, la tierra se usará para cultivo de alimentos, ceremonias, educación y manejo ambiental.

      "title": "Košta: EU has decided to provide Ukraine with 90 billion euros in financial support",
      "summary": "Leaders reached an agreement on financing Ukraine at the last summit in 2025.",
      "content": "BRUSSELS – President of the European Council Antonio Košta stated that the European Union has decided to provide Ukraine with 90 billion euros in financial support for the period 2026-2027. Košta noted that the decision on the aid package has been approved and that EU leaders have committed to implementing it. “We have an agreement. The decision to provide Ukraine with 90 billion euros of support for the years 2026-27 has been approved. We have made commitments – and fulfilled them,” Košta wrote. German Chancellor Fridrih Merc said that the decision was made “unanimously” and that the financial package for Ukraine was approved, with the provision of an interest-free loan in the amount of 90 billion euros. According to him, the funds will be sufficient to cover Ukraine’s military and budgetary needs over the next two years. Merc stated that this decision represents a decisive signal for ending the war, assessing that Russian President Vladimir Putin will agree to concessions only when he realizes that the war will not bring any benefit to Russia. According to him, frozen Russian assets will remain blocked until Russia pays reparations to Ukraine. As he stated, Ukraine will start repaying the loan only after the reparations are paid, and if that does not happen, the EU will, in accordance with international law, use the frozen Russian assets to repay the loan.\n\nHe added that the EU can immediately provide support to Ukraine by using existing European instruments. The countries were forced to agree on an emergency backup plan based on joint EU debt, which Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Vever had insisted on for weeks, and which was considered unlikely until a few hours before the agreement was reached. “The essence is that, after today, our support for Ukraine is guaranteed,” Danish Prime Minister Mete Frederiksen said after the summit ended at three o’clock in the morning.

This adds a legal guarantee and shows a clear message to Russia about the consequences of the conflict.\n\n**What's next step** – The EU will begin providing support quickly using existing tools.

      "summary": "Ambassadors summarized 2025 in the process of European integration.",
      "content": "BELGRADE – The head of the EU Delegation Andreas Fon Bekerat stated today that the EU member states did not agree on opening Cluster 3 in the negotiations with Serbia, but that they will return to this issue next year, and pointed out that there is a strong desire for Serbia to be within the European Union, adding that reforms as well as dialogue are needed for progress. “I think we have shown that with the enormous support we have provided to Serbia. From 2014 to 2027, we have allocated seven billion euros. I think that clearly shows how much we want to have Serbia within the European Union. But for that to happen, credible and tangible reforms are needed,” Fon Bekerat said in a statement to journalists at the European House before the start of the panel “From Denmark to Cyprus: How to make the EU ready for enlargement.”\n\nHe emphasized that in recent weeks it has been seen how committed the EU is to the enlargement process in the example of Montenegro and Albania, and expressed regret that Serbia’s seat was empty at the summit in Brussels. “This was a very good opportunity to talk with other member states, with other leaders of the Western Balkans. And I think that, in order to make progress on the path of enlargement, that dialogue is needed,” said Fon Bekerat. He said that they are hoping for concrete reforms in the area of the rule of law, the fight against corruption, the protection of the independence of the judiciary, electoral reforms, as well as media freedom, and added that the EU delegation is ready to support Serbia in all these areas as well as in issues related to civil society. He stated that within the framework for negotiations between the EU and Serbia, in addition to the area of the rule of law, the normalization of relations with Pristina is also mentioned. He also congratulated Denmark on its presidency of the EU so far. The Ambassador of Denmark to Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia Pernile Kadel said that during its presidency of the EU, that country strongly advocated enlargement and that it will continue to support Serbia on its European path.\n\nShe stated that it is precisely in the Western Balkans that there are concrete steps forward, primarily in Montenegro and Albania, and that they had hoped to achieve more with Serbia during their presidency. “I believe there is no doubt where Serbia belongs. Serbia belongs in the EU, it is a European country located in the heart of Europe. And it is obvious that Serbia needs to do more work in order to continue and accelerate reforms, to seize the opportunity because enlargement is underway,” said Kadel. Speaking about Denmark’s presidency, she stated that it was the eighth in a row and the most difficult due to the geopolitical situation, which is dynamic, primarily because of the war in Ukraine. She said that the theme of the Danish presidency was a stronger Europe and that they were very focused on enlargement. “We were very focused on enlargement from the perspective of saying that we must launch the process when it comes to Ukraine, because Europe’s security is very focused and to a large extent depends on what will happen in Ukraine,” said the ambassador. The Ambassador of Cyprus to Serbia Andreas Fotiu said that his country will assume the presidency for the second time as of January 1 and that one of its priorities will be enlargement. “We have always been firm supporters of the enlargement of the European Union. And of course, Serbia has its place in that policy, and Cyprus, as an honest mediator and friend of Serbia, will work hard, based on Serbia’s performance, to advance the accession process as much as possible in the next six months,” said Fotiu. He added that the latest report of the European Commission identifies the progress or shortcomings that have been recorded in the past year. “Serbia has made progress, but of course there are challenges that remain in the areas identified by the European Commission, including the rule of law, etc. We will work together to register as much progress as possible and create the conditions for all member states, because this is an intergovernmental process, to be convinced that it is time to move forward with the accession negotiations of Serbia,” said the Cypriot ambassador.
