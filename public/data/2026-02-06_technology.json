      "title": "This ultra-thin surface controls light in two completely different ways",
      "summary": "A new metasurface design lets light of different spins bend, focus, and behave independently—while staying sharp across many colors. The trick combines two geometric phase effects so each spin channel can be tuned without interfering with the other. Researchers demonstrated stable beam steering and dual-focus lenses over wide frequency ranges. The approach could scale from microwaves all the way to visible light.",
      "content": "Broadband achromatic wavefront control is a key requirement for next-generation optical technologies, including full-color imaging and multi-spectral sensing. Researchers led by Professor Yijun Feng and Professor Ke Chen at Nanjing University have now reported a major advance in this area in PhotoniX. Their work introduces a hybrid-phase cooperative dispersion-engineering approach that brings together Aharonov-Anandan (AA) and Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phases within a single-layer metasurface. This combination makes it possible to achieve independent achromatic control of light with two different spin states.\n\nDispersion is a fundamental property of electromagnetic waves. While it enables useful wavelength-dependent effects, it also causes chromatic aberrations that become more severe as bandwidth increases. These effects can shift steering angles, move focal points, and reduce spatial accuracy. Metasurfaces, which are flat structures made from carefully designed arrays of subwavelength meta-atoms, offer a powerful way to shape light. However, most existing achromatic metasurface designs are limited in practice to a single spin channel. In other cases, both spin channels are addressed but forced to share the same dispersion behavior. As a result, fully independent control of phase and group delay for both spins within a compact device has remained difficult, even though it is essential for multi-channel and multiplexed optical systems.\n\nCombining Geometric Phases to Unlock Dual-Spin Control\n\nTo overcome this challenge at the level of individual meta-atoms, the researchers developed a hybrid-phase framework in which each geometric phase plays a distinct role. In this design, the AA phase enables what the team calls \"spin unlocking,\" while the PB phase provides \"phase extension.\" Asymmetric current distributions inside each meta-atom cause right- and left-handed circularly polarized (RCP and LCP) waves to reflect along different paths. This separation allows their phase and dispersion properties to be controlled independently.\n\nThe team then fine-tuned the resonant strength of the meta-atoms to independently adjust the group delay for each spin. At the same time, frequency tuning and local structural rotation were used to set the phase while keeping unwanted crosstalk low. The PB phase, added through global rotation, extends the available phase range toward a full 2π without significantly altering the group delay design. Together, these elements create a practical single-layer design strategy for dual-spin achromatic control.\n\nExperimental Proof Across Multiple Frequency Bands\n\nThe researchers demonstrated their approach experimentally using two types of devices operating in the 8-12 GHz range. One class consisted of spin-unlocked achromatic beam deflectors that maintained stable, spin-dependent steering across the band. The other involved achromatic metalenses that assigned different focusing functions to RCP and LCP light while preserving strong performance over a broad frequency range.\n\nIn addition, the team presented designs that apply the same principles in the 0.8-1.2 THz terahertz range. This shows that the method is not restricted to a single part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but instead represents a broadly applicable dispersion-engineering framework.\n\nToward More Versatile Meta-Optical Systems\n\nThis work moves achromatic metasurfaces beyond single-channel correction and into the realm of fully independent dual-spin meta-optics. By treating the two spin states as genuinely separate degrees of freedom, the approach enables compact optical systems with multiple functions built into a single device. Looking ahead, the hybrid-phase design strategy could be extended into the visible range for polarization-multiplexed imaging and broadband integrated optics. The researchers also note that inverse-design methods, including genetic algorithms and deep learning, could help speed up device optimization and support real-world system deployment.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists want to control light better for things like color imaging and sensing. Usually, special flat surfaces called metasurfaces can shape light, but they only work well with one type of light spin or treat both spins the same, limiting their usefulness.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Nanjing University created a new metasurface that uses two special geometric effects to control light with two different spins independently. They combined the Aharonov-Anandan (AA) and Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phases in one thin layer. This lets the surface bend and focus right- and left-handed circularly polarized light separately, without mixing them up. They tested their design with devices that steer light beams and focus lenses, working well across a wide range of frequencies from microwaves to terahertz.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time a single-layer metasurface can fully control two types of light spin independently and across many colors or frequencies. It means future optical devices can be smaller and do more jobs at once, like improving color cameras or sensors that see different light types. The design also avoids problems like blurry images caused by color changes.\n\n**What's next step** – The team plans to expand this technology to visible light, which humans can see, so it could be used in everyday cameras and optical gadgets.

      "content": "Civil engineer Zheng Hehui invented Lego-like blocks, used in the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge pylons, as part of his practical PhD.Credit: Cynthia Lee/Alamy\n\nLast month, Zheng Hehui gave an oral defence of his PhD in civil engineering at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. But Zheng had not written a thesis. Instead, he talked about a product he had developed: a set of Lego-like blocks, made with reinforced steel, that fit together to form a bridge pylon.\n\nZheng is among the first cohort of Chinese doctoral students to be assessed on the basis of practical achievements that lead to new products, techniques, projects and installations. His invention is being used in a huge cable-stayed rail and road bridge built across the Yangtze River.\n\nSince September, at least 11 such ‘practical PhD’ students, all engineers, have obtained their doctoral degrees through this route. Their work includes the development and application of a welding technique and its equipment, and the creation of a fire-fighting system for a large seaplane. Universities in other countries offer ‘industrial PhDs’, for which students work closely with a company, but many of these degrees still require a written thesis.\n\nPractical PhDs are part of the Chinese government’s broader education reforms, which started in 2010, to cultivate ‘elite engineers’ that can help to boost innovation in the country. In 2022, the government instructed top-tier universities to team up with major companies to set up graduate colleges for engineers.\n\nA law passed in 2024 allows universities to let master’s and PhD students graduate on the basis of practical achievements. At present, only students in engineering-related subjects are eligible for this no-thesis arrangement.\n\nReal-world problems\n\nThis alternative degree-granting model is important and urgently needed, says Guo Tong, a civil engineer at Southeast University. “[It] can guide students to carry out real research that can solve real-life problems in those industries that carry strategic importance or have technological choke points in China.”\n\nFor Li Jiang, an information scientist at Nanjing University, the new evaluation model addresses a problem that has dogged the education of engineers: “There is a big gap between the theoretical knowledge they learn from books and the hands-on ability our society needs from them.”\n\nCandidates for the practical PhDs have to make prototypes and prove that their inventions can be used in real-life and at scale, according to Sun Yutao, who researches innovation policy at Dalian University of Technology in China.\n\nFuture talent\n\nThe programme is part of China’s effort to build a talent pool for key and emerging industries, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, to drive innovation, Zhu Xiumei, a deputy director at the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said at a press conference in December.\n\nOver the past three years, 50 graduate colleges for engineers have been established in China to bring the policy into practice. Students at these colleges work with two supervisors simultaneously: one with an academic background, the other with solid practical experience. During oral examinations, they are evaluated by a panel comprising both scholars and practising engineers.\n\n“Many engineering professors in Chinese universities have always been academics and never worked in the industry. That is why it is important to pair them up with experts from the industry to teach those PhDs,” Li says.\n\nTsinghua University in Beijing, for example, has partnered with 56 companies in 14 key sectors over the past three years, its vice-president Wu Huaqiang said at the press conference. Under the programme, the university has recruited 1,430 graduate students, who have solved many industrial problems and received more than 100 patents, Wu said.\n\nSome of the universities offering the programme have courses with strong links to national defence. One, Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi’an, is working with 16 major Chinese groups, including China North Industries Group, which makes weapons and military equipment.",

      "summary": "Deep inside Earth, two massive hot rock structures have been quietly shaping the planet’s magnetic field for millions of years. Using ancient magnetic records and advanced simulations, scientists discovered that these formations influence the movement of liquid iron in Earth’s core. Some parts of the magnetic field remained stable over vast stretches of time, while others changed dramatically.",
      "content": "Reaching the deepest parts of Earth is far more difficult than traveling through space. Humans have journeyed roughly 25 billion km beyond our planet, yet drilling beneath Earth's surface has only reached a depth of just over 12 km. This extreme limitation means scientists still know relatively little about what lies far below the crust.\n\nThat knowledge gap is especially important near the boundary between the mantle and the core. This region represents the most critical internal boundary within Earth and is now the focus of new research revealing unexpected magnetic behavior.\n\nGiant Hot Rock Structures Beneath Africa and the Pacific\n\nIn a study published in Nature Geoscience, a research team led by the University of Liverpool found magnetic evidence that two massive, intensely hot rock formations at the base of Earth's mantle influence the liquid outer core beneath them. These structures sit about 2,900 kilometers below Africa and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe findings suggest that these enormous bodies of solid, superheated rock -- surrounded by a pole-to-pole ring of cooler material -- have played a role in shaping Earth's magnetic field for millions of years.\n\nCombining Ancient Magnetism With Supercomputer Models\n\nReconstructing ancient magnetic fields and modeling the processes that generate them is extremely challenging. To investigate these deep-Earth features, the scientists combined palaeomagnetic data with advanced computer simulations of the geodynamo -- the movement of liquid iron in the outer core that produces Earth's magnetic field in a way similar to how a wind-turbine generates electricity.\n\nThese numerical models allowed the team to recreate key features of Earth's magnetic behavior over the past 265 million years. Even with access to a supercomputer, running simulations across such vast timescales requires immense computational effort.\n\nUneven Heat at the Core Mantle Boundary\n\nThe results showed that the upper boundary of the outer core does not have a uniform temperature. Instead, it contains sharp thermal contrasts, with localized hot zones sitting beneath the continent sized rock structures.\n\nThe analysis also revealed that some components of Earth's magnetic field have remained relatively stable for hundreds of millions of years, while other aspects have changed dramatically over time.\n\nAndy Biggin, Professor of Geomagnetism at the University of Liverpool, said: \"These findings suggest that there are strong temperature contrasts in the rocky mantle just above the core and that, beneath the hotter regions, the liquid iron in the core may stagnate rather than participate in the vigorous flow seen beneath the cooler regions.\n\n\"Gaining such insights into the deep Earth on very long timescales strengthens the case for using records of the ancient magnetic field to understand both the dynamic evolution of the deep Earth and its more stable properties.\n\n\"These findings also have important implications for questions surrounding ancient continental configurations -- such as the formation and breakup of Pangaea -- and may help resolve long-standing uncertainties in ancient climate, palaeobiology, and the formation of natural resources. These areas have assumed that Earth's magnetic field, when averaged over long periods, behaved as a perfect bar magnet aligned with the planet's rotational axis. Our findings are that this may not quite be true.\"\n\nResearch Team and Publication Details\n\nThe study was carried out by scientists from the DEEP (Determining Earth Evolution using Palaeomagnetism) research group within the University of Liverpool's School of Environmental Sciences, working alongside researchers from the University of Leeds.\n\nProfessor Biggin and his team focus on studying magnetic signals preserved in rocks collected from around the world to reconstruct the history of Earth's magnetic field and the planet's internal dynamics.\n\nDEEP was established in 2017 with funding from the Leverhulme Trust and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).",

Some studies have shown that harnessing quantumness in this way can result in faster charging, but the practicality and usefulness of quantum batteries remain open questions.\n\n“Many future quantum technologies will need their quantum versions of batteries,” says Dian Tan at Hefei National Laboratory in China. “While significant progress has been made in the development of quantum computation, communication and sensing, the energy-storage mechanisms for these quantum systems have not been fully explored.”\n\nTan and his colleagues built a battery using 12 qubits made from tiny superconducting circuits, each of which they could control with microwaves. Every qubit played the role of a battery cell and also interacted with its nearest neighbours.\n\nThe researchers could control those interactions, so they experimented with two different charging protocols. One mimicked how conventional, or classical, batteries get charged, so it didn’t use these quantum interactions, but the other protocol did. The team found that using quantum interactions between the qubits made the battery attain more power on average, more quickly.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Daily The latest on what’s new in science and why it matters each day.

It is important that this worked with each qubit interacting only with its nearest neighbour, he says, because that is standard for superconducting quantum computers, and engineering more of these advantageous interactions would be practically difficult.\n\nJames Quach at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia says that, until now, quantum battery charging experiments have used, for example, molecules instead of components of an existing quantum device. Quach and his colleagues have previously theorised that quantum computers powered by quantum batteries could be more efficient and easier to make larger, which would make them more powerful. “This was a theoretical idea that we proposed only recently, but the new work could really be used as the basis to power future quantum computers,” he says.\n\nHowever, making precise comparisons between conventional and quantum batteries is difficult, says Dominik Šafránek at Charles University in the Czech Republic. In his view, there is currently no obvious way to translate the measured quantum battery advantages into unambiguously useful devices.\n\nKavan Modi at the Singapore University of Technology and Design says for qubits that interact only with their nearest neighbour, his team’s mathematical work has shown there can be only modest charging advantages, which could easily be cancelled out by other properties of real-life quantum computers, such as their noisiness or slow qubit control.\n\nAt the same time, quantum computers may end up being much more energetically costly than conventional computers, so studying how energy can be moved within them may become a necessity if we are to build very large quantum computers, says Modi.\n\nTan says he sees energy storage for quantum technologies, such as quantum computers, as the ideal use case for his team’s quantum battery. The researchers now want to combine their battery with a qubit-based quantum heat engine, which would produce energy that could then be stored in the battery, all within a quantum computer.",
