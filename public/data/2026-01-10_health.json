      "title": "Stanford’s AI spots hidden disease warnings that show up while you sleep",
      "summary": "Stanford researchers have developed an AI that can predict future disease risk using data from just one night of sleep. The system analyzes detailed physiological signals, looking for hidden patterns across the brain, heart, and breathing. It successfully forecast risks for conditions like cancer, dementia, and heart disease. The results suggest sleep contains early health warnings doctors have largely overlooked.",
      "content": "A restless night often leads to fatigue the next day, but it may also signal health problems that emerge much later. Scientists at Stanford Medicine and their collaborators have developed an artificial intelligence system that can examine body signals from a single night of sleep and estimate a person's risk of developing more than 100 different medical conditions.\n\nThe system, called SleepFM, was trained using almost 600,000 hours of sleep recordings from 65,000 individuals. These recordings came from polysomnography, an in-depth sleep test that uses multiple sensors to track brain activity, heart function, breathing patterns, eye movement, leg motion, and other physical signals during sleep.\n\nSleep Studies Hold Untapped Health Data\n\nPolysomnography is considered the gold standard for evaluating sleep and is typically performed overnight in a laboratory setting. While it is widely used to diagnose sleep disorders, researchers realized it also captures a vast amount of physiological information that has rarely been fully analyzed.\n\n\"We record an amazing number of signals when we study sleep,\" said Emmanual Mignot, MD, PhD, the Craig Reynolds Professor in Sleep Medicine and co-senior author of the new study, which will publish Jan. 6 in Nature Medicine. \"It's a kind of general physiology that we study for eight hours in a subject who's completely captive. It's very data rich.\"\n\nIn routine clinical practice, only a small portion of this information is examined. Recent advances in artificial intelligence now allow researchers to analyze these large and complex datasets more thoroughly. According to the team, this work is the first to apply AI to sleep data on such a massive scale.\n\n\"From an AI perspective, sleep is relatively understudied. There's a lot of other AI work that's looking at pathology or cardiology, but relatively little looking at sleep, despite sleep being such an important part of life,\" said James Zou, PhD, associate professor of biomedical data science and co-senior author of the study.\n\nTeaching AI the Patterns of Sleep\n\nTo unlock insights from the data, the researchers built a foundation model, a type of AI designed to learn broad patterns from very large datasets and then apply that knowledge to many tasks. Large language models like ChatGPT use a similar approach, though they are trained on text rather than biological signals.\n\nSleepFM was trained on 585,000 hours of polysomnography data collected from patients evaluated at sleep clinics. Each sleep recording was divided into five-second segments, which function much like words used to train language-based AI systems.\n\n\"SleepFM is essentially learning the language of sleep,\" Zou said.\n\nThe model integrates multiple streams of information, including brain signals, heart rhythms, muscle activity, pulse measurements, and airflow during breathing, and learns how these signals interact. To help the system understand these relationships, the researchers developed a training method called leave-one-out contrastive learning. This approach removes one type of signal at a time and asks the model to reconstruct it using the remaining data.\n\n\"One of the technical advances that we made in this work is to figure out how to harmonize all these different data modalities so they can come together to learn the same language,\" Zou said.\n\nPredicting Future Disease From Sleep\n\nAfter training, the researchers adapted the model for specific tasks. They first tested it on standard sleep assessments, such as identifying sleep stages and evaluating sleep apnea severity. In these tests, SleepFM matched or exceeded the performance of leading models currently in use.\n\nThe team then pursued a more ambitious objective: determining whether sleep data could predict future disease. To do this, they linked polysomnography records with long-term health outcomes from the same individuals. This was possible because the researchers had access to decades of medical records from a single sleep clinic.\n\nThe Stanford Sleep Medicine Center was founded in 1970 by the late William Dement, MD, PhD, who is widely regarded as the father of sleep medicine. The largest group used to train SleepFM included about 35,000 patients between the ages of 2 and 96. Their sleep studies were recorded at the clinic between 1999 and 2024 and paired with electronic health records that followed some patients for as long as 25 years.\n\n(The clinic's polysomnography recordings go back even further, but only on paper, said Mignot, who directed the sleep center from 2010 to 2019.)\n\nUsing this combined dataset, SleepFM reviewed more than 1,000 disease categories and identified 130 conditions that could be predicted with reasonable accuracy using sleep data alone. The strongest results were seen for cancers, pregnancy complications, circulatory diseases, and mental health disorders, with prediction scores above a C-index of 0.8.\n\nHow Prediction Accuracy Is Measured\n\nThe C-index, or concordance index, measures how well a model can rank people by risk. It reflects how often the model correctly predicts which of two individuals will experience a health event first.\n\n\"For all possible pairs of individuals, the model gives a ranking of who's more likely to experience an event -- a heart attack, for instance -- earlier. A C-index of 0.8 means that 80% of the time, the model's prediction is concordant with what actually happened,\" Zou said.\n\nSleepFM performed especially well when predicting Parkinson's disease (C-index 0.89), dementia (0.85), hypertensive heart disease (0.84), heart attack (0.81), prostate cancer (0.89), breast cancer (0.87), and death (0.84).\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised that for a pretty diverse set of conditions, the model is able to make informative predictions,\" Zou said.\n\nZou also noted that models with lower accuracy, often around a C-index of 0.7, are already used in medical practice, such as tools that help predict how patients might respond to certain cancer treatments.\n\nUnderstanding What the AI Sees\n\nThe researchers are now working to improve SleepFM's predictions and better understand how the system reaches its conclusions. Future versions may incorporate data from wearable devices to expand the range of physiological signals.\n\n\"It doesn't explain that to us in English,\" Zou said. \"But we have developed different interpretation techniques to figure out what the model is looking at when it's making a specific disease prediction.\"\n\nThe team found that while heart-related signals were more influential in predicting cardiovascular disease and brain-related signals played a larger role in mental health predictions, the most accurate results came from combining all types of data.\n\n\"The most information we got for predicting disease was by contrasting the different channels,\" Mignot said. Body constituents that were out of sync -- a brain that looks asleep but a heart that looks awake, for example -- seemed to spell trouble.\n\nRahul Thapa, a PhD student in biomedical data science, and Magnus Ruud Kjaer, a PhD student at Technical University of Denmark, are co-lead authors of the study.\n\nResearchers from the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen University Hospital -Rigshospitalet, BioSerenity, University of Copenhagen and Harvard Medical School contributed to the work.\n\nThe study received funding from the National Institutes of Health (grant R01HL161253), Knight-Hennessy Scholars and Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub.",

      "summary": "Scientists at USC are launching a new trial to test a tiny stem cell implant that could restore vision in people with advanced dry macular degeneration. The hair-thin patch replaces damaged retinal cells responsible for sharp, central vision. Earlier studies showed the implant was safe and helped some patients see better. Researchers now hope it can deliver meaningful, lasting improvements in eyesight.",
      "content": "Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of vision loss and blindness among Americans age 65 and older. The disease worsens over time and primarily damages central vision, making it difficult to see faces, read text or focus on objects directly ahead. As the condition progresses, people may experience blurry areas, dark patches or blind spots in the center of their vision.\n\nResearchers are now launching a new clinical trial that could offer hope to people with advanced dry age-related macular degeneration. This form of the disease is the most widespread and currently has very limited treatment options.\n\nScientists at the USC Roski Eye Institute, part of Keck Medicine of USC, are beginning a phase 2b clinical trial to test whether stem cells can be used to replace damaged retinal cells and potentially restore vision. The stem cells are attached to an ultra-thin implant, thinner than a strand of hair, designed to hold the cells in place once inserted into the eye.\n\n\"We are hoping to determine if the stem-cell based retinal implant can not only stop the progression of dry age-related macular degeneration, but actually improve patients' vision,\" said Sun Young Lee, MD, PhD, a retinal surgeon with Keck Medicine and principal investigator of the Keck Medicine study site. \"The findings could be groundbreaking because while there are a few treatments available that delay the progress of macular degeneration, there are none able to reverse the damage already done.\"\n\nEncouraging Results From Earlier Research\n\nThe new trial builds on earlier research conducted by USC Roski Eye Institute specialists involving a small group of patients. That initial study found the implant was safe, remained securely positioned in the eye and was successfully absorbed into the retinal tissue. Notably, 27% of participants experienced some level of vision improvement.\n\n\"The earlier phase of the clinical trial showed the treatment to be safe with the potential to benefit patients' vision; this next phase will investigate whether the therapy can achieve clinically significant improvements in vision,\" said Lee, who is also an associate professor of ophthalmology and physiology & neuroscience at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.\n\nHow the Retinal Implant Is Designed to Work\n\nRoughly 20 million Americans are living with age-related macular degeneration. This figure includes people with wet macular degeneration, which is less common but typically more severe.\n\nThe disease affects the macula, a small area at the center of the retina that is essential for sharp, detailed vision. In advanced stages, cells known as retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells become damaged or stop functioning. These cells play a critical role in maintaining healthy vision, and their loss leads directly to visual decline.\n\nThe implant being tested in the trial is created from embryonic stem cells that are grown in a laboratory and developed into RPE cells. During an outpatient surgical procedure, Keck Medicine eye surgeons will place a thin layer of these lab-grown cells directly into the retina.\n\n\"The study will explore if the lab-engineered implant will take over for the damaged cells, function as normal RPE cells would, and improve vision for patients who may currently have no other options for improvement,\" said Rodrigo Antonio Brant Fernandes, MD, PhD, an ophthalmologist with Keck Medicine and the study surgeon.\n\nClinical Trial Locations and Patient Eligibility\n\nKeck Medicine is one of five sites nationwide participating in the clinical trial. The study is masked, meaning some participants will receive the actual implant while others will undergo a simulated procedure.\n\nTo qualify, patients must be between the ages of 55-90 and have advanced dry age-related macular degeneration along with geographic atrophy, a condition in which RPE cells are damaged or no longer function properly.\n\nParticipants will be followed for at least one year so researchers can evaluate how well the implant is tolerated and track any changes in vision. The study aims to enroll 24 patients in total.\n\nThose interested in learning more about the trial can contact Mariana Edwards at [email protected] or Kimberly Rodriguez at [email protected].\n\nLong-Term Vision for Stem Cell Eye Treatments\n\n\"The USC Roski Eye Institute is dedicated to furthering innovative treatments to help improve lives by restoring vision,\" said Mark S. Humayun, MD, PhD, co-director of the USC Roski Eye Institute, director of the USC Ginsberg Institute for Biomedical Therapeutics and the Dennis and Michele Slivinski Chair in Macular Degeneration Research at the Keck School. \"Stem cell-derived retinal implants may offer one of the greatest possibilities for helping patients with dry age-related macular degeneration and one day, may offer a cure.\"\n\nThe bioengineered RPE retinal implant is produced by Regenerative Patch Technologies LLC, a clinical-stage company focused on developing stem cell-based implants for retinal diseases. Humayun co-invented the implant and is also a co-founder of the company.\n\nThe technology used to manufacture the implant is exclusively licensed to Regenerative Patch Technologies by the University of Southern California, the California Institute of Technology and the University of California Santa Barbara.\n\nFunding for the clinical trial comes in part from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the Marcus Foundation and USC.",

      "summary": "Researchers have developed a new class of antibodies that amplify the immune system’s ability to fight cancer. By clustering immune receptors that normally receive weak signals from tumors, these four-pronged antibodies push T cells into full attack mode. In early studies, they outperformed conventional antibodies at activating cancer-killing immune cells. The work opens the door to more effective immunotherapy treatments.",
      "content": "Scientists at the University of Southampton have developed a new strategy designed to strengthen how the immune system responds to cancer. The approach aims to help immune cells recognize and attack tumors more effectively.\n\nThe findings were reported in the journal Nature Communications. In the study, researchers tested specially engineered antibodies designed to more strongly activate T cells, the immune cells responsible for killing cancer cells.\n\nHow Antibodies Can Boost Immune Signals\n\nThese antibodies work by grabbing and clustering several immune cell receptors at once, which increases the strength of the signal that tells a T cell to attack cancer. When these signals are stronger, T cells are more likely to launch a full immune response.\n\nThe research team from the University of Southampton's Centre for Cancer Immunology focused on a receptor called CD27. This receptor needs a matching key (ligand) to activate T cells. During infections, the body naturally produces this ligand, but cancer cells do not. Without it, T cells receive only a weak activation signal and struggle to attack tumors effectively.\n\nWhy Traditional Antibodies Fall Short\n\nAntibodies can sometimes act like a master key, helping trigger immune responses. However, most antibodies used in medicine today have a Y shaped structure with two arms, which limits them to binding just two receptors at a time.\n\nAlthough antibody based treatments have transformed cancer care, they do not work for every patient. In some cancers, T cells still fail to become fully active because they are missing the combination of signals needed to mount a strong attack.\n\nA Four Pronged Antibody Design\n\nThe antibodies developed in this study were built with four binding arms instead of two. This allows them to attach to more receptors simultaneously. They also recruit a second immune cell, which forces all the CD27 receptors being held to gather together. This clustering greatly amplifies the activation signal and closely mimics how CD27 is triggered naturally in the body.\n\nProfessor Aymen Al Shamkhani at the University of Southampton, who led the research, said: \"We already understood how the body's natural CD27 signal switches on T cells, but turning that knowledge into a medicine was the real challenge. Antibodies are reliable molecules that make excellent drugs. However, the natural antibody format was not powerful enough, so we had to create a more effective version.\"\n\nStronger Activation of Cancer Fighting T Cells\n\nLaboratory tests using mice and human immune cells showed that the new antibodies were much better at activating CD8+ T cells than standard Y shaped antibodies. CD8+ T cells are often described as the special forces of the immune system because of their ability to directly destroy cancer cells. The enhanced activation led to a stronger anti tumor response.\n\nBy making CD27 easier to target with therapy, the research offers a roadmap for developing new immunotherapy treatments that better harness the immune system's natural power.\n\nProfessor Al Shamkhani added: \"This approach could help improve future cancer treatments by allowing the immune system to work closer to its full potential.\"\n\nThe study was funded by Cancer Research UK and highlights the Centre for Cancer Immunology's role in advancing innovative approaches to cancer immunotherapy.",

L’étude a montré que ces anticorps fonctionnaient mieux que les anticorps classiques lors de tests en laboratoire avec des souris et des cellules humaines.\n\n**Impact** – Cette nouvelle conception rend les cellules immunitaires qui combattent le cancer beaucoup plus actives. Comme les cellules T sont comme les forces spéciales du corps contre le cancer, une activation plus forte signifie que les traitements pourraient être plus efficaces pour les patients qui ne répondent pas bien aux thérapies actuelles.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques prévoient de développer davantage ces anticorps et de les tester lors d’essais cliniques pour voir s’ils peuvent aider les patients atteints de cancer de manière sûre et efficace. Cela pourrait conduire à de meilleures options d’immunothérapie à l’avenir.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Un nouvel anticorps à quatre bras aide les cellules immunitaires à attaquer le cancer plus puissamment, ouvrant la voie à des traitements améliorés.",

      "summary": "DNA doesn’t just sit still inside our cells — it folds, loops, and rearranges in ways that shape how genes behave. Researchers have now mapped this hidden architecture in unprecedented detail, showing how genome structure changes from cell to cell and over time. These insights reveal why many disease-linked mutations outside genes can still cause harm. The findings could speed up the discovery of genetic risks and inspire new ways to target diseases.",
      "content": "Scientists have created the most detailed maps yet of how human DNA folds, loops, and shifts inside living cells -- revealing a hidden layer of genetic control.\n\nOffers a sweeping new look at how genes interact, fold, and shift position as cells grow, function, and divide\n\nMay speed the discovery of disease causing genetic mutations and uncover hidden mechanisms behind inherited disorders\n\nResearchers hope the tools will eventually reveal how errors in genome folding contribute to cancer, developmental disorders, and other diseases\n\nIn a major step toward understanding how DNA structure shapes human biology, scientists at Northwestern University working with the 4D Nucleome Project have produced the most detailed maps yet of how the human genome is organized in three dimensions and how that organization changes over time. The research, published in Nature, provides a new window into how DNA operates inside living cells.\n\nThe team created these maps using human embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. Together, the data offer a broad look at how genes interact, fold, and shift positions as cells carry out their normal functions and divide, said co-corresponding author Feng Yue, the Duane and Susan Burnham Professor of Molecular Medicine in the department of biochemistry and molecular genetics at Northwestern.\n\n\"Understanding how the genome folds and reorganizes in three dimensions is essential to understanding how cells function,\" Yue said. \"These maps give us an unprecedented view of how genome structure helps regulate gene activity in space and time.\"\n\nDNA Structure Shapes Gene Activity\n\nDNA inside the cell does not exist as a straight, linear strand. Instead, it bends into loops and forms distinct compartments within the cell nucleus. These physical arrangements help control which genes are switched on or off, influencing development, cell identity, and the risk of disease.\n\nTo capture this complexity, Yue and collaborators from around the world combined multiple advanced genomic techniques. By applying these tools to both fibroblasts and human embryonic stem cells, the researchers assembled a unified and highly detailed dataset that captures genome organization from multiple angles.\n\nWhat the New Genome Maps Reveal\n\nThe analysis uncovered several major features of genome architecture:\n\nMore than 140,000 chromatin loops in each cell type, along with the specific elements that anchor those loops and their role in regulating genes\n\nDetailed classifications of chromosomal domains and their positions within the nucleus\n\nHigh-resolution 3D models of entire genomes at the single-cell level, showing how individual genes are arranged relative to nearby genes and regulatory regions\n\nTogether, these findings show that genome structure can vary from one cell to another. The differences are closely tied to essential cellular activities such as transcription and DNA replication.\n\nEvaluating Tools for Studying the 4D Genome\n\nBecause no single experimental method can fully capture the genome's four-dimensional organization, the researchers also compared the strengths and limitations of the technologies used. Through extensive benchmarking, they identified which approaches work best for detecting loops, defining domain boundaries, or spotting subtle changes in how DNA is positioned inside the nucleus -- information that can guide future studies in the field.\n\nThe team also developed computational tools that can predict how a genome will fold based only on its DNA sequence. These tools make it possible to estimate how genetic variants -- including those linked to disease -- might change 3D genome structure without running complex laboratory experiments.\n\nImplications for Disease and Genetic Risk\n\nYue said this capability could speed the identification of disease-causing mutations and uncover biological mechanisms behind inherited disorders that were previously difficult to detect.\n\n\"Since the majority of variants associated with human diseases are located in the non-coding regions of the genome, it is critical to understand how these variants influence essential gene expression and contribute to disease,\" Yue said. \"The 3D genome organization provides a powerful framework for predicting which genes are likely to be affected by these pathogenic variants,\" Yue said.\n\nToward New Diagnostics and Treatments\n\nThe study reinforces a growing view in genetics that reading DNA sequences alone is not enough. The physical shape of the genome also plays a central role. By linking DNA folding, chromatin loops, gene regulation, and cell behavior, the research brings scientists closer to a more complete understanding of how genetic instructions work inside living cells.\n\nLooking ahead, Yue said he hopes these tools will help researchers uncover how errors in genome folding contribute to cancer, developmental disorders, and other diseases, potentially leading to new diagnostic strategies and therapies based on genome structure.\n\n\"Having observed 3D genome alterations across cancers, including leukemia and brain tumors, our next aim is to explore how these structures can be precisely targeted and modulated using drugs such as epigenetic inhibitors,\" Yue said.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – DNA is not just a simple string inside our cells. It folds and loops in complex ways that affect how genes work. Until now, scientists had limited knowledge about these shapes and how they change in different cells.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Northwestern University, working with the 4D Nucleome Project, created the most detailed maps ever showing how human DNA folds and moves inside living cells. They studied two types of cells—human embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts—and used advanced techniques to capture how DNA loops and arranges itself in three dimensions over time.\n\n**Impact** – These maps reveal more than 140,000 loops in each cell type and show how DNA’s 3D shape controls which genes are active. This helps explain why some mutations far from genes can still cause diseases. The research also produced computer tools that predict DNA folding from its sequence, speeding up the search for risky genetic changes linked to illnesses like cancer and inherited disorders.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to use these maps and tools to study how errors in DNA folding lead to diseases such as cancer and developmental problems. They hope this knowledge will lead to new ways to diagnose and treat diseases by targeting the 3D structure of the genome.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – For the first time, scientists have mapped how human DNA folds inside living cells, opening new paths to understand and treat genetic diseases by studying genome shape.\n",
