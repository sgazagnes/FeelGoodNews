      "title": "A hidden temperature law governs all life on Earth",
      "summary": "In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists at Trinity College Dublin have identified a \"universal thermal performance curve\" that governs how all living organisms respond to temperature. This finding reveals that evolution has been unable to escape a single, unifying rule linking performance and heat across every branch of life—from bacteria and plants to reptiles and fish. The curve shows that while organisms perform better as temperatures rise, performance rapidly collapses beyond an optimal point, posing grave risks in a warming world.",
      "content": "Researchers at Trinity College Dublin have uncovered what they call a \"universal thermal performance curve\" (UTPC), a pattern that appears to apply to every living species on Earth. This curve describes how organisms respond to changes in temperature, and it seems to hold true across the entire spectrum of life. According to the scientists, the UTPC effectively \"shackles evolution\" because no species appears capable of escaping its influence on how temperature affects biological performance.\n\nThe Hidden Pattern Linking All Species\n\nTemperature affects every form of life, but the UTPC connects what once seemed to be countless unrelated data sets. It combines tens of thousands of performance curves that describe how efficiently species function at different temperatures. The researchers found that this universal pattern applies not just to all organisms, but also to all kinds of performance metrics -- whether measuring lizards sprinting on a treadmill, sharks swimming in open water, or bacteria dividing under a microscope.\n\nRising Heat and Falling Performance\n\nThe study revealed a consistent trend in how organisms respond to warmth:\n\nPerformance increases gradually as temperature rises until reaching a peak (the optimum point).\n\nBeyond this optimum, performance drops sharply.\n\nWhen temperatures climb too high, overheating can cause physiological breakdown or death.\n\nThese findings, published in the journal PNAS, suggest that species may face greater limits than previously thought when adapting to global climate change. As most regions continue to warm, the window of viable performance for many species could shrink.\n\nOne Curve, Many Temperatures\n\nAndrew Jackson, Professor in Zoology in Trinity's School of Natural Sciences, and co-author,said: \"Across thousands of species and almost all groups of life including bacteria, plants, reptiles, fish and insects, the shape of the curve that describes how performance changes with temperature is very similar. However, different species have very different optimal temperatures, ranging from 5oC to 100oC, and their performance can vary a lot depending on the measure of performance being observed and the species in question.\"\n\n\"That has led to countless variations on models being proposed to explain these differences. What we have shown here is that all the different curves are in fact the same exact curve, just stretched and shifted over different temperatures. And what's more, we have shown that the optimal temperature and the critical maximum temperature at which death occurs are inextricably linked.\"\n\n\"Whatever the species, it simply must have a smaller temperature range at which life is viable once temperatures shift above the optimum.\"\n\nThe Unbreakable Law of Thermal Performance\n\nSenior author, Dr. Nicholas Payne, from Trinity's School of Natural Sciences, added: \"These results have sprung forward from an in-depth analysis of over 2,500 different thermal performance curves, which comprise a tremendous variety of different performance measures for a similarly tremendous variety of different species -- from bacteria to plants, and from lizards to insects.\"\n\n\"This means the pattern holds for species in all major groups that have diverged massively as the tree of life has grown throughout billions of years of evolution. Despite this rich diversity of life, our study shows basically all life forms remain remarkably constrained by this 'rule' on how temperature influences their ability to function. The best evolution has managed is to move this curve around -- life hasn't found a way to deviate from this one very specific thermal performance shape.\"\n\nSearching for the Exceptions\n\n\"The next step is to use this model as something of a benchmark to see if there are any species or systems we can find that may, subtly, break away from this pattern. If we find any, we will be excited to ask why and how they do it -- especially given forecasts of how our climate is likely to keep warming in the next decades.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long studied how temperature affects animals, plants, and other living things, but they thought each species responded differently. Understanding these responses is important as the Earth’s climate changes.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Trinity College Dublin found a single pattern, called the \"universal thermal performance curve\" (UTPC), that explains how all living things react to temperature changes. They looked at over 2,500 examples—from bacteria to reptiles—and saw that performance improves as temperatures rise to a certain point, then quickly falls if it gets too hot.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows that no species can escape this temperature rule. It means that as the world warms, many species might struggle because their best performance happens only within a limited temperature range. This helps scientists better predict how climate change could affect different forms of life.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists want to test if any species break this rule and understand why. Finding exceptions could reveal new ways life adapts to heat, which is important as global temperatures keep rising.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A single temperature rule governs the performance of all living things, shaping how they survive and function as the climate changes.",

      "summary": "The UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) will be held in Belem, Brazil, from November 12-16, with issues like deforestation and financing climate action in developing countries expected to loom large.",
      "content": "Activists from the Brazilian Amazon stand next to an inflatable capybara during a protest calling on COP30 negotiators to protect Amazonian forests, October 2025.\n\nEach COP summit picks a primary theme for the talks to focus on; at COP28 in the United Arab Emirates in 2023, the contentious subject was fossil fuels. After hours of heated debate, the attendees – including representatives of all UN member states – finally reached an agreement calling for “reducing” the use of oil and coal after dropping an initial pledge to “phase out” their use.\n\nThe following year, the COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, was billed as the “finance” conference and ended with a promise to provide $300 billion per year (about €257 billion) by 2035 to help countries in the Global South tackle climate change.\n\nBut no overriding theme has emerged ahead of the COP30. “No single major issue is likely to dominate the debates and negotiations this year. On the contrary, a myriad of very diverse topics will be on the agenda,” says Gaïa Febvre, head of international policy at the Climate Action Network NGO.\n\nTaking stock, 10 years after Paris\n\nCOP30 will also provide an opportunity to take stock 10 years after the landmark Paris Agreement of 2015.\n\nUnder the accord, each country pledged to submit a climate roadmap every five years detailing its strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe collective goal is to keep global warming below the critical threshold of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nRead moreRecord annual rise in atmospheric CO2 levels alarms UN climate body\n\nWhile these emission-reduction roadmaps – or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – were due by the end of September, many countries have yet to submit theirs. The European Union, for example, is deeply divided on the issue and is not expected to submit its contribution until November 4, just a few days before the summit begins.\n\nAs for the conscientious countries who submitted their NDCs on time, even their efforts have fallen short. By mid-October, only Norway and the United Kingdom had submitted NDCs that complied with the Paris Agreement.\n\nConversely, China submitted a roadmap that fell well short of expectations, with a target of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by a very modest 7 to 10 percent by 2035\n\n“We are under no illusions. When these NDCs are reviewed, this COP will conclude that we are not in line with the Paris Agreement,” Febvre says.\n\n\"The big challenge in Belem will therefore be to see how countries respond collectively and politically to this gap in ambitions.”\n\nIn other words, how do world leaders intend to bridge the gap between their current pledges and the need to limit global warming to below 1.5°C?\n\nDespite everything, Febvre notes, “the Paris Agreement is working. Before, we were on track for around +4°C. Since 2015, the curve has flattened and we are now heading for warming of between +2.6° and +2.8°C,” she says.\n\n“But that's not enough to keep our planet habitable. Staying on this trajectory cannot be a viable political strategy.”\n\nRead more‘Overshoot’: As planet crosses 1.5°C global warming limit, can we still reverse course?\n\nEstablishing a roadmap from ‘Baku to Belem’\n\nProviding financial support for developing countries will be back at the centre of discussions. “COP30 will also be a COP on finance, continuing on from Baku,” says Lorelei Limousin, climate campaigner at Greenpeace.\n\nIn Baku, developed countries promised to pay at least $300 billion per year by 2035 to vulnerable nations to help them adapt to the effects of climate change and begin their energy transition. But the agreement was quickly deemed inadequate. The countries concerned were demanding four times the sums proposed and, above all, complained that the terms for implementing the plan were too vague.\n\nIndeed, a year later, uncertainties remain. “We don't know who is going to finance what. Whether it will be public or private funding, whether it will be allocated to mitigation, adaptation, or losses and damages related to climate change. Everything is still very unclear,” says Limousin.\n\n“We now need a real, concrete action plan to move forward,” she adds.\n\nThe effort to scale up financing for developing countries – to at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035 – has been dubbed “From Baku to Belem” at COP30.\n\nAt the same time, discussions will focus on private sources of funding that could supplement the billions that have been pledged. Among the options being considered are “solidarity taxes” on stock and bond transactions, on emissions from fossil fuels or on airline tickets.\n\nHowever, Limousin warns that private funding is unlikely to make up the shortfall. “We cannot rely solely on private finance, because its purpose is to generate money, not save the climate.”\n\n\"Especially since we know where to find the money. By taxing the profits of fossil fuel industries, we could generate €400 billion per year to be repaid in public funding to countries in the Global South,” she says. “This idea has been discussed for several years. It is time for COP30 to send a strong message: The fossil fuel industry must pay for the climate damage it causes.\"\n\nProtecting the forests\n\nBelem, a port city and gateway to the Amazon River, is an ideal venue for Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to shine a spotlight on Brazil's forests while pushing for the creation of a new fund to combat deforestation, the Tropical Forests Forever Facility.\n\n\"The fund would aim to raise $125 billion, which would then be invested in the financial markets. The profits would be paid back to countries with tropical forests in the Amazon, the Congo Basin and Southeast Asia,\" says Clément Helary, forest campaigner at Greenpeace. Brazil has already announced that it will contribute $1 billion, as have China and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n“This is presented as a comprehensive solution to combat forest deforestation and as a means of providing direct funding to indigenous peoples,” says Helary. “But there are still many issues to be discussed. Safeguards are needed on how this money will be reinvested. For example, investments in mining or agribusiness, which contribute to deforestation, must be excluded.”\n\nThe need for action is real. In 2014, an alliance of governments, companies, indigenous peoples and NGOs pledged to halt natural forest loss by 2030 as signatories of the New York Declaration on Forests.\n\nThe goal to curb deforestation was reaffirmed in Glasgow at COP26 in 2021, but the initiative is now stalling.\n\nIn 2024, 8.1 million hectares of forest were lost, according to a study coordinated by the NGO Climate Focus. Primary tropical forests, which are rich in biodiversity and crucial in absorbing and storing carbon, were the most affected, with 6.7 million hectares lost.\n\nMaking this COP a ‘COP of the people’\n\nAfter three previous COPs held in authoritarian countries – Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan – and events disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2025 climate summit must truly be “a COP of the people”, says Fanny Petitbon, France manager of the 350.org renewable energy NGO.\n\n“Belem must be seen as a gateway where the general public can reclaim its freedom of expression,” she says. “This is an opportunity to boost a strong citizen movement and give a voice back to those most vulnerable to the impacts of global warming, particularly indigenous peoples, the poorest populations and women.”\n\nWith this in mind, a concurrent “people's summit” is being organised from November 12-16, with the aim of calling for greater consideration of indigenous peoples’ needs and know-how in the negotiations. There is a walk through the city scheduled for November 15 aimed at mobilising civil society in favour of action on climate change.\n\nRead more🌟The Bright Side: Brazil's Indigenous filmmakers showcase fight for rights\n\n“But it's not just about reclaiming outdoor spaces at the COP,” says Petitbon. For the past year, a coalition of indigenous peoples called “The Answer is Us”, with representatives from across Latin America, has been campaigning to be included in the official negotiating spaces. “They want to be represented in the debates and working groups, and have a voice on an equal footing with the national delegations. They no longer want to be there as mere observers,” says Petitbon.\n\n“It's not about holding a COP for indigenous peoples, but a COP with them,” she concludes.\n\nThis article has been translated from the original in French.",

      "summary": "A group of activists in Sagea village, North Maluku, Indonesia, have successfully pushed back against a nickel mining operation which would destroy spaces sacred to their religion and culture.",
      "content": "This article was submitted as part of the Global Voices Climate Justice fellowship, which pairs journalists from Sinophone and Global Majority countries to investigate the effects of Chinese development projects abroad. Find more stories here.\n\nIndonesian activist Adlunfiqri Sigoro, alongside community residents, workers, Indigenous people, and representatives from other Indonesian environmental organizations, protested in front of Walsin Lihwa Corporation’s (華新麗華股份有限公司) headquarters, a Taiwanese nickel-processing giant, on August 5.\n\nThey were protesting Walsin’s nickel mines in Indonesia, which community residents say harm the environment and threaten locals’ livelihoods, culture, and land. They called for improved labor conditions, transparency of sustainability reports, the establishment of human rights and environmental due diligence policies, phasing out coal, and an effective and proactive stakeholder engagement mechanism.\n\nTaiwanese news outlets covered their protest, highlighting the activists’ journey from Indonesia to Taiwan to protest against the environmental and human rights issues of Walsin Lihwa’s nickel factory.\n\nWalsin Lihwa Corporation has three companies that operate in the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) in Central Sulawesi and the Indonesia Weda Bay Industrial Park (IWIP) in North Maluku. Walsin produces nickel pig iron, a key component for electric vehicles, with a capacity that reaches 300,000 tons each year. Walsin sells its production to several Chinese companies, namely, Shanghai Decent Investment, Guangxi CNGR Energy Science and Technology, and Hunan Zoomwe Zhengyuan Advanced Material Trade.\n\nAfter the protest in Taipei, Adlun and other Indonesian community representatives were invited to an in-person meeting with Walsin’s management. However, as stated in a press release by Indonesia’s Aski Ekologi and Emansipasi Rakyat (AEER) and Taiwan’s Environmental Rights Foundation (ERF), Walsin has failed to provide substantive responses or commitments to activists’ key demands.\n\nAccording to Taiwan Public Television Service, Walsin said in a written statement that some of the information provided by the foundation did not match the facts. The company vows to continue to engage with the foundation, emphasizing that it complies with local regulations in Indonesia. The statement did not directly address specific questions from the public regarding workplace accident liability and pollution data.\n\nA Taiwanese legislator and Indonesian workers of Walsin held a press conference later in the month, calling on Taipei to expedite the enactment of corporate human rights and environmental due diligence legislation. During the press conference, worker representatives revealed the harsh workplace conditions that employees face, according to a report by Taiwan’s Central News Agency. A factory accommodating 1,000 people has only one toilet with no water supply. The manufacturing process produces toxic air and coal dust, but workers are only provided ordinary masks without ample protection, and their rest area lacks an air circulation system.\n\nIn Indonesia, nickel mining and processing environmental and human rights concerns have been in the spotlight for several years after the government’s ambitious plan to expand industrialization. Known as home to the world’s largest nickel reserve, equivalent to 42 percent of the world’s nickel reserves, these resources are scattered mostly in Sulawesi and North Maluku, in the eastern part of Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this industrialization came with high environmental and human rights costs to the community, one of which is in Adlun’s hometown, Sagea, in North Weda, Central Halmahera, North Maluku. Sagea is one of the hotspots for nickel mining and industrialization in Indonesia.\n\nEver since the early stage of nickel exploration, Adlun and his collective, Save Sagea, have taken to the streets countless times to fight for environmental justice for the local community affected by nickel mining and industrialization.\n\nGlobal Voices talked to Adlun about how his collective fought back against the nickel mining concession and the industrial plant in their village for the last decade.\n\nSave Sagea: Preserving the environment and ancestors’ sacred areas\n\nIn 2014, Adlun, alongside several other local youth, founded Save Sagea, a local collective that aims to protect the village from the extractive industry that could destroy their environment and biodiversity.\n\nSave Sagea was formed at the initial stage of nickel exploration by PT First Pacific Mining, a Hong Kong-based investment company. The company planned to build the mining concession above the Bokimoruru karst area, while the planned factory site is located between the Sageyan River and Lake Legaelol. This location is very close to residential areas. Adlun explains the importance of this location for the Sagean community:\n\nSaya perlu menekankan bahwa tiga lokasi ini merupakan tempat-tempat keramat untuk masyarakat kami, merupakan destinasi wisata, dan juga merupakan bagian dari ekosistem karst Halmahera yang membutuhkan perlindungan.\n\nI need to stress that these three locations are sacred locations for our society, prominent tourist attractions, and also part of the karst ecosystem in Halmahera, which deserves protection.\n\nEcologically, the karst area serves as a water catchment and storage area. Economically, the karst tourism of Bokimoruru Cave and Legaelol Lake has benefited the communities of Sagea and Kiya Villages. If the location transforms into nickel mines, residents will lose food independence, such as farming, processing sago, and fishing.\n\nAdlun emphasized the importance of bringing the issue closer to the local communities to create a collective understanding of why they have to oppose the project. In Sagea, traditional and spiritual values are still substantial among locals.\n\nIn this case, organizers localized the issue, emphasizing that the planned mine would destroy their sacred Legaelol lake and Bokimoruru cave — exalted locations where the villagers connect with their ancestors. Locals also conduct cultural rituals, such as pilgrimages, to these locations, and many say they couldn’t bear to have them desecrated by mining. Adlun said:\n\nIsu yang kami bawa adalah tentang menyelamatkan danau dan goa keramat yang sudah diturunkan turun temurun oleh leluhur kami di Sagea. Kami hanya melanjutkan pesan yang disampaikan oleh leluhur kami yang menitipkan tanah ini untuk dijaga kepada kami.\n\nThe issue we are bringing is to save the sacred lake and cave, which have been preserved for generations by the Sagea residents. We are only passing on the message from our ancestors who asked us to protect and maintain this land well.\n\nAside from that, Adlun says that local youth from Sagea opposed the idea of opening nickel mining exploration because the company didn’t consult with or involve the local community in planning the exploration processes. The coalition also demanded that the company conduct a transparent environmental impact analysis, which the company failed to fulfill.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the coalition launched several protests to oppose the establishment of the mining concession and the factory. After several demonstrations, Save Sagea’s representatives were invited to the Deputy Regent of Halmahera’s office to discuss the matter. The project currently remains unoperational.\n\nSince then, Save Sagea has gained more public attention and publicity as it continues fighting to preserve its environment.\n\nThere’s no exact strategy in campaigning for this, says Adlun. Social media and press publications are important; through their campaign on social media, they expanded their network and received much support overseas. But, protests on the street, lobbying, and community organizing are just as essential to strengthen the movement.\n\nFor example, during the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday celebration, a national holiday in Indonesia, residents held a traditional parade, and some of them brought a “Save Sagea” flag to raise awareness against nickel mining, which damages the environment. This is why local youth are a vital part of mobilizing and campaigning.\n\nHowever, Sagea is still facing a threat from nickel mining and industrialization. There are currently five mining licenses seeking to operate in the Sagea karst ecosystem. One of them is Weda Bay Mining, a joint venture between Tsingshan Holding Group Company Limited (青山控股集团有限公司), a leading stainless steel company based in China, Eramet, a mining and metallurgy company based in France, and PT Antam Tbk, an Indonesian state-owned company.\n\nWeda Bay Mining is part of the Indonesia Weda Bay Industrial Park (IWIP), which has started mining operations in the upstream area of ​​the Sagea River. Mining activities near the river have polluted the water and turned the river a brownish, muddy color.\n\nThe Save Sagea coalition will continue pushing the government to designate Sagea’s karst ecosystem as a national geopark and request that mining permits of companies around the river be revoked. Adlun says\n\nKami hanyalah zona yang dikorbankan untuk kepentingan ekstraktif kapitalis, tapi kami akan terus berjuang untuk menyelamatkan Sagea, tanah kami, dan juga lingkungan di sekitar kami.",

      "summary": "New research shows that hippos lived in central Europe tens of thousands of years longer than previously thought. Ancient DNA and radiocarbon dating confirm they survived in Germany’s Upper Rhine Graben during a milder Ice Age phase. Closely related to modern African hippos, they shared the landscape with cold-adapted giants like mammoths. The finding rewrites Ice Age history and suggests regional climates were far more diverse.",
      "content": "Hippos, now found only in sub-Saharan Africa, managed to survive in central Europe far longer than anyone previously believed. A new analysis of ancient bones shows that hippos lived in the Upper Rhine Graben between about 47,000 and 31,000 years ago, during the depths of the last ice age. The findings come from an international research team led by the University of Potsdam and the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen Mannheim in collaboration with the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Archäometrie, and were recently published in Current Biology.\n\nExtinction Timeline Rewritten\n\nUntil recently, scientists thought the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) disappeared from central Europe roughly 115,000 years ago, when the last interglacial period ended. However, the new study -- conducted by researchers from the University of Potsdam, the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen Mannheim, the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Archäometrie Mannheim, ETH Zurich, and several international partners -- reveals that hippos actually persisted in the Upper Rhine Graben of southwestern Germany tens of thousands of years later, well into the middle of the last ice age.\n\nThe Upper Rhine Graben serves as a vital record of ancient climate conditions. Animal bones buried for millennia in layers of gravel and sand offer rare windows into the past. \"It's amazing how well the bones have been preserved. At many skeletal remains it was possible to take samples suitable for analysis -- that is not a given after such a long time,\" said Dr. Ronny Friedrich, a specialist in age determination at the Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Archäometrie.\n\nGenetic and Radiocarbon Clues\n\nResearchers examined numerous hippopotamus fossils using both genetic and radiocarbon dating methods. Ancient DNA sequencing revealed that these Ice Age hippos were closely related to modern African populations and were part of the same species. Radiocarbon dating confirmed their presence during a warmer phase of the middle Weichselian glaciation, when conditions temporarily allowed the animals to survive in central Europe.\n\nFurther genome-wide analysis showed that the European hippo population had extremely low genetic diversity, suggesting it was both small and geographically isolated. Fossil evidence also revealed that these warm-adapted hippos lived alongside cold-climate animals such as mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses -- an unusual ecological mix that highlights the complexity of Ice Age environments.\n\nRethinking Europe's Ice Age Ecosystem\n\n\"The results demonstrate that hippos did not vanish from middle Europe at the end of the last interglacial, as previously assumed,\" summarizes first author Dr. Patrick Arnold. \"Therefore, we should re-analyze other continental European hippo fossils traditionally attributed to the last interglacial period.\"\n\nProf. Dr. Wilfried Rosendahl, general director of the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen Mannheim and project leader of \"Eiszeitfenster Oberrheingraben\" is convinced that ice age research still holds many exciting questions: \"The current study provides important new insights which impressively prove that ice age was not the same everywhere, but local peculiarities taken together form a complex overall picture -- similar to a puzzle. It would now be interesting and important to further examine other heat-loving animal species, attributed so far to the last interglacial.\"\n\nThe research was carried out as part of the \"Eiszeitfenster Oberrheingraben\" project, supported by the Klaus Tschira Stiftung Heidelberg. This interdisciplinary effort aims to shed light on climate and environmental evolution in the Upper Rhine Graben and southwestern Germany over the past 400,000 years. The study focused on Ice Age bones from the Reis collection, housed at the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen, which continue to reveal remarkable insights into Europe's dynamic prehistoric world.",
