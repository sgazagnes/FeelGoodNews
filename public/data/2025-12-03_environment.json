Dr Mya-Rose Craig, 23, nicknamed 'Birdgirl', set up Black2Nature at the age of 13 to connect more children from Visible Minority Ethnic (VME) communities with the outdoors. Reflecting on the charity's 10th anniversary, she said the current environment feels \"very different\"; although there is still \"a lot of progress to be made\". \"It's amazing to look back over the past decade of all the hundreds of kids that we've worked with,\" she said. \"All the different activities, the lives we've changed.\"\n\nDr Craig said that when she first began speaking about the lack of diversity in nature spaces, the reaction was markedly different. \"I remember when I first started having these conversations, people didn't want to have them with me,\" she said. \"It made them very uncomfortable. I think they didn't want to acknowledge that there was exclusion and racism. So much has shifted in the past decade. \"For me, that is really exciting, because I think that is how you build a more sustainable environment, by getting everyone on board.\"\n\nOliver Edwards Photography Dr Craig says she has noticed a shift in the cultural landscape over the past decade\n\nBlack2Nature runs camps, day trips and outdoor adventures designed to increase access for VME children, young people and families. The organisation also campaigns for greater racial diversity in the environmental sector and for equal access to green spaces. Dr Craig, who is from the Chew Valley in Somerset, said the idea to set up the charity came from a \"very deep love of nature and the environment.\" \"I strongly felt that nature was a very important resource for other kids to have access to in terms of mental and physical health,\" she said. \"A lot of these kids have never been to the countryside, so it's about breaking down those assumptions. \"For a lot of kids that we work with, they feel like the countryside is not a space for them.\"\n\nResearch from the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) shows that people from ethnic minorities have an average of 11 times less access to green space than others in society. For parents such as Kumar Sultana, 42, from Bristol, Black2Nature has provided opportunities her family would have otherwise missed. \"I'm a low-income parent and I can't afford things like camping,\" she explained. She added the activities have helped her children connect with the natural world and learn about sustainability.\n\nBlack2Nature Black2Nature runs camps and adventure trips for children\n\nMs Sultana, who has a Pakistani background, said she did not have those experiences growing up. \"We don't have camping in our culture and money is also a barrier to accessing it,\" she said. \"Some of the places we've been, I couldn't afford to take my kids.\"\n\nBlack2Nature The charity campaigns for equal access to green spaces\n\nTo mark its 10th anniversary, the charity will host a conference at the University of the West of England (UWE) on Wednesday, focusing on race equity, education and career pathways in the environmental sector. Looking ahead, Dr Craig said she hopes to see environmental organisations engage more meaningfully with diverse communities and for young people to be made aware of career prospects in that sector. She also wants wider access to nature across the UK. \"I'd love to see better quality of green spaces in cities. There's very often a class divide in terms of green spaces, where nicer neighbourhoods have nicer parks.\"\n\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nThe global push to safeguard oceans is gaining momentum. With the United Nations’ target of protecting thirty percent of the seas by 2030, marine protected areas (MPAs) are being established at a record pace. But a new study from the eastern tropical Pacific sends a cautionary message: without enforcement, protection is just a label.\n\nSurveying seven marine parks from Mexico to Ecuador, researchers found that shark populations are key indicators of healthy ecosystems, and they’re thriving in remote, strictly protected waters. In parks closer to shore, this is certainly not the case, even in areas labeled as protected. This makes it clear that designation alone doesn’t work. Enforcement does.\n\nSharks as health checks for ocean ecosystems\n\nOften called “reef managers,” sharks serve as natural regulators by culling sick prey, keeping populations in balance, and maintaining the integrity of marine food webs. Their presence is a signal of ecosystem health, while their absence is a red flag.\n\nIn the study, published in PLOS One and supported by National Geographic’s Pristine Seas, scientists used baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) to observe where sharks are still thriving. The devices were placed 65 to 80 feet deep, attracting predators with oily bait, and recorded over 100 minutes per deployment.\n\nWhat they saw tells a bigger story.\n\nWhen the label doesn’t match the reality\n\nSharks showed up in droves at offshore sanctuaries like Darwin and Wolf Islands (Galápagos), Malpelo (Colombia), and Clipperton and Revillagigedo (Mexico). These parks are remote and tightly controlled, with no fishing allowed and patrols in place.\n\nBut in Machalilla, Galera-San Francisco, and Caño Island, three coastal MPAs, the results were nearly empty. Across 30 separate deployments in these zones, only four sharks appeared.\n\nEven Caño Island, where fishing is banned, suffers from illegal activity that goes largely unpunished. “It’s easier and cheaper to fish close to shore,” noted Samantha Andrzejaczek, a marine scientist at Stanford who was not involved in the study. Offshore protections are harder to reach, but harder to exploit, too.\n\nAccording to study co-author Enric Sala, only three percent of the ocean is currently protected from fishing. “Marine protected areas that allow fishing do not work,” said Sala, who also leads the Pristine Seas initiative.\n\nProtecting biodiversity and coastal economies\n\nThe problem extends far beyond sharks. One third of fish species are now overfished, unable to replenish their populations fast enough to recover. “It’s like having a checking account where everybody withdraws and nobody makes a deposit,” said Sala. Strictly protected MPAs act like investment accounts: they compound benefits over time.\n\nThose benefits can spill over. When marine reserves are well-managed, fish populations expand beyond their boundaries, supporting nearby fisheries. “Fishers can actually catch more by fishing just outside these zones,” said Andrzejaczek.\n\nAnd the payoffs aren’t just theoretical. Countries like Palau, Gabon, Seychelles, Niue, Colombia, and Chile have already protected at least 30 percent of their waters, and are already starting to see both ecological and economic returns.\n\n“These leaders understood that they need highly protected areas if they want their fishing and coastal economies to have a future,” Sala said.\n\nBuilding real protection, not paper parks\n\nThe study’s clearest message is that marine parks work but only when they are enforced. Remote locations have natural advantages, but it’s not distance alone that determines success. It’s the rules, and whether they’re followed.\n\nMPAs closer to people are not doomed to fail, but they do require more investment in surveillance, governance, and community engagement. “It needs to be properly enforced,” said Andrzejaczek. “Otherwise, it’s not doing its job.”\n\nAs more nations race to meet global conservation targets, this research provides a critical reality check: more protected areas won’t matter if they’re just lines on a map.\n\nTo truly protect sharks, and by extension the oceans they help balance, we need to move from declarations to implementation. It’s not just about reaching 30 percent. It’s about making that 30 percent count.",

Many marine protected areas (MPAs) have been created to help ocean life, especially sharks, but it was unclear if all of these protected areas actually keep sharks safe.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists studied seven marine parks from Mexico to Ecuador using underwater cameras baited to attract sharks. They found that sharks were thriving in remote parks far from shore where fishing is banned and patrols enforce the rules. But in parks near the coast, even those labeled as protected, very few sharks were seen because fishing rules were not properly enforced.\n\n**Impact** – Sharks help keep ocean ecosystems healthy by controlling other fish populations. Their presence shows a balanced ocean environment. The study reveals that simply calling an area “protected” is not enough. Strong enforcement and no fishing rules are needed for sharks and ocean life to recover. This is important because many fish populations are overfished, and healthy marine parks can help fish populations grow, supporting both nature and fishing communities.\n\n**What’s next step** – Countries aiming to meet the UN’s ocean protection goals need to focus on real enforcement, especially in parks close to shore. This means investing in patrols, community support, and monitoring to ensure fishing rules are followed.

Russia can never again use fossil fuel exports as a weapon against Europe. European Parliament had key priorities to accelerating the timeline for banning pipeline gas as much as possible, prohibition on long-term LNG contracts by a full year earlier and prevent the rules from being circumvented. Now, we must act without delay to finalise this agreement and turn our attention to oil imports, where we will take the European Commission at its commitment to advance a legislative proposal early next year” said lead MEP for the Industry, Research and Energy Committee (ITRE), Ville Niinistö (Greens/EFA, Finland).\n\n“Tonight’s agreement sends a clear and powerful message: Europe will never again be dependent on Russian gas. This is a major achievement for the European Union and a historic turning point in European energy policy. We have strengthened the European Commission’s initial proposal by introducing a pathway towards a ban on oil and its products, ending long-term contracts sooner than originally proposed, and secured penalties for non-compliance” said Inese Vaidere (EPP, Latvia), lead MEP for the International Trade Committee.\n\nPress point\n\nThe co-rapporteurs will hold a press point on Wednesday, at 10.30, next to room ANTALL 2Q1, following the presentation of the outcome of the negotiations in the ITRE committee.

The Industry, Research and Energy and the International Trade committees will jointly hold a vote on the provisional agreement on 11 December, ahead of the the full Parliament vote during the 15-18 December plenary session.\n\nBackground\n\nThis legislative proposal is a response to Russia’s systematic weaponisation of energy supplies, a pattern documented over nearly two decades and escalating with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The 2022 invasion came with further deliberate market manipulation, including Gazprom’s unprecedented underfilling of EU storage facilities and abrupt halts to pipelines, causing energy prices to spike by up to eight times their pre-crisis levels.",

This became more serious after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, causing energy prices in Europe to rise sharply.\n\n**What happened** – The European Parliament and the Council have agreed on new rules to stop buying Russian natural gas. Starting in early 2026, Europe will ban imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) bought on the spot market. Imports of Russian pipeline gas will stop by September 30, 2027. The deal also includes penalties for companies that break these rules. Additionally, the European Commission promised to propose a ban on Russian oil imports by early 2026, aiming to have it in place by the end of 2027.\n\n**Impact** – This agreement is important because it helps Europe become less dependent on Russian energy. It also makes it harder for Russia to use gas and oil as political tools. The new rules require companies to prove exactly where their gas comes from, preventing tricks to get around the ban. This marks a big step in Europe’s energy policy and security.\n\n**What's next step** – The agreement must still be officially approved by the full European Parliament and the Council.

      "title": "New research reveals the hidden organism behind Lake Erie’s toxic blooms",
      "summary": "Dolichospermum, a type of cyanobacteria thriving in Lake Erie’s warming waters, has been identified as the surprising culprit behind the lake’s dangerous saxitoxins—some of the most potent natural neurotoxins known. Using advanced genome sequencing, researchers uncovered that only certain strains produce the toxin, and that warmer temperatures and low ammonium levels may tip the ecological balance in their favor.",
      "content": "During the warm months, Lake Erie becomes an ideal setting for cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, to grow rapidly. Under these conditions, the algae can form large blooms that release toxins at levels capable of harming both wildlife and people.\n\nResearchers at the University of Michigan have now pinpointed the organism responsible for producing these toxins. Their work identifies a particular type of cyanobacteria, known as Dolichospermum, as the source.\n\nHarmful algal blooms, or HABs, can consist of many cyanobacterial species, each capable of generating different toxins. Determining which species produces which toxin is important for monitoring, predicting, and managing bloom events.\n\nTracing the Source of Microcystin and Saxitoxin\n\nA major bloom in 2014 generated the toxin microcystin and posed a serious threat to Toledo's drinking water supply. Earlier, in 2007, scientists detected signs of an extremely strong toxin called saxitoxin in Lake Erie, although its biological source remained unknown. Saxitoxins belong to a group of closely related neurotoxins that are considered among the most powerful naturally occurring toxins.\n\n\"The main advantage of knowing which organism produces the toxin is that it helps us understand the conditions that cause toxin production -- that is, what conditions make those organisms successful,\" said Gregory Dick, professor of earth and environmental sciences and of environment and sustainability. \"Such information can help guide policy and management, though we're still a long way from that in this case.\"\n\nUsing DNA Sequencing to Identify the Toxin Producer\n\nTo determine which organism was responsible for saxitoxin, the U-M team collected samples directly from HABs as they appeared in the lake. Lead author Paul Den Uyl applied \"shotgun\" sequencing, a technique that reads all DNA present in a water sample. With these sequences, he reconstructed a complete genome and then searched that genome for the genes involved in making saxitoxin.\n\nTheir analysis revealed several strains of Dolichospermum living in Lake Erie. However, only certain strains carried the ability to produce saxitoxin. While the reason for this difference is not yet clear, the researchers began examining the environmental conditions that may influence toxin production.\n\nEnvironmental Clues in Temperature and Nutrient Levels\n\nThe team collected samples from multiple sites across Lake Erie throughout the year and measured how much of the saxitoxin-related gene appeared in each sample. They often detected higher levels of this gene in warmer water.\n\n\"That is interesting because we do know that the lakes are changing with climate change,\" said Den Uyl, a scientist at U-M's Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, or CIGLR. \"With the warming of the lakes, one of the big questions is, how is that going to change the biological communities, including harmful cyanobacterial blooms?\"\n\nThey also observed that the gene linked to saxitoxin was less common in areas with elevated ammonium levels. The team suspects this pattern may relate to a distinctive characteristic of Dolichospermum: the presence of a gene that suggests it can use nitrogen in the form of dinitrogen, an abundant atmospheric gas. According to Dick, only a limited number of organisms can use nitrogen in this form, giving Dolichospermum a competitive advantage under certain conditions.\n\n\"One of the neat things about having the whole genome is you can see everything the organism can do, at least theoretically,\" said Dick, who is also director of CIGLR. \"You have the whole blueprint for what the organism can do, and we do see the capability of obtaining fixed nitrogen from the water. It's just that getting it in the form of dinitrogen gas is kind of a superpower. Not a lot of organisms can do that, and it makes them more competitive under those conditions.\"\n\nMonitoring Long-Term Risks in a Changing Lake\n\nAccording to the researchers, they have monitored saxitoxin in the lake for nine years, but this span is too short to determine whether toxin levels will rise as the climate continues to warm.\n\n\"But now that we know who's producing it, I think we can keep a better watch on these organisms and we can also directly assess the gene abundance over time,\" Dick said. \"We plan to continue monitoring the abundance of this organism, but it's too early to tell if it's becoming more abundant. It's just a correlation, but that correlation with temperature is concerning.\"\n\nTheir study appears in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.",
