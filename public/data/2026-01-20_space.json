      "title": "Inside the mysterious collapse of dark matter halos",
      "summary": "Physicists have unveiled a new way to simulate a mysterious form of dark matter that can collide with itself but not with normal matter. This self-interacting dark matter may trigger a dramatic collapse inside dark matter halos, heating and densifying their cores in surprising ways. Until now, this crucial middle ground of behavior was nearly impossible to model accurately. The new code makes these simulations faster, more precise, and accessible enough to run on a laptop.",
      "content": "For nearly 100 years, dark matter has remained one of the biggest unanswered questions in cosmology. Although it cannot be seen directly, its gravitational influence shapes galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. At the Perimeter Institute, two physicists are investigating how a particular form of dark matter, known as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), may influence the way cosmic structures grow and change over time.\n\nIn research published in Physical Review Letters, James Gurian and Simon May introduce a new computational tool designed to study how SIDM affects galaxy formation. Their approach makes it possible to explore types of particle interactions that were previously difficult or impractical to model accurately.\n\nWhen Dark Matter Interacts With Itself\n\nSIDM is a theoretical form of dark matter whose particles can collide with one another but do not interact with baryonic matter, the familiar matter made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. These collisions conserve energy through what physicists call elastic self-interactions. This behavior can strongly influence dark matter halos, the massive concentrations of dark matter that surround galaxies and help guide their evolution.\n\n\"Dark matter forms relatively diffuse clumps which are still much denser than the average density of the universe,\" says Gurian, a Perimeter postdoctoral fellow and co-author of the study. \"The Milky Way and other galaxies live in these dark matter halos.\"\n\nHeat, Energy Flow, and Core Collapse\n\nThe self-interacting nature of SIDM can trigger a process known as gravothermal collapse within dark matter halos. This phenomenon arises from a counterintuitive property of gravity, where systems bound by gravity become hotter as they lose energy rather than cooling down.\n\n\"You have this self-interacting dark matter which transports energy, and it tends to transport energy outwards in these halos,\" says Gurian. \"This leads to the inner core getting really hot and dense as energy is transported outwards.\" Over time, this process can drive the core of the halo toward a dramatic collapse.\n\nA Missing Link in Dark Matter Modeling\n\nSimulating the structures formed by SIDM has long been a challenge. Existing methods work well only under certain conditions. Some simulations perform best when dark matter is sparse and collisions are rare, while others are effective only when dark matter is extremely dense and interactions are frequent.\n\n\"One approach is an N-body simulation approach that works really well when dark matter is not very dense and collisions are infrequent. The other approach is a fluid approach -- and this works when dark matter is very dense and collisions are frequent.\"\n\n\"But for the in-between, there wasn't a good method,\" Gurian says. \"You need an intermediate range approach to correctly go between the low-density and high-density parts. That was the origin of this project.\"\n\nA Faster and More Accessible Simulation Tool\n\nTo solve this problem, Gurian and his co-author Simon May, a former Perimeter postdoctoral researcher now serving as an ERC Preparative Fellow at Bielefeld University, developed a new code called KISS-SIDM. The software bridges the gap between existing simulation methods, delivering higher accuracy while requiring far less computing power. It is also publicly available for other researchers.\n\n\"Before, if you wanted to check different parameters for self-interacting dark matter, you needed to either use this really simplified fluid model, or go to a cluster, which is computationally expensive. This code is faster, and you can run it on your laptop,\" says Gurian.\n\nOpening the Door to New Dark Matter Physics\n\nInterest in interacting dark matter has grown in recent years, partly due to puzzling features seen in galaxies that may not fit standard models.\n\n\"There has been considerable interest recently in interacting dark matter models, due to possible anomalies detected in observations of galaxies that may require new physics in the dark sector,\" says Neal Dalal, a member of the Perimeter Institute research faculty.\n\n\"Previously, it was not possible to perform accurate calculations of cosmic structure formation in these sorts of models, but the method developed by James and Simon provides a solution that finally allows us to simulate the evolution of dark matter in models with significant interactions,\" Dalal says. \"Their paper should enable a broad spectrum of studies that previously were intractable.\"\n\nImplications for Black Holes and Beyond\n\nThe collapse of dark matter cores is especially intriguing because it may leave observable signatures, including possible connections to black hole formation. However, how this process ultimately ends remains an open question.\n\n\"The fundamental question is, what's the final endpoint of this collapse? That's what we'd really like to do -- study the phase after you form a black hole.\"\n\nBy making it possible to explore these extreme conditions in detail, the new code represents an important step toward answering some of the deepest questions about dark matter and the structure of the universe.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Dark matter is an invisible substance that makes up most of the matter in the universe. It shapes galaxies and cosmic structures by its gravity, but scientists do not fully understand how it behaves. One idea is that dark matter particles can sometimes collide with each other, a type called self-interacting dark matter (SIDM).\n\n**What happened** – Two physicists, James Gurian and Simon May, created a new computer program called KISS-SIDM that can simulate how SIDM affects the formation and change of galaxies. This program works faster and more accurately than older methods and can even run on a regular laptop. It fills a gap in previous models that could only handle very rare or very frequent dark matter collisions, but not the middle range.\n\n**Impact** – This new tool helps scientists understand a strange process where the center of dark matter clumps, called halos, can heat up and collapse in surprising ways. This process might be linked to how black holes form. Because the program is easier to use and open to everyone, many researchers can now study these cosmic mysteries more deeply.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will use this simulation to explore what happens after the dark matter core collapses, including if and how black holes emerge.

      "content": "It is theoretically possible for a particularly massive star to collapse in on itself to form a black hole rather than exploding in a supernova, and we might now have seen the process in action\n\nAn illustration of a failed supernova forming a black hole NASA, ESA, and P. Jeffries (STScI)\n\nA massive star in a nearby galaxy that reached the end of its life appears to have vanished rather than blown up, forming a black hole in what astronomers think is a rare way.\n\nThe most common black holes in our galaxy begin as stars. When these stars explode in a supernova, they can leave behind a black hole. But it is thought that black holes can also form from stars that fail to go supernova, instead simply collapsing under their own mass and producing a black hole directly.\n\nIn 2024, Kishalay De at Columbia University in New York and his colleagues observed an unusually bright star called M31-2014-DS1 in the nearby galaxy Andromeda that was around 20 times as massive as our sun. The star appeared to grow briefly brighter in 2014, before becoming dramatically dimmer between 2017 and 2020. De and his colleagues thought this pattern of brightening and then fading matched predictions for a failed supernova producing a black hole, but there was no sign of the black hole itself, such as tell-tale X-ray radiation.\n\nNow, De and his team have observed M31-2014-DS1 with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, finding a faint, red object where the star once was that is only around 8 per cent as bright as the original star and is shrouded in a cocoon of dust moving rapidly outwards. This fits with what astronomers think a failed supernova making a black hole would look like. De and his team declined to comment for this story because their research hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet.\n\nIn a separate study analysing the same JWST data, Emma Beasor at Liverpool John Moores University, UK, and her colleagues found that the case for M31-2014-DS1 undergoing a failed supernova that produced a black hole was murkier, and that the observations could just as easily be the result of two stars merging, which would also produce a small outburst followed by a dimming and lots of dust.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“The predictions for what a failed supernova looks like overlap quite significantly with what we might expect from two stars colliding and producing loads of dust,” says Beasor.\n\nHowever, both scenarios would still be exotic phenomena, she says. “We don’t see stars that fade this significantly very often.”\n\n“In either explanation, this is exciting. The visible star really has gone away,” says Gerard Gilmore at the University of Cambridge. “For many years, searches for disappearing massive stars led to ambiguous results. Now, the full power of multi-wavelength time-domain astronomy is on show and making progress.”\n\nThe only surefire way to say whether a black hole has been formed is to identify X-ray radiation, says Gilmore, which can’t currently be seen at the location of M31-2014-DS1. However, being able to study the aftermath of a dimmed star with a powerful telescope like JWST will allow us to find out what happened, he says. “We are on the verge of discovering at least one of the final fates of massive stars, an amusingly Cheshire cat way to go.”\n\nReferences: arXiv, DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2601.0577 and DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2601.05317",
