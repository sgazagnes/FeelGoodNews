      "content": "Children in Need 2025 raises more than £45m\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Annabel Rackham and Emaan Warraich Share Save\n\nWatch all the best moments from Children in Need 2025\n\nThe 2025 Children in Need appeal has raised more than £45m to help children and young people across the UK - with the total likely to raise even further. Hosts Paddy McGuinness, Mel Giedroyc, Lenny Rush, Rochelle Humes, Vernon Kay and Big Zuu fronted the annual fundraising show on BBC One on Friday night, live from Salford. There were sketches involving stars from Gladiators and The Apprentice, as well as a performance from some of the Strictly Come Dancing professionals. Other acts included Lewis Capaldi, McFly's Tom Fletcher and his son Buzz, and Eurovision contestants Remember Monday.\n\nThe total announced at the end of the three-hour show was £45,507,536 - more than £9.5m of which was raised by Sara Cox for her 135-mile challenge. The Radio 2 DJ took part in five marathons in five days - running, jogging and walking through northern England, ending - aptly - in the town of Pudsey. Speaking to fellow Radio 2 DJ Scott Mills at the finish line on Friday afternoon, Cox said: \"It's just been the maddest, most painful, wonderful thing I've ever, ever done.\" \"I've never had shapely calves in my life,\" she joked, \"But I have now because they are so swollen, it looks like I've been hit with a bat.\" She said during the appeal show: \"It was like a rollercoaster... literally my mood was changing every three, four, seconds - it was a lot.\" Cox told the hosts she was \"absolutely exhausted\" but that it had been \"the most amazing, painful and wonderful few days of my life\".\n\nMoment Sara Cox crosses finish line after 135-mile charity run\n\nDuring The Apprentice skit, the script was flipped on Lord Sugar as he found himself on the receiving end of an intense boardroom grilling. The entrepreneur explained that he \"owed a favour to Pudsey\" and that was why he allowed eight children to ask questions like: \"Why is your name Lord Sugar when you are so salty all the time?\" \"Well Sugar is my name and that's it, what can I say?\" he replied.\n\nPudsey Bear - the yellow bear who acts as a Children in Need mascot - and actor Rush, 16, could be seen embarking on new BBC roles as \"TV big cheeses\" in another sketch. It showed a children's takeover that aimed to put children at the heart of all BBC programming. Rush, who wore a BBC lanyard and suit, said: \"You're always going to face resistance. But remember, who runs the world? I do. Well, kids do.\" In another clip, Richard Madeley threatened to sack Rush, saying: \"We both know what's going to happen if things don't improve, don't we? Lenny is going to be fired.\"\n\nPudsey Bear and actor Lenny Rush became the new BBC bosses\n\nFriday night's show reimagined Gladiators - with the team of elite athletes replaced by children. The so-called \"mini Gladiators\" went head-to-head with contestants in a range of tasks, but there was one small snag - they were simply too tiny to take on many of the challenges properly. The live programme also saw Giedroyc and Big Zuu led in a live workout by fitness expert Joe Wicks, which also featured some of Strictly's professional dancers. Earlier in the week Big Zuu collaborated with Pudsey Bear and a group of children from a theatre project, funded by Children in Need, to present his first CBeebies Bedtime Story. He read Basil Dreams Big by Lu Fraser and Sarah Warburton, a story about resilience, bravery, and believing in yourself. It was broadcast on Thursday night and is available to stream on BBC iPlayer.\n\nPudsey has also taken part in a special edition of Bargain Hunt",

As part of the ILO process, governments, workers, and employers are submitting comments on the draft ahead of final negotiations in 2026.“This is a historic opportunity to make sure technology and the economy work for workers, not against them,” said Lena Simet, senior economic justice researcher at Human Rights Watch. “At the ILO, governments, employers, and workers are writing the rules together, and those rules should protect the people doing the work, not the corporations that shift costs and risks onto their workers.”The ILO estimates that platform work has nearly doubled in recent years, and the World Bank estimates that up to 400 million people now earn income through these businesses. These companies promise their workers freedom and flexibility, but in reality, undermine their rights. Around the world, platform companies misclassify workers as self-employed, evading legal obligations for minimum wages, safety, and social security.

Existing international law does not provide guidance on algorithmic management in the workplace, leaving a major gap in securing protections for workers’ rights. The Human Rights Watch briefing complements a joint submission with nine civil society organizations outlining concrete proposals to ensure the treaty delivers on its promise of decent work for all platform workers. Human Rights Watch’s recommendations build on findings from a report the organization released earlier in 2025, which documented that platform workers across the US are being denied their human rights, including with pay below the minimum wage, unsafe working conditions, and the use of opaque and unaccountable algorithms to evade employer responsibilities.Human Rights Watch recommends that the treaty treat platform workers as employees unless a company can prove genuine independence, ensuring workers are not wrongly classified as self-employed and denied labor rights protections. At the same time, it should make clear that all individuals working for these companies, regardless of contractual status, are entitled to the treaty’s protections.The treaty should guarantee workers’ rights to safe and healthy working conditions by requiring companies to mitigate work-related risks and algorithm-driven pressure that pushes workers to work faster or longer. It should also ensure fair wages for all working time, including waiting periods, and require companies to cover the work-related expenses and social security contributions that traditional employers pay.Stronger safeguards are also needed for algorithmic management. The treaty should require transparency about how automated systems affect all aspects of work, including pay and access to jobs, and ensure meaningful human review and appeal for automated decisions.

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nBuilding new foundations\n\nWelcome to the third installment of The Optimist Daily’s Annual Local Changemakers series. Over five weeks, we’re celebrating ten extraordinary individuals and organizations transforming their communities through heart-led innovation. This week, we’re spotlighting changemakers who are rebuilding, physically and culturally, what has been lost, overlooked, or shut out.\n\nToday, we head to Phoenix and beyond, where the media-lifestyle brand Move Over Bob is breaking new ground in a field too long dominated by one voice by making loud room for many more.\n\nWhen the story changes, the world changes\n\nWhen co-founders Kate Glantz and Angie Cacace launched Move Over Bob, they weren’t just starting a magazine. They were igniting a movement.\n\n“For too long, construction culture has centered around one story and one image of who belongs,” the brand’s Who We Are page explains. Today, women make up less than five percent of workers in some trade roles. This is not because they lack the skill or drive, but because they’ve rarely been shown that they belong. After all, how can a girl aspire to be a construction worker if she’s never seen someone like her holding the tools?\n\n“Move Over Bob is about so much more than construction,” says Kate Glantz, co-founder and CEO. “It’s an anthem and a blueprint for women to build a full, prosperous life—and to have the (power) tools to do it on their terms.”\n\nWhat began as a bold idea to print a youth-friendly trades magazine has now expanded to reach thousands of girls and young women through classrooms, libraries, youth programs, and community events. In its first year alone, 20,000 magazines were distributed across more than 400 Arizona middle and high schools, correctional facilities, nonprofits, and community centers, completely free.\n\nMeeting the gap with tools and stories\n\nThe problem is well documented: The U.S. is facing a skilled labor shortage, with nearly two million construction jobs expected to go unfilled by 2031. But Move Over Bob saw more than a workforce issue. It saw a visibility issue.\n\n“If a girl has never seen a female plumber, or electrician, or welder, or crane operator, how do we expect her to become one?” asks the Move Over Bob team.\n\nThat insight drives their strategy.\n\nA lifestyle-forward print magazine blending role-model interviews, real-world training tips, and fashion-meets-function spreads.\n\nQR-coded multimedia guides linking readers to apprenticeships, scholarships, and local training programs.\n\nRepresentation at scale with contributors and stories from across experience levels, cultures, and trades.\n\n“Build with Us”, an invitation for women in trades to share their stories, mentor, and speak at events.\n\nReal tools, real talk\n\nOne recent highlight that Kate Glantz shared with The Optimist Daily was the winter 2026 cover shoot featuring three women welders from different backgrounds and styles, all showing up unapologetically. “I am certain thousands of our readers will find something of themselves in these role models,” Kate said. “It was the perfect combination of inspo and real talk.”\n\nA cultural shift, not a career brochure\n\nUnlike traditional outreach campaigns that focus solely on labor stats, Move Over Bob is building something more fundamental: a sense of belonging. They’re showing up in spaces where girls can imagine futures on their terms, in their voices.\n\nAs first-year electrical apprentice Solei Donahue shared in an early issue:\n\n“Move Over Bob matters because it’s inspiring the next generation of girls to do things they were taught they couldn’t do.”\n\nAnd it’s working. The magazine is now expanding beyond Arizona, with national subscribers and growing demand from schools, families, and workforce programs in other states.\n\nWhy Move Over Bob matters\n\nRepresentation meets access:\n\nBy making tradeswomen visible and linking readers directly to opportunities, Move Over Bob turns inspiration into tangible action.\n\nCulture change over tokenism:\n\nThis isn’t a “women can do it too” side note. It’s a redesign of the story from the inside out with men as allies and women leading the way.\n\nNarrative as infrastructure:\n\nThe helmet, the tool belt, the ladder. These are all symbols. But so is the magazine, the quote, the cover story. Move Over Bob is building both.\n\nThe next job site: everywhere\n\nKate Glantz says the mission is clear: scale nationally, while staying rooted in local ecosystems. “We now have subscribers all over the country… we just need to start meeting them where labor codes and training systems are local.”\n\nThe magazine’s free distribution model remains central to their equity strategy, and partnerships with training programs and schools continue to grow.\n\nWhere others see a labor gap, Move Over Bob sees a leadership opening. And they’re handing young women the mic and the toolbox to fill it.\n\nHungry for more?\n\nGo to the Move Over Bob site to learn more about their work, grab a copy of the debut magazine, and discover their merch.\n\nFollow them on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook for the latest updates.",

Cela vient souvent du fait que les filles voient rarement des femmes dans ces rôles, ce qui rend difficile d’imaginer leur avenir dans ces carrières.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Move Over Bob est une nouvelle marque médiatique lancée par Kate Glantz et Angie Cacace à Phoenix. Ce qui a commencé comme un magazine pour les jeunes est vite devenu un mouvement. Le magazine partage des histoires de femmes dans les métiers, donne des conseils pratiques et met en lien avec des apprentissages et des bourses.\n\n**Impact** – En un an, Move Over Bob a distribué 20 000 magazines gratuits dans plus de 400 écoles, centres communautaires et programmes jeunesse en Arizona. Cela permet aux filles de voir des modèles qui leur ressemblent et montre que les métiers sont un endroit où les femmes peuvent prendre la tête. Cette approche dépasse les chiffres pour créer un vrai sentiment d’appartenance.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – La marque prévoit de s’étendre à l’échelle nationale tout en gardant des partenariats locaux forts. Elle veut toucher plus de filles dans tout le pays avec des magazines gratuits et des liens vers des formations locales. Leur but est de changer la culture des métiers pour que les femmes ne se contentent pas de rejoindre le secteur, mais en deviennent leaders.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Move Over Bob change le récit dans les métiers spécialisés en inspirant et soutenant les filles pour qu’elles deviennent les futures leaders de secteurs où les femmes sont rares.\n",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In 2023, Indigenous communities in Ecuador held a referendum to stop oil drilling in Yasuni National Park, a large and important rainforest in the Amazon. This vote was a major step to protect their land and the environment.\n\n**What happened** – On August 20, 2025, Waorani Indigenous leaders gathered in Quito, Ecuador’s capital, to protest in front of the Constitutional Court. They demanded that the court enforce the results of the referendum, which legally bans oil companies from drilling in the protected area.\n\n**Impact** – This action shows Indigenous people taking a strong stand to protect their land and rights. It also helps preserve one of the most biodiverse places on Earth, which is important for wildlife and climate. The case highlights how Indigenous voices can influence national laws and environmental decisions.\n\n**What's next step** – The Constitutional Court will review the case and decide whether to fully enforce the referendum. If enforced, it could stop future oil exploration in Yasuni and inspire other countries to respect Indigenous votes on environmental issues.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Indigenous leaders in Ecuador are actively working to make sure a vote to protect their Amazon land from oil drilling is respected by the courts.",

Elle aide aussi à préserver l’un des endroits les plus riches en biodiversité au monde, important pour la faune et le climat. Ce cas montre comment les voix autochtones peuvent influencer les lois nationales et les décisions environnementales.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – La Cour constitutionnelle va examiner le dossier et décider si elle applique pleinement le référendum.
