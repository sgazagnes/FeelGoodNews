      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nExploring the beauty of America’s national parks should be something everyone can enjoy. But for millions of disabled visitors, that promise of adventure often falls short. Now, Rocky Mountain National Park is making powerful strides to change that.\n\nDespite budget cuts within the National Park Service (NPS), a growing number of parks are adding adaptive equipment and mobility tools to help more people experience the outdoors. As of now, around 28 national park sites offer such tools. Among the latest to expand its offerings is Colorado’s popular Rocky Mountain National Park, which just rolled out new upgrades aimed at making the landscape more accessible than ever before.\n\nExpanding access with mobility in mind\n\nThanks to support from the Rocky Mountain Conservancy, the park’s nonprofit arm, several new accessibility initiatives have come to life. These include a new wheelchair-accessible Field Institute bus, upgraded accessible picnic tables, and an expanded fleet of all-terrain wheelchairs available to visitors at no cost.\n\nThe Accessible Field Institute Bus includes space for two wheelchairs, a lift, and 12 standard seats, allowing a group of 15 to ride and learn about the park’s native flora, fauna, and geology. “We’ve long dreamed of having a wheelchair accessible bus for our Field Institute,” the Conservancy shared in a recent newsletter, crediting a grant from the R.C. Kemper Charitable Trust and Foundation for making it possible.\n\nBig improvements made possible through community support\n\nOther upgrades include accessible picnic tables to replace 130 aging units across the park. These new concrete tables comply with modern accessibility standards and are built to last longer, helping ensure that campgrounds and day-use areas are more welcoming.\n\nPerhaps most exciting for adventurers: three new GRIT all-terrain wheelchairs have joined the park’s equipment fleet. Visitors can borrow them for free via the Estes Park Mountain Shop to explore both the park and the nearby Estes Park area.\n\n“The people who rent GRIT wheelchairs are able to experience Rocky in a way that would not be possible without them,” said Zach Zehr, owner of the shop. “Adding these additional chairs more than doubled our fleet, and my hope is we always have a chair available to rent in the future.”\n\nFrom snowy trails to picnic tables: inclusion in action\n\nRocky Mountain National Park’s efforts don’t stop at hiking trails. The park recently added a wheelchair sledge to its educational programming. Designed for snowy terrain, the sledge allows students to stay in their own wheelchairs while safely navigating snow-covered ground. It includes skis, a brake, and adjustable supports for better control.\n\nThe sledge was successfully used on Conservancy-funded snowshoe field trips this past winter, showing that learning and exploring the outdoors doesn’t need to stop with the seasons.\n\nA long-term vision for an accessible outdoors\n\nLooking ahead, Rocky Mountain National Park is developing a comprehensive accessibility guide, which will help visitors plan their trip with confidence. Expected in 2026, the guide will include park information, amenities, and location details tailored to the needs of disabled visitors. It will be available in braille, large-print, PDF, print, and audio formats with written transcripts.\n\nOne of the park’s most passionate advocates is Quinn Brett, a former climbing ranger who became paralyzed after a fall in 2017. “After I was injured… I returned to the National Park Service in a unique role. I’ve been educating on the type of mobility devices out there, opening doors for us to explore,” she wrote for Outside magazine in 2023.\n\nToday, Brett sees how her home park is stepping up. “Realizing that there’s a lot of places in our national parks—the opportunities we’re providing are not really widespread,” she told Denver’s 9News.\n\nBut Brett remains determined. “I’m gonna be an advocate louder than I can be for people with disabilities recreating in our national parks and in our public lands… Let’s amp it up, man. We got places to go, things to do.”\n\nFor the Rocky Mountain Conservancy, that kind of energy is exactly what fuels their work. “Our job is to steward the park for everyone,” said communications manager Kaci Yoh. “Forever.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many people with disabilities find it hard to explore national parks because trails and facilities are often not designed for their needs. Rocky Mountain National Park is working to change this by making its outdoor spaces easier to enjoy for everyone.\n\n**What happened** – The park has added new features like a wheelchair-accessible bus, upgraded picnic tables that everyone can use, and special all-terrain wheelchairs that visitors can borrow for free. These changes were made possible with help from the Rocky Mountain Conservancy and donations from groups like the R.C. Kemper Charitable Trust. They also introduced a wheelchair sledge to help people move safely on snowy trails.\n\n**Impact** – These improvements mean that people using wheelchairs or with limited mobility can now explore more parts of the park, join educational trips, and enjoy outdoor activities that were harder to access before. For example, the new bus can carry 15 people, including two in wheelchairs, making group visits easier. The all-terrain wheelchairs let visitors navigate rough ground, opening up more areas to explore.\n\n**What's next step** – By 2026, the park plans to publish a full accessibility guide. This guide will help visitors with disabilities plan their trips by providing detailed information about accessible trails, facilities, and services. It will be offered in formats like braille and audio to reach more people.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Rocky Mountain National Park is actively improving access and services to ensure visitors with disabilities can fully enjoy its natural beauty and activities.\n",

      "content": "Brothers set new record for 9,000-mile Pacific row\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Steven McKenzie BBC Scotland News Share Save\n\nThe MacLean Brothers The brothers celebrated their arrival in Cairns with flares\n\nThree brothers from Edinburgh have claimed a new record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean after 140 days at sea. Jamie, Ewan and Lachlan MacLean endured violent tropical storms, which forced them into making lengthy detours on their 9,000-mile (14,484km) journey from Peru to Australia. During one storm, Lachlan was swept overboard by a large wave before being pulled back into the boat. The brothers, who have been reunited with their family and friends in Cairns, in eastern Australia, said they were looking forward to pizza - and a decent night's sleep.\n\nThe MacLean brothers The brothers started their challenge four and a half months ago\n\nHigh winds\n\nThe Scots have beaten the previous record of 162 days for the fastest full, unassisted, non-stop Pacific row, set by Russian solo rower Fyodor Konyukhov in 2014. The MacLeans completed their row in their boat, Rose Emily, named in memory of their unborn sister. The brothers, who have so far raised more than £700,000 of a £1m target for clean water projects in Madagascar, had hoped to complete their journey in an even quicker time. \"We left just with a dream to get across this ocean and raise as much money as we can... and it's just been absolutely insane, all of the support,\" Ewan said in an Instagram post that was published as their boat approached Cairns. But bad weather hampered the final stretch of their journey, including high winds overnight on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWatch: Lachlan MacLean talks about the challenges of rowing the Pacific Ocean\n\nLachlan, speaking to BBC Scotland News on Thursday, said: \"The main thing on all our minds, aside from seeing family and our girlfriends, is a freshly made bed with fresh linen sheets - and a shower.\" He said the row had been going relatively smoothly before the conditions became more challenging about half way across the ocean. Lachlan said: \"Up until then we had pretty consistent wind and weather. \"Then we had an anti-cyclone we couldn't avoid.\" During the 36-hour storm in July, Lachlan was washed overboard. The 27-year-old said he was lucky to be attached to the boat by a safety line during 40mph (64km/h) winds and 6m (20ft) waves. He was dragged along behind the craft before Ewan, 33, was able to help him to scramble back on board. Later, a cyclone forced the brothers to abandon a plan to land in Brisbane and they were forced to take a detour around the remote New Caledonia archipelago to avoid the storm.\n\nThe MacLean brothers Lachlan survived being swept overboard during a storm\n\nTo complete the row unsupported, they could not land on an island to resupply, or accept help from any passing boats. The brothers had to bring with them all their food - 500kg of freeze-dried food and 75kg of oats. They had enough provisions to last 150 days, but Lachlan said they started rationing their supplies in the final few weeks just in case of further delays in reaching Australia. Lachlan said: \"We still had a reserve of military rations, but we didn't want to tuck into them. \"They were there for an emergency, and they also don't taste very good.\" He said the \"final resort\" if they ran out of all their supplies was a fishing rod they had brought with them to catch their own food.\n\nThe MacLean brothers The brothers managed snatches of rest between long shifts at the oars\n\nMorale was a key concern for the rowers, with sleep deprivation one of the biggest challenges. The brothers, who completed a record-breaking rowed across the Atlantic in 2020, tried to get at least five or six hours of sleep in blocks of up to three hours around long shifts at the oars. Sharing a chocolate bar, or making each other a coffee, helped to raise their spirits. Lachlan said: \"Our super power is being brothers. \"You can be totally frank with each other and we obviously have so much shared history, and that maybe means you are less likely to fall out.\" He said their primary motivation was the fundraising, and Lachlan thanked those who had donated. He said: \"We're absolutely blown away by how it has gone.\"\n\nThe MacLean brothers The brothers said they were looking forward to fresh food and a good sleep\n\nWhile looking forward to fresh food and a comfy bed, Lachlan said he would miss nights under star-filled skies and close encounters with whales, dolphins and sea birds. Jamie, 32, described the adventure as \"the most incredible, relentless and often surreal\" of his life. He said: \"While I might miss the routine, the solitude, the sunsets, and sunrises and so much more, right now I'm just very glad to be back on land with my friends and family who I've missed so much. \"The whole thing will take a while to sink in.\" He added: \"This won't surprise anybody – but all I want is a pizza. \"Things got tough towards the end and we seriously thought we might run out of food. \"Despite how exhausted we were, we had to step up a gear and make it before supplies ran out, but now we get to eat proper food. Ewan added: \"The days have been long and yet the weeks have flown past, it's strange to think of the time that we've spent out here. \"This has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and I couldn't have even contemplated it without my brothers.\"",

      "content": "The professional-networking site LinkedIn can be useful for finding like-minded people around the globe.Credit: Yalcin Sonat/Alamy\n\nWhen I started my PhD in 2018, I thought LinkedIn was for only business people — dry, corporate and dominated by people bragging about their latest achievement. I couldn’t imagine spending time on it. But by the end of my PhD in 2023, the networking site had opened doors I didn’t even know existed. So what changed?\n\nDuring my doctorate at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, I helped to organize careers events for PhD students, inviting speakers who had transitioned into jobs outside academia.\n\nI did this because I had seen so many brilliant scientists leave academia not because they weren’t good enough, but because they were exhausted or felt unsupported. But when they tried to leave, there was no guidance or roadmap.\n\nI realized that, if I cared so much about this issue, maybe I should do something about it, so I founded a company to provide a better support system.\n\nBuilding a company means building connections, and I had been told repeatedly: ‘Without a network, you won’t get anywhere.’ So I started looking for one — and that’s how I ended up on LinkedIn.\n\nIt felt a little scary at first — a global platform with one billion users, but with an open structure in which technically anyone can interact with anyone. I started using LinkedIn to find other company founders and like-minded people. One of these was Angela Priest, a hiring manager with two decades of experience building high-performing teams in industry. We met online and both knew right away that we were a great match. We shared professional values, drive and a deep desire to make things better.\n\nWe co-founded Alma.Me in 2024. Our mission is to provide early-career researchers with the tools and knowledge they need to quickly land a job in industry. We do this mainly through suggesting improvements to industry CVs, interview preparation and one-to-one coaching, guiding PhD graduates on how to effectively market themselves to a business audience.\n\nFounding Alma.Me opened the next door. It brought me back to the Karolinska Institute and to its head of doctoral education, Robert (Bob) Harris, who had placed my doctor’s hat on my head during the PhD graduation ceremony six months earlier — a monumental moment for me. I remember thinking: ‘This is the man I need to talk to.’ He’s in charge of doctoral education, so I knew I needed to get him to understand how important career preparation is for new graduates.\n\nBut how do you reach someone like him once you’ve left the university? The answer was through LinkedIn. I started by commenting on a few of his posts, and eventually suggested meeting up for a chat over coffee.\n\nThat conversation changed everything. Bob agreed with Alma.Me’s mission. He truly cares about students. Thanks to him, Alma.Me now offers a career-development course — accredited by the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System —at the Karolinska, something I had never imagined would be possible.\n\nAt that point, I had already achieved some important goals: launching a business with Angela, providing services to help PhD students to transition into careers and getting our course included at a prominent medical university.\n\nBut I didn’t stop there. Bob and I shared a vision for something bigger. Career development was one piece of the puzzle, but we both knew there was more to improve. The question was: how can one or two voices make a difference? We imagined a global collective of people who wanted to rethink the academic ecosystem. So we turned to our networks — especially LinkedIn — and, almost magically, we started finding them.\n\nThat’s how the Academic Think Tank (TATT) was born earlier this year. TATT brings together a select group of researchers, educators and entrepreneurs from all corners of the world with a shared vision of rethinking what academia 2.0 could look like: inclusive, sustainable and human.\n\nWe met five of our ten TATT members through LinkedIn. Our one selection criterion was simple: you have to care. You have to want to improve things and deeply want to make a difference for the people in the system. Our members span the globe — from Texas to Osaka, Japan. I would never have met these people in real life, but LinkedIn made it easy.",

      "content": "Adapted from Filo/Getty\n\nLike many epidemiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic, Katelyn Jetelina turned to social media to help keep people informed. It was the spring of 2020, and Jetelina, then at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, frequently posted content on viral transmission and vaccines to her Facebook and Instagram pages. That is, until she was hacked.\n\nIn February 2021, a group of anti-vaccine activists found a way into both accounts, using her platform to post and promote a different rhetoric. They even asked her followers to upload their COVID-19 vaccination cards for a chance to win US$1,000, in a bid to gain personal information. It was at this point that Jetelina decided she had to make a change. “It was heartbreaking to me: I had lost all of my content, and all of the blood, sweat and tears I had put into it,” she recalled. “I decided to move on to a platform where I had a whole lot more ownership.”\n\nScientists are falling victim to deepfake AI video scams — here’s how to fight back\n\nThe most obvious choice for her was Substack, an independent writing and e-mailing platform. It’s lauded for its newsletter features — sending posts into the inboxes of subscribers — but content is also available on the site, as with a standard blog. One feature she especially liked, given her past experiences, was that her data was transferable: if you decide to leave, or have to leave, you can take a list of subscriber e-mails with you. On 8 February 2021, Jetelina started putting more energy into her Substack publication, which she calls Your Local Epidemiologist.\n\nAlthough she eventually regained control of her social-media accounts, and her team still posts infographics and videos there, Jetelina says Substack enables her to connect with followers in a different way. As she explains it, the e-mail newsletter platform is more conducive to longer-form and more-nuanced discussions, which aren’t always possible on other forms of social media. Readers subscribe to her specifically, and content goes directly to their inbox, fostering more intimate and close-knit interactions. She says she’s come to know the readers well. “I can now have a two-way relationship with the audience, engaging with them through the comment and chat sections.”\n\nOver the past few years, the newsletter has garnered a strong following and now has more than 400,000 subscribers. What was once a one-woman show is now run by a team of copy editors, social-media creators, administrative assistants and other contributors. It’s also now Jetelina’s main job, she says. And as the pandemic public-health emergency has “faded into the rear-view mirror”, her content has had to change. Jetelina now aims to show the community that public health goes beyond a pandemic and infectious diseases, and writes about topics such as reproductive health, gun violence and mental health. “I’m really trying to focus on how to equip people with the tools to live an evidence-based life,” she says.\n\nKatelyn Jetelina switched to Substack after a group of anti-vaccine activists hacked her Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nFounded in 2017, Substack is meant to give a platform to independent writers, and provides a means for them to monetize their work through paywalls and donations. It’s grown rapidly and now has tens of millions of subscribers, and more than five million paid subscribers. The platform also raised $100 million to expand operations, giving the company a value of $1.1 billion. And it’s not exclusively for scientists: many other academics, as well as journalists and even novelists, have built up a community on the platform.\n\n“Substack is home to a growing number of respected academics and researchers who use the platform to share evidence-based work directly with the public,” a spokesperson told Nature. “For many, it’s a way to reach people more quickly and openly, while still maintaining depth and rigour.”\n\nNot every scientist has a following as large as that of Your Local Epidemiologist, which currently ranks number one on the list of paid science newsletters on Substacks. But other academics and scientists across various disciplines have gravitated towards the platform as a way to promote research and connect with the public.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nNonetheless, the site has its drawbacks. It can take a while to build a following, and making a profit can be hard work. Not only that, but many of the platform’s top science and health-politics newsletters promote anti-vaccine ideology or pseudoscience. “It’s the wild, wild west being on Substack, but right now this is the same on any sort of social-media platform,” says Jetelina. (A Substack spokesperson said that it would be inaccurate to characterize “a majority” of the top science writers as anti-vax.)\n\nStacking up\n\nSubstack and other subscription-based content services — such as Ghost, Mailchimp, Patreon, Beehiiv and Medium — market themselves as being more effective at reaching people than are conventional social media. This is partially backed by marketing data. According to Mailchimp, a US e-mail marketing platform, about 35% of users open e-mails from companies in the education and training sector; for other industries, the proportion is 30–40%. In a recent thread on Substack, writers shared the rates at which their subscribers opened their newsletters, and the proportions ranged from 30% to 70%.\n\nKimberly Nicholas, a sustainability researcher at Lund University, Sweden, whose Substack publication We Can Fix It approaches the climate crisis “with facts, feelings, and action”, says her e-mail newsletters are clicked on and opened more than her social-media posts.\n\nThe site also helps to foster an environment of community engagement. For Jonathan Tonkin, an ecologist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, the social-media platform X “was a really useful tool for scientists to communicate with other scientists, but in terms of reaching the public it wasn’t happening, to be honest”. Tonkin now authors a Substack publication called Predirections. “It’s good, I think, for reaching people who are interested in science and are not scientists,” he says.\n\nJonathan Tonkin found that Substack was much more effective than the social-media platform X as a means of engaging with interested non-scientists.Credit: Prime Minister’s Science Prizes Secretariat\n\nAccording to Similarweb, a traffic-analytics website, Substack’s audience is pretty evenly split between men and women. It skews a bit towards younger readers: the largest group consists of those aged 25–34. Users also tend to be based in the United States, with with about 62% of traffic coming from there in July 2025.\n\n“Scientific subjects are nuanced, and trying to distill that into 140 characters doesn't work very well, or leaves people confused,” adds Hannah Ritchie, a data scientist at the University of Oxford, UK. Ritchie’s Substack publication, Sustainability by Numbers, looks at potential routes to sustainability through an evidence-based lens. Putting together an e-mail, she says, “gives scientists a bit more room to describe the nuances”.\n\nHannah Ritchie points out that Substack frees writers from the constraints associated with more-formal means of publication, such as journals.Credit: Angela Catlin\n\nThen there’s the potential for monetization. Most of the scientists Nature spoke to emphasized that their content is free, but the site gives writers the ability to set up paywalls. According to Jetelina, 7% of her subscribers pay for her content. Although the platform takes a cut, she’s been able to generate enough revenue to quit her full-time job and focus mainly on the newsletter. (Jetelina did not want to share her earnings with Nature, but in 2022, the monthly magazine Vanity Fair reported that she made about $300,000 in the publication’s first nine months).\n\nScientists also highlight that Substack offers more freedom than do other modes of publishing science — in journals, for example, or through guest contributions to online publications such The Conversation. As Ritchie explains, there’s often a lengthy editorial process in these more-formal systems, and writers can be constrained by the requirements of the publication. “The timeline is massively extended compared to what you can do on Substack, where you can have your own audience: you can say what you want, when you want to say it.”",
