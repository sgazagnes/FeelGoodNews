      "title": "Scientists grow a tiny human “blood factory” that actually works",
      "summary": "Researchers have recreated a miniature human bone marrow system that mirrors the real structure found inside our bones. The model includes the full mix of cells and signals needed for blood production and even maintains this process for weeks. It could transform how scientists study blood cancers and test new drugs. In the future, it may support more personalized treatment strategies.",
      "content": "Our body's \"blood factory\" is made of highly specialized tissue containing bone cells, nerves, blood vessels and several other cell types. Researchers have now recreated this complex network in the laboratory using only human cells, marking a first in the field. This new system could help reduce the number of animal experiments needed for many types of research.\n\nThe bone marrow usually operates quietly and goes largely unnoticed. It becomes a focus of attention only when its function falters, such as in blood cancers. In those moments, knowing how blood is normally produced, and what causes that process to break down, becomes essential.\n\nHuman Cell Model Offers a New Research Tool\n\nFor decades, most studies on bone marrow have relied on animal research or simplified cell systems that cannot fully mimic the human environment. Scientists from the Department of Biomedicine at the University of Basel and University Hospital Basel have now produced a realistic bone marrow model made entirely from human cells. The team, led by Professor Ivan Martin and Dr Andrés García García, reports in Cell Stem Cell that this platform may support blood cancer studies, drug testing and possibly future personalized treatments.\n\nUnderstanding Bone Marrow Niches\n\nBone marrow contains several specialized microenvironments known as \"niches.\" One niche that plays a central role in creating new blood cells lies near the bone surface and is linked to blood cancer's ability to resist treatment. Called the endosteal niche, it features blood vessels, immune cells, nerves and bone cells. Until now, no human model had managed to include all of these components in a single system.\n\nThe researchers have now developed a model that replicates this complexity. Their work began with an artificial bone framework made of hydroxyapatite, a natural mineral found in teeth and bones. They then used human cells that had been reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells through molecular biology techniques. These stem cells can develop into many different cell types based on the signals present in their environment.\n\nBuilding a Functional 3D Bone Marrow System\n\nThe team introduced these stem cells into the artificial bone scaffold and guided them through controlled developmental steps to produce a diverse range of bone marrow cell types. Their analysis showed that the resulting three-dimensional structure closely matches the human endosteal niche. It is also larger than previous models, measuring eight millimeters in diameter and four millimeters in thickness. Using this model, the researchers were able to maintain human blood cell formation in the laboratory for several weeks.\n\nPotential to Reduce Animal Experiments\n\n\"We have learned a great deal about how bone marrow works from mouse studies,\" says Ivan Martin. \"However, our model brings us closer to the biology of the human organism. It could serve as a complement to many animal experiments in the study of blood formation in both healthy and diseased conditions.\" This goal aligns with the university's broader effort to reduce, refine and replace animal experiments whenever feasible.\n\nThe system could also support drug development. \"However, for this specific purpose, the size of our bone marrow model might be too large,\" explains Andrés García García. To test many drugs or doses at the same time, the platform would need to be made smaller.\n\nIn the future, this approach could help guide personalized treatment decisions for blood cancers. Researchers envision creating patient-specific bone marrow models that allow doctors to test therapies and identify the most effective option for each individual. Further improvements will be necessary before this becomes possible, but the study represents an important early step.",

      "title": "Scientists reawaken exhausted T cells to supercharge cancer immunity",
      "summary": "Researchers discovered a way to keep T cells from wearing out during the fight against cancer, and the approach could make immune-based treatments far more powerful. They found that tumors use a particular molecular signal to weaken T cells, and that interrupting this signal helps the cells stay active.",
      "content": "A new study has identified a molecular cue that cancer cells use to exhaust the T cells responsible for destroying them, and the findings show that shutting down this signal may help restore the body's immune defenses. The work, led by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and published Nov. 17 in Nature Immunology, reveals that tumors do more than slip past the immune system. They can also alter immune cells in ways that reduce their ability to fight back.\n\n\"Our dream is to make immune-based therapies available to every patient. To overcome resistance, we must unlock the power of exhausted T cells, reviving them to destroy cancer. This discovery moves us closer to a future where the immune system itself defeats tumors,\" said the study's co-senior author, Dr. Taha Merghoub, Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor in Oncology Research, and professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine.\n\nWhy Immunotherapies Sometimes Fall Short\n\nModern immunotherapies have reshaped cancer treatment by boosting the body's own defense system. However, not all patients benefit, and even those who do may see their response diminish as their T cells become overworked.\n\n\"Our findings reveal a completely new way that tumors suppress the immune system,\" said co-senior author Dr. Jedd Wolchok, the Meyer Director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, professor of medicine at Weill Cornell and an oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \"By blocking this pathway, we can help exhausted T cells recover their strength and make existing immunotherapies work better for more patients.\"\n\nHow T Cells Lose Their Ability to Fight\n\nT cell exhaustion occurs when the immune system faces long-term infections or persistent tumor activity. Under these conditions, T cells can still recognize harmful cells, yet they stop attacking. \"So, they're primed, but they're no longer killing,\" explained Dr. Merghoub, who is also deputy director of the Meyer Cancer Center and co-director of the Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy at Weill Cornell. He added that although this loss of activity seems harmful, it can prevent uncontrolled inflammation and sepsis.\n\nEarlier studies showed that a surface protein called PD1 contributes to this exhaustion process. Drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors target PD1 and have already proven effective at reviving T cells in cancers such as melanoma.\n\nCD47 Emerges as a Second Immune Brake\n\nThe research team set out to determine whether CD47, a molecule found on cancer cells, also plays a role in pushing T cells toward exhaustion. Previous work revealed that tumors use CD47 as a \"don't eat me signal\" to prevent certain immune cells from ingesting them.\n\nWhat surprised the scientists was discovering that T cells themselves display CD47. \"When T cells are activated, they express CD47. And when they get exhausted, they increase CD47 to very high levels,\" Dr. Merghoub said.\n\nExperiments showed that mice lacking CD47 had slower tumor growth, suggesting the exhaustion effect came from CD47 on immune cells rather than on cancer cells. In further tests, T cells missing CD47 were more effective against melanoma tumors than T cells that still carried the protein.\n\nThrombospondin-1 and CD47 Work Together to Exhaust T Cells\n\nThe team then investigated how cancer cells might manipulate this process. Their attention turned to thrombospondin-1, a large protein produced by metastatic cancer cells that binds to CD47. When mice were engineered to lack thrombospondin-1, their T cells showed fewer signs of exhaustion.\n\n\"That was the real eureka moment,\" said Dr. Merghoub. \"It showed us that CD47 and thrombospondin are clearly key players because eliminating either one gives you the same effect.\"\n\nDisrupting the Exhaustion Signal With TAX2\n\nTo understand the interaction more closely, the researchers used a peptide called TAX2, which was designed to block the connection between CD47 and thrombospondin-1. The results were clear: TAX2 helped maintain T cell activity and slowed tumor progression in mice with melanoma or colorectal cancer.\n\nT cells in treated animals stayed more active, released more immune-boosting cytokines, and were better at entering tumors. TAX2 also enhanced the effectiveness of PD1 immunotherapy in colorectal tumor models.\n\n\"We used the TAX2 peptide as a proof-of-concept to confirm that disrupting the crosstalk between TSP-1 and CD47 prevents T cell exhaustion in mice with tumors,\" said Dr. Chien-Huan (Gil) Weng, an instructor in pharmacology and the study's lead author. \"Next, we plan to study both upstream and downstream modulators that regulate the TSP-1:CD47 pathway and develop means to selectively, effectively and safely disrupt this pathway to improve T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.\"\n\nToward Stronger, Longer-Lasting Immune Therapies\n\nBlocking this interaction could serve as an effective therapy by itself and may also help sustain tumor-targeting T cells in patients who are at risk of becoming resistant to current immune checkpoint treatments. According to Dr. Merghoub, early experiments in animal models suggest that inhibiting both PD1 and CD47 creates T cells that are significantly better at destroying cancer cells. \"We plan to explore this therapeutic angle.\"\n\nMany Weill Cornell Medicine physicians and scientists collaborate with external organizations to advance scientific research and provide expert guidance. These relationships are disclosed publicly for transparency.

      "content": "A brain–computer interface developed by neurotechnology firm Paradromics contains electrodes that record from neurons in the cerebral cortex and then convert the information into intended speech patterns.Credit: Paradromics\n\nParadromics, a neurotechnology developer, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a first long-term clinical trial of its brain–computer interface (BCI). Early next year, the company — one of the closet rivals to Elon Musk’s neurotechnology firm Neuralink — will implant its device in two volunteers who were left unable to speak owing to neurological diseases and injuries. It has two goals: to ensure the device is safe; and to restore a person’s ability to communicate with real-time speech.\n\n“We’re very excited about bringing this new hardware into a trial,” says Matt Angle, chief executive of Paradromics, which is based in Austin, Texas.\n\nParadromics’ BCI has an active area of roughly 7.5 millimetres in diameter of thin, stiff, platinum-iridium electrodes that penetrate the surface of the cerebral cortex to record from individual neurons around 1.5 mm deep. This is then connected by wire to a power source and wireless transceiver implanted in an individual’s chest.\n\nInitially, the two volunteers will each have one electrode array implanted in the area of the motor cortex that controls the lips, tongue and larynx, Angle says. Neural activity will then be recorded from this region as the study participants imagine speaking sentences that are presented to them. Following previous work by researchers who are now collaborating with Paradromics1, the system learns what patterns of neural activity correspond to each intended speech sound.\n\nWhen participants imagine speaking these neural patterns will be converted into text on a screen for participants to approve, or into a real-time voice output based on old recordings of participants’ own voices.\n\nThis is the first BCI clinical trial to formally target synthetic-voice generation. “Arguably, the greatest quality of life change you can deliver right now with BCI is communication,” Angle says.\n\nElon Musk’s Neuralink brain chip: what scientists think of first human trial\n\nThe trial will also explore whether the system can reliably detect activity from imagined hand movements that would enable an individual to control a computer cursor. Depending on initial results, the trial could extend to ten volunteers with these participants receiving two cortical implants to increase signal richness and to access other brain areas, says Angle.\n\n“I’m very curious. It’s an exciting step,” says Mariska Vansteensel, a BCI researcher at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. “For the field to move forward towards clinical applications, a fully implantable system is the only way to go.”\n\nNeuralink rivals\n\nParadromics is now one of several companies testing an implanted BCI system that is similar to what it intends to market in a long-term trial. Several more companies hope to follow suit soon.\n\nFurthest along is Synchron, a BCI company in New York City, and its device Stentrode. By incorporating 12–16 electrodes into a device that is based on an endovascular stent, the Stentrode records the average activity of a neuronal population from inside a blood vessel. Initial trials utilized a vessel in the motor cortex to allow users to select onscreen options by imagining that they are moving their foot.\n\nNeuralink has prioritized obtaining high-bandwidth signals by recording outputs from many single neurons. Its BCI consists of 64 flexible polymer threads, each with 16 recording sites. In the company’s initial trial, it targeted the region of the motor cortex that controls the hand. Users controlled computers and robotic hands with their thoughts, and the company has regularly reported that it is able to transfer information from people’s brains to computers at record-breaking speeds.\n\nA clinical trial will assess the safety and durability of Paradromics’ brain–computer interface after it has been surgically implanted into the brains of two volunteers.Credit: University of Michigan\n\nOther systems in development include several BCIs that place high-density electrodes on the brain’s surface to record the average activity of underlying neuronal populations.\n\nAs long-term trials now progress, clinicians and neuroscientists will be watching and comparing devices. Vansteensel says she hopes companies will be fully transparent and that in time they will make their devices available to academics to conduct independent studies.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nDignity and wellness access for underserved populations\n\nWelcome to the fourth installment of The Optimist Daily’s Annual Local Changemakers series. Over five weeks, we’re spotlighting ten extraordinary individuals and organizations transforming their communities with compassion, creativity, and resilience. This week, we highlight changemakers who are restoring dignity through wellness, nourishment, and care for those who need it most.\n\nJoin us in Black Mountain, North Carolina, where one woman’s life-altering trauma gave rise to a vibrant, community-led wellness movement nourishing thousands.\n\nFrom trauma to transformation: the beginnings of Bounty & Soul\n\nBefore she founded a nonprofit that now nourishes 850 families a week, Ali Casparian’s dreams were rooted in food. As a young girl, she found joy in the kitchen with her Armenian grandmother and in the garden with her grandfather. She wanted to become a chef, but at the time, her parents didn’t approve of that path. So, she pivoted away from culinary school, earned a degree in human resource management, and built a 25-year career in the food industry.\n\nStill, something was missing. Behind her professional success was a deep sense of loneliness and burnout. Then, in 2011, everything changed. Casparian survived a brutal domestic assault that left her hospitalized for months. Forced to start over after this traumatic event, she began to see the world and her purpose in it with new clarity.\n\n“All of a sudden, everything seemed different in a good way,” she told Black Mountain News. “The flowers were brighter and the colors were brighter. The sounds were louder. I felt a deeper empathy.”\n\nShe walked away from her old life, her career, her home, and her city. To recenter, she spent time with family in Raleigh before moving to western North Carolina, where she would begin a revolutionary new chapter.\n\nA table, a welcome, and a seed\n\nWhen she arrived in Black Mountain, Casparian was rebuilding her life from scratch. She cleaned houses to make ends meet and searched for connection. That search led her to the Welcome Table at St. James Episcopal Church, a community meal where she eventually began volunteering.\n\nOne day, she spotted a surplus of fresh fruits and vegetables at a nearby food bank, and it dawned on her that this perfectly good food would be discarded or given to livestock. In a moment of inspiration Casparian arranged for the produce to be brought to Welcome Table, where she set up a small table of her own so people could take what they needed.\n\nBut for Casparian, it was never just about the food. “I always had to prove that I was poor,” she recalled of past experiences seeking help. “It was awful… So what was important to me was that everybody would feel loved and accepted and included, and they wouldn’t feel any shame.”\n\nFrom that one table grew Bounty & Soul: a nonprofit that, from its inception, has prioritized nourishment not just of the body but of the whole self.\n\nFood access with a soul-centered approach\n\nIncorporated in 2014, Bounty & Soul offers free, fresh produce and wellness education through weekly drive-thru markets that serve up to 850 families. But the programming goes much deeper than access to food.\n\nEvery element of Bounty & Soul is designed to foster connection, dignity, and empowerment. Classes are co-created with community input and have ranged from yoga and diabetes prevention to financial literacy and parenting support. Participants are called “friends” instead of clients or recipients, and they are encouraged to volunteer, contribute ideas, and be part of shaping the space.\n\nThe work is intensely personal for Casparian, who often speaks about how the organization’s evolution mirrored her own healing journey. In the early days, she lived in what she called a one-room “chicken coop.” Now, she leads a respected nonprofit that has distributed millions of pounds of produce, formed partnerships with health systems, schools, and farms, and is currently seeking to launch a permanent wellness hub.\n\nExpanding impact, deepening roots\n\nAs Bounty & Soul has grown, so has its reach. Development Director Laila, shared with The Optimist Daily that, as of this month, Bounty & Soul has:\n\nServed 251,228 individuals\n\nProvided 1,807,786 pounds of produce\n\nInvested $930,305 into the local food system through produce purchases\n\nOffered (and continue to offer) 10 weekly no-cost community markets\n\nLogged approximately 11,000 volunteer hours with 175 volunteer slots each week\n\nIt’s often in moments of crisis that Bounty & Soul’s work becomes especially vital and most deeply felt. When SNAP benefits were paused during the recent government shutdown, a woman on disability called the team in distress. Unsure of how she would get food that week, she reached out hoping for options. Bounty & Soul connected her to a market happening that same day, where she picked up fresh leafy greens, sweet potatoes, bell peppers, and eggs. Overwhelmed with relief, she burst into tears. Encounters like these are a stark reminder that food insecurity isn’t a distant issue. Food insecurity is something that people in the community, friends, and neighbors are living with right now.\n\nAnother woman, living with cancer, has been coming to the markets regularly since the spring. Following her doctor’s recommendation to increase fruits and vegetables to support her treatment, she relies on the Produce to the People program to make that possible while living on a fixed income.\n\nThese are just a few of the quiet, everyday moments that show what “food is medicine” truly looks like, and why access, dignity, and consistency matter so much.\n\nGrowing together: from local farms to fermentation workshops\n\nBounty & Soul also champions the local food economy, partnering with over 70 regional farms and growers. One local farm had a peach surplus at the end of summer. Bounty & Soul quickly arranged to purchase 600 pounds of the harvest, supporting the farmer’s income while delighting the community with ripe, juicy fruit. This type of reciprocal relationship strengthens the bond between people, land, and nourishment.\n\nThe nonprofit’s holistic approach includes programs like Rooted in Health, which offers culturally relevant, community-designed education and wellness. One popular class, “Cooking for One,” was created to help solo-living individuals prepare fresh, easy meals. This winter, the organization will host a Holiday Fermentation Workshop with Meg Chamberlin, founder of Fermenti, teaching participants how to turn seasonal produce into probiotic-rich, preserved foods.\n\nFrom personal survival to collective thriving\n\nAli Casparian doesn’t sugarcoat the pain that preceded her current path. But she also doesn’t dwell there. Instead, she channels her experience into action, co-creating a space where food is love, wellness is shared, and healing is possible.\n\n“If that didn’t happen … I wouldn’t be sitting here,” she said of her past. “And I wouldn’t be loved in the way I am loved or be able to offer and work within the community the way we work together collectively, which has been the greatest gift of my life.”\n\nWant to support Bounty & Soul?",
