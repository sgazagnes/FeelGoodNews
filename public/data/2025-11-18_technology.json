      "title": "Princeton’s new quantum chip marks a major step toward quantum advantage",
      "summary": "A Princeton team built a new tantalum-silicon qubit that survives for over a millisecond, far surpassing today’s best devices. The design tackles surface defects and substrate losses that have limited transmon qubits for years. Easy to integrate into existing quantum chips, the approach could make processors like Google’s vastly more powerful.",
      "content": "Princeton engineers have created a superconducting qubit that remains stable for three times longer than the strongest designs available today. This improvement represents an important move toward building quantum computers that can operate reliably.\n\n\"The real challenge, the thing that stops us from having useful quantum computers today, is that you build a qubit and the information just doesn't last very long,\" said Andrew Houck, leader of a federally funded national quantum research center, Princeton's dean of engineering and co-principal investigator on the paper. \"This is the next big jump forward.\"\n\nIn a Nov. 5 article published in Nature, the Princeton team reported that their qubit maintains coherence for more than 1 millisecond. This performance is triple the longest lifetime documented in laboratory experiments and nearly fifteen times greater than the standard used in industrial quantum processors. To confirm the result, the team constructed a functioning quantum chip based on the new qubit, demonstrating that the design can support error correction and scale toward larger systems.\n\nThe researchers noted that their qubit is compatible with the architectures used by major companies such as Google and IBM. According to their analysis, replacing key components in Google's Willow processor with Princeton's approach could increase its performance by a factor of 1,000. Houck added that as quantum systems incorporate more qubits, the advantages of this design increase even more rapidly.\n\nWhy Better Qubits Matter for Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computers show promise for solving problems that traditional computers cannot address. Yet their current abilities remain limited because qubits lose their information before complex calculations can be completed. Extending coherence time is therefore essential for building practical quantum hardware. Princeton's improvement represents the largest single gain in coherence time in more than ten years.\n\nMany labs are pursuing different qubit technologies, but Princeton's design builds on a widely used approach known as the transmon qubit. Transmons, which operate as superconducting circuits held at extremely low temperatures, are known for being resistant to environmental interference and compatible with modern manufacturing tools.\n\nDespite these strengths, increasing the coherence time of transmon qubits has proven difficult. Recent results from Google showed that material defects now pose the main barrier to improving their newest processor.\n\nTantalum and Silicon: A New Materials Strategy\n\nThe Princeton team developed a two-part strategy to address these material challenges. First, they incorporated tantalum, a metal known for helping delicate circuits retain energy. Second, they replaced the standard sapphire substrate with high-purity silicon, a material foundational to the computing industry. Growing tantalum directly on silicon required solving several technical problems related to how the two materials interact, but the researchers succeeded and uncovered significant advantages in the process.\n\nNathalie de Leon, co-director of Princeton's Quantum Initiative and co-principal investigator of the project, said the tantalum-silicon design not only performs better than previous approaches but is also simpler to manufacture at scale. \"Our results are really pushing the state of the art,\" she said.\n\nMichel Devoret, chief scientist for hardware at Google Quantum AI, which provided partial funding, described the difficulty of extending the lifetime of quantum circuits. He noted that the challenge had become a \"graveyard\" of attempted solutions. \"Nathalie really had the guts to pursue this strategy and make it work,\" said Devoret, the 2025 Nobel Prize winner in physics.\n\nThe project received primary funding from the U.S. Department of Energy National Quantum Information Science Research Centers and the Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage (C2QA), a center directed by Houck from 2021 to 2025 and where he now serves as chief scientist. The paper lists postdoctoral researcher Faranak Bahrami and graduate student Matthew P. Bland as co-lead authors.\n\nHow Tantalum Improves Qubit Stability\n\nHouck, the Anthony H.P. Lee '79 P11 P14 Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, explained that a quantum computer's capability depends on two main factors. One is the total number of qubits that can be linked together. The other is how many operations each qubit can complete before errors accumulate. Improving the durability of a single qubit strengthens both of these factors. Longer coherence time directly supports scaling and more reliable error correction.\n\nEnergy loss is the most common cause of failure in these systems. Microscopic surface defects in the metal can trap energy and disrupt the qubit during calculations. These disruptions multiply as more qubits are added. Tantalum is especially beneficial because it typically contains fewer of these defects than metals like aluminum. With fewer defects, the system produces fewer errors and simplifies the process of correcting the ones that remain.\n\nHouck and de Leon introduced tantalum for superconducting chips in 2021 with help from Princeton chemist Robert Cava, the Russell Wellman Moore Professor of Chemistry. Cava, who specializes in superconducting materials, became interested in the problem after hearing one of de Leon's talks. Their conversations eventually led him to suggest tantalum as a promising material. \"Then she went and did it,\" Cava said. \"That's the amazing part.\"\n\nResearchers across all three labs followed this idea and built a tantalum-based superconducting circuit on a sapphire substrate. The result showed a significant improvement in coherence time, approaching the previous world record.\n\nBahrami noted that tantalum stands out because it is extremely durable and can withstand the harsh cleaning used to remove contamination during fabrication. \"You can put tantalum in acid, and still the properties don't change,\" she said.\n\nOnce contaminants were removed, the team evaluated the remaining energy losses. They found that the sapphire substrate was responsible for most of the remaining problems. Switching to high-purity silicon eliminated that source of loss, and the combination of tantalum and silicon, along with refined fabrication techniques, produced one of the biggest improvements ever achieved in a transmon qubit. Houck described the outcome as \"a major breakthrough on the path to enabling useful quantum computing.\"\n\nHouck added that because the benefits of the design increase exponentially as systems grow, replacing today's industry-leading qubits with the Princeton version could allow a theoretical 1,000-qubit computer to operate about 1 billion times more effectively.\n\nSilicon-Based Design Supports Industry-Scale Growth\n\nThe project draws from three areas of expertise. Houck's group focuses on the design and optimization of superconducting circuits. De Leon's lab specializes in quantum metrology along with the materials and fabrication methods that determine qubit performance. Cava's group has spent decades developing superconducting materials. By combining their strengths, the team produced results that none of the groups could have achieved individually. Their success has already attracted attention from the quantum industry.\n\nDevoret said collaborations between universities and companies are essential for moving advanced technologies forward. \"There is a rather harmonious relationship between industry and academic research,\" he said. University researchers can investigate the fundamental limits of quantum performance, while industry partners apply those findings to large-scale systems.\n\n\"We've shown that it's possible in silicon,\" de Leon said. \"The fact that we've shown what the critical steps are, and the important underlying characteristics that will enable these kinds of coherence times, now makes it pretty easy for anyone who's working on scaled processors to adopt.\"\n\nThe paper \"Millisecond lifetimes and coherence times in 2D transmon qubits\" was published in Nature on Nov. 5. Along with de Leon, Houck, Cava, Bahrami, and Bland, the authors include Jeronimo G.C. Martinez, Paal H. Prestegaard, Basil M. Smitham, Atharv Joshi, Elizabeth Hedrick, Alex Pakpour-Tabrizi, Shashwat Kumar, Apoorv Jindal, Ray D. Chang, Ambrose Yang, Guangming Cheng and Nan Yao.

They hope to push the technique toward imaging particles as small as viruses.",
      "content": "Researchers Kohki Horie, Keiichiro Toda, Takuma Nakamura, and Takuro Ideguchi at the University of Tokyo have created a microscope capable of detecting signals across an intensity range fourteen times broader than that of standard instruments. The system also works label-free, meaning it does not rely on added dyes. This gentle approach allows cells to remain unharmed during long-term imaging, which could benefit testing and quality control in pharmaceutical and biotechnology settings. The study appears in Nature Communications.\n\nMicroscopes have driven scientific progress since the 16th century, but major improvements have often required increasingly specialized tools. As techniques became more advanced, they also faced tradeoffs in what they could measure. Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) uses forward-scattered light to visualize structures at the microscale (in this study, over 100 nanometers), which makes it useful for capturing still images of complex cell features. However, QPM cannot detect very small particles. Interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy works differently by capturing back-scattered light and can detect structures as tiny as single proteins. While iSCAT enables researchers to \"track\" individual particles and observe rapid changes inside cells, it lacks the wider view offered by QPM.\n\nCapturing Two Directions of Light at Once\n\n\"I would like to understand dynamic processes inside living cells using non-invasive methods,\" says Horie, one of the first authors.\n\nMotivated by this goal, the team examined whether collecting light from both directions at the same time could bridge the gap and reveal activity across a broad range of sizes and motions in a single image. To explore the idea and confirm that their microscope performed as expected, they observed how cells behaved during cell death. In one experiment, they captured an image that contained information from both forward- and backward-traveling light.\n\nSeparating Overlapping Signals\n\n\"Our biggest challenge,\" Toda, another first author, explains, \"was cleanly separating two kinds of signals from a single image while keeping noise low and avoiding mixing between them.\"\n\nThe researchers succeeded in identifying the movement of larger cell structures (micro) as well as much smaller particles (nano). By comparing the patterns in forward- and back-scattered light, they could estimate each particle's size and its refractive index, which describes how strongly light bends or scatters when it passes through a material.\n\nFuture Applications for Smaller Particles\n\n\"We plan to study even smaller particles,\" Toda says, already thinking about future research, \"such as exosomes and viruses, and to estimate their size and refractive index in different samples. We also want to reveal how living cells move toward death by controlling their state and double-checking our results with other techniques.\"",

The Data and Reasoning Fabric project out of Ames Research Center tested delivery of programs and information to these kinds of vehicles. Credit: NASA\n\nOne of the biggest goals for companies in the field of artificial intelligence is developing “agentic” or autonomous systems. These metaphorical agents can perform tasks without a guiding human hand. This parallels the goals of the emerging urban air mobility industry, which hopes to bring autonomous flying vehicles to cities around the world. One company got a head start on doing both with some help from NASA.\n\nAutonomy Association International Inc. (AAI) is a public benefit corporation based in Mountain View, California, near NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. In 2022, AAI signed a Space Act Agreement with Ames to support the agency’s Data and Reasoning Fabric project, which aimed to support the transportation of people and cargo to areas previously unserved or underserved by aviation, and to provide reliable, accurate, and current data for aeronautic decision-making.\n\n“Inspiration to lean into data fabric to solve certain complexities came from our NASA partnership,” said AAI cofounder and the project’s industry principal investigator Greg Deeds. “Working on this project was a great experience. Working with NASA engineers and leaders gave us experience that we’ll carry forward in all of our products.”\n\nGreg Deeds looks out the window of a helicopter flying over Arizona during a test of Autonomy Association International’s data fabric technology in collaboration with NASA. Through multiple evaluations above Phoenix, the testing proved the capabilities of the company’s Digital Infrastructure Platform. Credit: Autonomy Association International Inc.\n\nSimilar to how clothing fabric is made of intertwined threads, a data fabric comprises intertwined data sources. While a data fabric built by a tech company may include data from a few different cloud service providers, NASA’s Data and Reasoning Fabric can also use information provided by local governments and other service providers. By viewing airspace as a large data fabric, an autonomous vehicle can take in data and requests from the cities and towns it flies over and prioritize responses between them.\n\nWorking with Ken Freeman, principal investigator of the project at Ames, AAI and NASA performed four testing adaptations of the data fabric technology in the air over Arizona. Using hardware and software developed by AAI, the flights tested advanced air mobility passenger flights and the use of a drone for rapid delivery of medical supplies from urban to rural areas and back, while sending new tasks to the aircraft in flight. A helicopter stood in for the drone and air taxi, flying over towns, universities, tribal lands, and the airspace around Phoenix Sky Harbor airport and obtaining data and programs given to it from different places.\n\n“We’re focusing on the digital infrastructure building blocks of smart cities and regions of the future,” said Jennifer Deeds, chief operating officer and cofounder of AAI.\n\nIn the years since the original NASA project, the company has cultivated relationships and customers abroad, including companies in agriculture, real estate development, and industrial food production using its system to aggregate and manage data. Released in 2024, the company’s Digital Infrastructure Platform uses the same technology originally designed for the NASA flight test. A new, “agentic” version followed not long after, able to retrieve necessary AI programs with minimal interaction.\n\nAs AI unlocks innovation across American industries, NASA is equipping its commercial partners with the keys, using proven technology to generate breakthrough solutions.\n\nLearn more: https://spinoff.nasa.gov/",
