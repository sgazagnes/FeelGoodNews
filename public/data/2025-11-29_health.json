      "title": "A strange ancient foot reveals a hidden human cousin",
      "summary": "Researchers have finally assigned a strange 3.4-million-year-old foot to Australopithecus deyiremeda, confirming that Lucy’s species wasn’t alone in ancient Ethiopia. This hominin had an opposable big toe for climbing but still walked upright in a distinct style. Isotope tests show it ate different foods from A. afarensis, revealing clear ecological separation. These insights help explain how multiple early human species co-existed without wiping each other out.",
      "content": "Thanks to newly discovered fossil bones, scientists have now been able to match an enigmatic 3.4-million-year-old hominin foot, first found in 2009, to a species that is different from the famous fossil Lucy. This link strengthens the case that two separate species of early human ancestors were living in the same region at the same time.\n\nIn 2009, a research team led by Arizona State University paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie uncovered eight bones from the foot of an ancient human ancestor in 3.4-million-year-old sediments in the Afar Rift of Ethiopia. The fossil, known as the Burtele Nature Foot, was recovered at the Woranso-Mille paleontological site and was formally introduced in a 2012 publication.\n\n\"When we found the foot in 2009 and announced it in 2012, we knew that it was different from Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, which is widely known from that time,\" said Haile-Selassie, director of the Institute of Human Origins (IHO) and a professor in the ASU School of Human Evolution and Social Change.\n\n\"However, it is not common practice in our field to name a species based on postcranial elements -elements below the neck -- so we were hoping that we would find something above the neck in clear association with the foot. Crania, jaws and teeth are usually the elements used in species recognition.\"\n\nConnecting the Burtele Foot to Australopithecus deyiremeda\n\nWhen the Burtele foot was first described, some teeth had already been recovered from the same general area. However, scientists were unsure whether those teeth came from exactly the same sediment layer as the foot. In 2015, the team announced a new species from the region, Australopithecus deyiremeda, but did not yet assign the Burtele foot to this species, even though some of the fossils were found very close to the foot, explained Haile-Selassie.\n\nOver the next decade, repeated field seasons and additional fossil discoveries allowed the team to build a stronger picture. Haile-Selassie said they now have enough material to confidently link the Burtele foot with the species A. deyiremeda.\n\nTwo Hominin Species Sharing the Same Landscape\n\nThe decision to place the Burtele foot in a specific species is only one part of a larger story. The Woranso-Mille site is especially important because it provides clear evidence that two closely related hominin species were living in the same area at the same time.\n\nThe Burtele foot, now associated with A. deyiremeda, is considered more primitive than the feet of Lucy's species, A. afarensis. Unlike Lucy, the Burtele foot kept an opposable big toe, which would have been useful for climbing. On the ground, however, A. deyiremeda still walked on two legs and appears to have pushed off primarily from the second toe rather than the big toe, which is how modern humans typically walk.\n\n\"The presence of an abducted big toe in Ardipithecus ramidus was a big surprise because at 4.4 million-years-ago there was still an early hominin ancestor which retained an opposable big toe, which was totally unexpected,\" said Haile-Selassie.\n\n\"Then 1-million-years later, at 3.4-million-years ago, we find the Burtele foot, which is even more surprising. This is a time when we see species like A. afarensis whose members were fully bipedal with an adducted big toe. What that means is that bipedality -- walking on two legs -- in these early human ancestors came in various forms. The whole idea of finding specimens like the Burtele foot tells you that there were many ways of walking on two legs when on the ground, there was not just one way until later.\"\n\nIsotope Evidence Highlights Different Hominin Diets\n\nTo better understand what A. deyiremeda ate, Naomi Levin, a professor at the University of Michigan, analyzed eight of the 25 teeth recovered from the Burtele area using isotope techniques. The method begins with cleaning the tooth surface and then carefully removing only the enamel for testing.\n\n\"I sample the tooth with a dental drill and a very tiny (< 1mm) bit -- this equipment is the same kind that dentists use to work on your teeth,\" said Levin. \"With this drill I carefully remove small amounts of powder. I store that powder in a plastic vial and transport it back to our lab at the University of Michigan for isotopic analysis.\"\n\nThe findings were unexpected.\n\nWhile Lucy's species appears to have had a mixed diet, using both C3 (resources from trees and shrubs) and C4 plants (tropical grasses and sedges), A. deyiremeda relied more heavily on C3 resources.\n\n\"I was surprised that the carbon isotope signal was so clear and so similar to the carbon isotope data from the older hominins A. ramidus and Au. anamensis,\" said Levin. \"I thought the distinctions between the diet of A. deyiremeda and A. afarensis would be harder to identify but the isotope data show clearly that A. deyiremeda wasn't accessing the same range of resources as A. afarensis, which is the earliest hominin shown to make use of C4 grass-based food resources.\"\n\nDating Fossils and Reconstructing Ancient Environments\n\nAnother crucial part of the research involved pinning down the age of the fossils and reconstructing the ancient environments in which these hominins lived. Establishing how the fossil layers line up over space and time helps scientists understand when, and under what conditions, each species existed.\n\n\"We have done a tremendous amount of careful field work at Woranso-Mille to establish how different fossil layers relate, which is crucial to understanding when and in what settings the different species lived,\" said Beverly Saylor, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Case Western Reserve University. Saylor led the geological work that established the stratigraphic association between the foot and Au. deyiermeda.\n\nJuvenile Jaw Offers Clues to Growth and Development\n\nAlongside the 25 teeth recovered from Burtele, Haile-Selassie's team also discovered the jaw of a juvenile individual that, based on tooth anatomy, clearly belonged to A. deyiremeda. According to Gary Schwartz, IHO research scientist and professor at the School of Human Evolution and Social Change, this jaw contained a complete set of baby teeth already in place, as well as many adult teeth still developing deep inside the lower jawbone.\n\nThe researchers used CT scanning technology to visualize all of the developing teeth. Because tooth development is closely linked to overall growth patterns, this information helped the team estimate that the youngster was about 4.5 years old at the time of death.\n\n\"For a juvenile hominin of this age, we were able to see clear traces of a disconnect in growth between the front teeth (incisors) and the back chewing teeth (molars), much like is seen in living apes and in other early australopiths, like Lucy's species,\" said Schwartz.\n\n\"I think the biggest surprise was despite our growing awareness of how diverse these early australopith (i.e., early hominin) species were -- in their size, in their diet, in their locomotor repertoires and in their anatomy -- these early australopiths seem to be remarkably similar in the manner in which they grew up.\"\n\nHow Ancient Hominins Lived Together\n\nBy combining information about movement (locomotion), diet and environment, scientists are gaining new insight into how different hominin species could live in the same region without one driving the other to extinction. Differences in how they walked, climbed and fed may have allowed them to share the landscape by using it in distinct ways.\n\n\"All of our research to understand past ecosystems from millions of years ago is not just about curiosity or figuring out where we came from, said Haile-Selassie. \"It is our eagerness to learn about our present and the future as well.\"\n\n\"If we don't understand our past, we can't fully understand the present or our future. What happened in the past, we see it happening today,\" he said. \"In a lot of ways, the climate change that we see today has happened so many times during the times of Lucy and A. deyiremeda. What we learn from that time could actually help us mitigate some of the worst outcomes of climate change today.\"\n\nPublication, Research Team and Funding\n\nThe paper, \"New finds shed light on diet and locomotion in Australopithecus deyiremeda,\" appears in the journal Nature. The international research team included scientists from Arizona State University, Washington University, St. Louis, Case Western Reserve University, Berkeley Geochronology Center, Universitat de Barcelona, University of Tampa and University of Michigan.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have studied fossils from Ethiopia that are about 3.4 million years old. These fossils come from early human ancestors called hominins. One famous ancestor from this time is Lucy, from the species Australopithecus afarensis.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers found a strange foot fossil in 2009 in Ethiopia's Afar Rift. After years of study, they confirmed this foot belongs to a different species called Australopithecus deyiremeda. This species had a big toe that could move like a thumb to help climb trees, but it also walked on two legs in a unique way. Scientists also tested teeth from this species and found they ate different foods than Lucy's species.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows that two different early human species lived together in the same place but used the environment differently. One climbed trees more, while the other walked differently on the ground. Their diets were also different, which helped them share the land without competing too much. This helps us understand how early humans evolved and lived side by side.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will continue searching for more fossils to learn more about how these species lived, grew, and adapted. They also want to study how changes in climate affected them. This research may help us understand how humans might respond to environmental changes today.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The discovery of a 3.4-million-year-old foot linked to Australopithecus deyiremeda reveals new ways early humans walked, ate, and lived alongside each other in ancient Ethiopia.",

      "summary": "Princeton researchers found that the brain excels at learning because it reuses modular “cognitive blocks” across many tasks. Monkeys switching between visual categorization challenges revealed that the prefrontal cortex assembles these blocks like Legos to create new behaviors. This flexibility explains why humans learn quickly while AI models often forget old skills. The insights may help build better AI and new clinical treatments for impaired cognitive adaptability.",
      "content": "Artificial intelligence can now craft award-winning essays and help doctors detect disease with impressive accuracy. Yet when it comes to true mental flexibility, living brains still have the clear advantage.\n\nHumans can adjust to new situations and information with remarkable ease. Learning unfamiliar computer software, trying a new recipe, or figuring out the rules of a new game often happens quickly for people, while AI systems typically struggle to adapt in real time and to learn effectively \"on the fly.\"\n\nIn a new study, neuroscientists at Princeton University identify one key reason for this difference. The human brain repeatedly reuses the same cognitive \"blocks\" across many different situations, combining and recombining them to form new patterns of behavior.\n\n\"State-of-the-art AI models can reach human, or even super-human, performance on individual tasks. But they struggle to learn and perform many different tasks,\" said Tim Buschman, Ph.D., senior author of the study and associate director of the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. \"We found that the brain is flexible because it can reuse components of cognition in many different tasks. By snapping together these 'cognitive Legos,' the brain is able to build new tasks.\"\n\nThe research was published on November 26 in the journal Nature.\n\nCompositionality: reusing skills in new situations\n\nIf someone already knows how to tune a bicycle, learning to repair a motorcycle can feel more straightforward. That ability to build a new skill out of simpler, familiar ones drawn from related experiences is known as compositionality.\n\n\"If you already know how to bake bread, you can use this ability to bake a cake without relearning how to bake from scratch,\" said Sina Tafazoli, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Buschman lab at Princeton and lead author of the new study. \"You repurpose existing skills -- using an oven, measuring ingredients, kneading dough -- and combine them with new ones, like whipping batter and making frosting, to create something entirely different.\"\n\nUntil now, evidence for exactly how the brain supports this kind of flexible, compositional thinking has been limited and sometimes conflicting.\n\nTo get a clearer picture, Tafazoli trained two male rhesus macaques to carry out three related tasks while recording activity across their brains.\n\nTesting flexibility with visual categorization tasks\n\nInstead of real-world jobs like baking or bike repair, the animals were asked to perform three visual categorization tasks. On a screen, they saw a series of colorful, balloon-like blobs. Their job was to decide whether each blob looked more like a bunny or the letter \"T\" (categorizing the shape) or whether it appeared more red or more green (categorizing color).\n\nThe challenge was more difficult than it sounded. The blobs varied in how clear the differences were. Some images obviously resembled a bunny or were vividly red, while others were ambiguous and required careful judgment to tell the categories apart.\n\nTo report their decision about the shape or color, each monkey indicated its answer by looking in one of four different directions on the screen. In one version of the task, for example, looking left meant the animal judged the blob to be a bunny, while looking right signaled that it looked more like a \"T.\"\n\nA crucial part of the experiment was that each task had its own specific rules, yet still shared key components with the others.\n\nOne of the color tasks and the shape task required the animals to look in the same directions to indicate their choices, while both color tasks asked the monkeys to categorize the color in the same way (as either more red or more green) but to look in different directions when signaling their color judgment (categorizing the color).\n\nThis design allowed the researchers to see whether the brain reused the same neural patterns, or cognitive building blocks, whenever tasks shared certain features.\n\nPrefrontal cortex as a hub for reusable cognitive blocks\n\nAfter examining patterns of brain activity, Tafazoli and Buschman found that the prefrontal cortex, a region at the front of the brain involved in high-level thinking and decision-making, contained several recurring patterns of activity. These patterns appeared whenever groups of neurons worked together toward a common goal, such as distinguishing colors.\n\nBuschman referred to these patterns as the brain's \"cognitive Legos,\" a set of building blocks that can be flexibly combined to produce different behaviors.\n\n\"I think about a cognitive block like a function in a computer program,\" Buschman said. \"One set of neurons might discriminate color, and its output can be mapped onto another function that drives an action. That organization allows the brain to perform a task by sequentially performing each component of that task.\"\n\nFor one of the color tasks, for instance, the brain would assemble a block that determines the color of the image together with another block that guides eye movements in particular directions. When the animal switched to a different task, such as judging shapes instead of colors while still using similar eye movements, the brain simply activated the block for shape processing along with the block for those same eye movements.\n\nThis sharing of blocks appeared primarily in the prefrontal cortex and was not seen to the same extent in other brain regions. The finding suggests that this type of compositionality may be a distinctive feature of the prefrontal cortex.\n\nTurning blocks on and off to sharpen focus\n\nTafazoli and Buschman also observed that the prefrontal cortex seemed to quiet certain cognitive blocks when they were not needed. This likely helps the brain concentrate on the most relevant task at any given moment.\n\n\"The brain has a limited capacity for cognitive control,\" Tafazoli said. \"You have to compress some of your abilities so that you can focus on those that are currently important. Focusing on shape categorization, for example, momentarily diminishes the ability to encode color because the goal is shape discrimination, not color.\"\n\nBy selectively activating and suppressing different blocks, the brain can avoid being overloaded and can keep performance focused on the current goal.\n\nCognitive Legos, AI, and mental health\n\nThese cognitive Legos may help explain why people are often able to pick up new tasks so rapidly. The brain does not always need to start from scratch. Instead, it can draw on existing mental components, recombine them, and avoid duplicating work, a strategy that current AI systems generally lack.\n\n\"A major issue with machine learning is catastrophic interference,\" Tafazoli said. \"When a machine or a neural network learns something new, they forget and overwrite previous memories. If an artificial neural network knows how to bake a cake but then learns to bake cookies, it will forget how to bake a cake.\"\n\nIncorporating compositionality into AI could eventually make artificial systems more human-like in their learning, allowing them to acquire new skills over time without erasing older ones.\n\nThe same principles could also influence medicine. Many neurological and psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and some forms of brain injury, can make it difficult for people to apply existing skills in new situations. These problems may arise when the brain can no longer smoothly recombine its cognitive building blocks.\n\n\"Imagine being able to help people regain the ability to shift strategies, learn new routines, or adapt to change,\" Tafazoli said. \"In the long run, understanding how the brain reuses and recombines knowledge could help us design therapies that restore that process.\"\n\nFunding for the study was provided by the National Institutes of Health (R01MH129492, 5T32MH065214).",

Credit: Addictive Stock Creatives/Alamy\n\nInserting easy-to-release slipknots into surgical thread could help surgeons to tie perfect sutures — tight enough to help heal a wound but not so tight that they damage tissue.\n\nResearchers worked out how to precisely control a knot’s geometry and friction so that they could ‘program’ it to open when tugged on with a specific force.\n\nThis allows a surgeon — or a robot — stitching up a wound to pull a suture closed with just the right amount of force, tugging the free end of the knotted thread and stopping when the knot unfurls. Getting the force right is important: stitches that are too tight or too loose can lead to complications.\n\nIn simulated operations described in Nature on 26 November1, the slipknot technique allowed inexperienced surgeons to perform sutures as well as their experienced peers. When used in rats, slipknot-aided colon surgery led to blood flow being restored faster, fewer leaks and less scar tissue than is usually the case for conventional stitches.\n\nStitches made simple\n\nSurgeons usually gauge how much tension is in stitches by look and feel — a skill that takes years to learn and remains variable even in experts.\n\nAdding a slipknot to the thread creates “a kind of built-in mechanical fuse” that limits how much force can be transmitted to the tissue, says Tiefeng Li, a researcher in mechanics and robotics at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, who co-led the team of mathematicians, mechanics researchers and clinicians behind the research. “The surgeon only needs to follow a very simple rule: pull until it unfurls, then you know you are at the intended force.”\n\nA simple slipknot comes undone if the thread is pulled hard enough. Credit: Chaoyang Zhao, Kaihang Zhang, Tiefeng Li\n\nThe type of knot used consists of a loop that unravels when one end of the thread is pulled. Although such knots seem simple, the mechanics inside them are complex, says Li. “When a slipknot opens, the thread bends, twists, slides and rubs against itself, and the geometry of the knot changes very quickly,” he says.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Surgeons need to tie stitches with the right tightness to help wounds heal without hurting the tissue. This skill usually takes many years to master because it depends on feeling and judging the right tension.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers developed special slipknots that can be tied into surgical thread. These knots are designed to open or “unfurl” when pulled with a specific amount of force. This means a surgeon just pulls the thread until the knot opens, ensuring the stitch is tight enough but not too tight. Tests showed that even novice surgeons could make perfect stitches using these knots. In experiments on rats, these slipknots helped wounds heal faster, with fewer leaks and less scar tissue.\n\n**Impact** – This new method acts like a built-in safety feature for stitches, making it easier and safer to sew wounds. It can reduce mistakes caused by pulling stitches too tight or too loose. This is especially helpful for new surgeons who are still learning how to judge stitch tension. The approach also has the potential to improve robotic surgery by giving machines a clear way to control stitch tightness.\n\n**What's next step** – The research team will likely work on testing these slipknots in human surgeries and developing tools or robotic systems that use them. Wider use of this technique could make surgical stitching safer and more consistent around the world.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Special slipknots programmed to open at the right force help surgeons tie safer stitches, improving healing and reducing complications.",

Cette compétence demande souvent des années d’expérience car elle repose sur le ressenti.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs ont créé des nœuds coulissants spéciaux à insérer dans le fil chirurgical. Ces nœuds s’ouvrent lorsqu’on tire dessus avec une force précise. Ainsi, le chirurgien tire jusqu’à ce que le nœud se défasse, garantissant une tension parfaite. Des tests ont montré que même les chirurgiens débutants pouvaient faire des sutures parfaites avec ces nœuds. Sur des rats, ils ont permis une guérison plus rapide, moins de fuites et moins de cicatrices.\n\n**Impact** – Cette méthode agit comme une sécurité intégrée aux sutures, facilitant et sécurisant la couture des plaies. Elle réduit les erreurs dues à des points trop serrés ou trop lâches, ce qui est très utile pour les novices. Elle pourrait aussi aider la chirurgie robotique à mieux contrôler la tension des points.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L’équipe va probablement tester ces nœuds en chirurgie humaine et développer des outils ou robots qui les utilisent.
