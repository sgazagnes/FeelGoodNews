      "content": "On a sandy riverbank, a modest school crowned with a solar-paneled roof tells a different story – one of resilience, ingenuity, and hope for the next generation.\n\nA school built for the future\n\nFor three years, the Maria Naura Gouvêa Municipal School has been living out one of COP30’s central themes: adaptation.\n\nIts flood- and erosion-resistant walls, insulated roofing, solar-powered energy systems, and satellite internet make it a rare safe haven. A 150-meter well ensures clean water – a luxury in many parts of the region.\n\nDuring our visit, Kamal Kishore, head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), called the school “a guiding light,” adding: “I would like to see at least 100,000 schools like this one across the globe.”\n\nDroughts, erosion and rising seas\n\nBarcarena’s mayor, Renato Ogawa, explained that climate impacts here are subtle, but disruptive:\n\n“The main event is the drought of rivers and streams. One week, students manage to arrive by boat; the next, because of tidal variations, they cannot reach school on time and must walk along slopes and freshwater beaches that, due to sea-level rise, have started to flood, causing erosion.”\n\nContainment walls now line the riverbanks, but Mr. Ogawa warned: “If nothing is done, over the years we will need to raise and expand that wall.”\n\nSea-level rise is also altering fish movements, threatening local diets as river water grows saltier.\n\nThese challenges have pushed Barcarena to the forefront of climate adaptation, earning it global recognition.\n\nUN News/Felipe de Carvalho For the past three years, the Maria Naura Gouvêa Municipal School, in Pará, Brazil, has been putting into practice one of the themes debated at the COP30: adapting to a world full of dangerous climate events.\n\nLocal leadership on the global stage\n\nIn 2023, Barcarena became the world’s 25th Resilience Hub – and the first in the Amazon. These UNDRR-identified hubs are cities recognized for their strong track record in disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation, and they commit to mentoring other municipalities by sharing practical solutions and expertise.\n\nUN-Habitat Executive Director Anaclaudia Rossbach stressed why COP30 must amplify voices like Mr. Ogawa’s: “We must protect people to protect the planet. And another key point is the importance of local governments, local action and local leadership.”\n\nRecognition, she added, is not enough: “It must be accompanied by solid and robust mechanisms for implementation.”\n\nUN News/Felipe de Carvalho\n\n‘An exception in the Amazon’\n\nBrazil’s Minister of Cities, Jader Filho, praised Barcarena’s progress but noted: “The school is an exception and does not reflect the educational reality of the wider Amazon. But it shows what is possible when financing and political will align.”\n\nStudents showcased projects turning cooking oil into soap, creating natural dyes from vegetables, and planting trees to combat heat.\n\nLyndisse Wandra Santos summed up their spirit: “Each tree planted is a gesture of love and hope; to adapt is to keep moving forward despite difficulties.”\n\nKamal Kishore said he was inspired by their vision: “Brazil is a success story,” he noted, citing more than 2,000 cities worldwide in the Making Cities Resilient campaign, many of them Brazilian.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nCOP30’s legacy in Barcarena\n\nMayor Ogawa revealed that COP30 has already accelerated investments: “By the end of the year, we will achieve 90 per cent sewage treatment coverage and potable water for 95 per cent of the municipality. These goals would otherwise take 10 to 15 years.”\n\nNext on his agenda: transitioning public transport boats to clean energy.\n\nUN-Habitat chief Ms. Rossbach warned that similar investments are urgently needed elsewhere, especially in housing, as millions live in precarious conditions under growing climate threats.\n\nUN News/Felipe de Carvalho\n\nFrom ‘Forest COP’ to ‘Cities COP’\n\nShe pointed to Rio’s Maré slum, where temperatures can routinely soar 6°C above the city average, based on data collected by residents themselves.\n\nHer hope is that “this Forest COP [as COP30 is billed because it is being held in Belém, Brazil, near the Amazon rainforest] must also strengthen the urban agenda, prioritizing protection for the most vulnerable.”\n\nAs COP30 unfolds in Belém, Barcarena’s story offers a powerful lesson: climate resilience begins at the local level. From solar-powered classrooms to student-led projects, this Amazon municipality shows that adaptation is not just possible – it’s already happening. And in a world facing rising seas and shifting tides, these lessons matter more than ever.\n\nUN News is reporting from Belém, bringing you front-row coverage of everything unfolding at COP30.",

Observations of post-fire carbon fluxes provide insight into the trajectory of forest recovery and its future as a carbon sink. Eddy-covariance flux towers measure high frequency greenhouse gas exchange between forests and the atmosphere, yielding measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (Reco). While flux towers are the gold standard for quantifying ecosystem scale fluxes, vegetation indices derived from remote sensing are highly correlated with tower flux data and may provide broader spatial scale understanding of how carbon fluxes vary following fire and other disturbances. The objective of our study is to examine the relationship between tower carbon flux data and NASA Landsat-derived spectral indices at five sites in the United States and Australia that were disturbed by severe fire. Specifically, we evaluated changes following fire in two Landsat-derived spectral indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), examining whether spectral indices paralleled temporal variation in NEE, GPP, and Reco. We found that the recovery of spectral indices outpaced the recovery of NEE and GPP at sites that experienced severe fire, highlighting how lags in structural and functional responses to disturbance may decouple vegetation indices from carbon fluxes. This suggests that a temporal lag should be considered when using vegetation indices as a proxy for carbon fluxes in post-fire ecosystems compared to unburned systems. This analysis represents a small snapshot of ecosystems worldwide; therefore, continuing to monitor these trends at future burned flux tower sites will be crucial to further understanding this relationship.\n\nSara Typrin\n\nCharacterizing Forest Response Pathways in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge\n\nSara Typrin, Carleton College\n\nCoastal forests along the Chesapeake Bay are rapidly becoming marshes due to sea level rise and extreme weather events. Predicting these ecosystem shifts is essential for climate adaptation responses. Previous studies have employed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series trends to characterize the resilience of coastal ecosystems; however, few have assessed NDVI variation trends within the Chesapeake Bay coastal region, where rates of sea level rise far exceed the global average. This study examines the spatial distribution of forest response pathways in relation to elevation within Maryland’s Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and the surrounding Eastern Shore region. We used the Landsat 8 record (2014-2024) to extract NDVI values for areas classified as upland forest. We calculated trends in NDVI and NDVI variation using Kendall’s τ (rank correlation) to characterize each 30m pixel into one of four ecosystem shift trajectories: abrupt transition, gradual transition, recovering, or stable. We found that 14.7% of the study area is in abrupt transition, 27.4% in gradual transition, 17.3% is in recovery, and 40.6% is stable. Mapping these regions qualitatively shows that in the BNWR, areas closer to the coast tend to experience abrupt or gradual transitions, and areas farther from the coast are typically stable or in recovery. Recovering forests have higher and more variable elevations than other pathways in a subset of BNWR’s southwest region. Future work can examine how elevation and distance to the coast relate to forest response pathways at a regional scale.\n\nAustin Jeffery\n\nStructural Characteristic Variation Between Upland Forests and Forested Wetlands\n\nAustin Jeffery, The University of Texas at Austin\n\nForested wetlands are important for regulating the Earth’s climate, cycling nutrients, and providing vital habitats, but are far less studied than upland forests. Prior work in upland forests has illustrated that canopy structural traits vary widely within and across forest types, and that these traits affect crucial ecosystem functions and services such as primary production and carbon sequestration. However, how canopy structure varies within and across forested wetlands has not been thoroughly explored. This study uses waveform lidar data collected during the 2024 SARP East flight campaigns over the Chesapeake Bay region using the LVIS (Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor) airborne platform. The LVIS Facility L2 Geolocated Surface Elevation and Canopy Height Products were used to investigate how canopy structure varies across forested wetlands and to compare canopy structural variation between forested wetlands and upland forests. To analyze the data, each lidar granule was first divided into upland and wetland forests by overlaying the granules over a USGS NLCD land use map and a USFS forest type map. Then, 20 plots were created of 100 granules each based on four tree species and whether it was an upland forest or forested wetland plot. Two upland and two wetland species were used with 5 plots each. Then, the data were used to assess variation in structural characteristics, including canopy height and vertical complexity, among forested wetlands and upland forests. The analysis resulted in a significant statistical difference between forested wetlands and upland forests structural characteristics. Additionally, forested wetlands showed a general larger variance in canopy structural complexity suggesting variation in canopy height, canopy density, layering, and forest age. This study serves as a benchmark for LiDAR-based structural characterization of forested wetlands, and informs management and conservation of forested wetlands in the mid-Atlantic region.\n\nEllery Moore\n\nArctic Ecosystem Carbon Dynamics: Comparing Greenhouse Gas Measurements in Alaska and Northern Canada Using MODIS Satellite Data and Atmospheric Flask Samples\n\nEllery Moore, Colby College\n\nAs global temperatures continue to warm, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has called attention to thawing permafrost as a potential tipping point leading to “irreversible” change to Earth’s ecosystems. Currently, permafrost holds an estimated 1,400 Pg of carbon, which will be released primarily as greenhouse gases (GHGs), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2), through microbial activity as temperatures continue to rise, thus exacerbating the atmospheric GHG effect and further warming. In Alaska and Northern Canada, permafrost underlies most of the land, with regions determined by the percentage of frozen soil: continuous (90-100%) and discontinuous (50-90%). Upon examination of spatial maps, the continuous region tends to correspond to the tundra ecosystem, and the discontinuous region to the boreal forest ecosystem. We quantified the permafrost regions using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST). In this study, we aim to determine if CO2 and CH4 concentration measurements differ between the two ecosystems using atmospheric flask samples collected during the Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) in 2017. Overall, the results showed a positive correlation between NDVI and LST, with the boreal forest characterized by higher NDVI and LST than the tundra. Additionally, higher CO2 concentrations were associated with lower NDVI and LST. However, when separating the samples into the two ecosystems, no difference was seen in their diurnal cycles. In general, CH4 measurements did not show a clear relationship with NDVI and LST, but predominantly higher measurements were seen in the tundra when separating the samples by ecosystem. The different CH4 concentrations could be influenced by other environmental sources not considered in this study, such as thermokarst lakes and anthropogenic factors. Further work to differentiate the ecosystems and confirm findings can be done by examining soil moisture samples and comparing permafrost active layer thicknesses. Additionally, to better understand the rates of carbon release, eddy covariance measurements could be examined between the tundra and boreal forest over time.\n\nRayyane Matonding\n\nSan Francisco BVOC Emissions: The Role of Urban Vegetation in HCHO/NO2 Ratios\n\nRayyane Matonding, University of San Francisco\n\nBiogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) influence local air quality, especially during summer when emissions and photochemical activity peak. BVOCs can oxidize to form ground level ozone, which poses respiratory health risks. Formaldehyde (HCHO), a key photooxidation product of BVOCs, serves as a useful proxy for biogenic emissions in remote sensing studies. Likewise, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) indicates combustion-related activity and anthropogenic VOC influence. This study examines the relationship between urban tree cover and BVOC-related ozone formation using the HCHO to NO2 photochemical regime, which reflects the balance between biogenic and anthropogenic sources. HCHO and NO2 data were obtained from NASA’s TEMPO instrument, and tree cover data from SF OpenData. San Francisco was selected due to its urban greening efforts, high anthropogenic emissions, and prevalence of invasive tree species. Two neighborhoods were selected, Sunnyside with approximately 22 percent canopy cover and Potrero Hill with approximately 2 percent canopy cover, to compare temporal trends in HCHO to NO2 ratios using time series plots. These neighborhoods were chosen based on the availability of hyperlocal weather data, which allowed for more localized atmospheric analysis. No consistent relationship between tree cover and HCHO to NO2 ratios was observed, except during 15:11 and 18:11 on June 18, 2024, which may be associated with elevated photolysis. When weather variables such as zonal wind, meridional wind, and temperature were included in the analysis, no significant correlations were found. Further research should include other cities, additional time periods, and tree species information.\n\nEmmanuel Kaiser-Veyrat\n\nVegetation Traits to Methane Fluxes: A Machine Learning Approach Across Diverse Wetlands\n\nEmmanuel Kaiser-Veyrat, Cornell University\n\nWetlands are the largest and most uncertain biological source of CH4, a greenhouse gas with 56 times the radiative forcing of CO2 over a 20-year time horizon. Given the spatiotemporal constraints of these dynamic ecosystems for consistent on-site observations, remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) offer a scalable approach to capturing the biophysical and biochemical conditions that govern CH4 exchanges. However, their reliability in wetland environments is challenged by signal saturation in dense vegetation as well as spectral mixing of water, soil, and plants. Seeking to quantify these limitations, we employ the machine learning algorithm, Random Forest Regressor (RFR), to answer the question: Can remotely sensed vegetation traits predict CH4 fluxes across freshwater and saltwater marshes? VIs from the Index DataBase are derived from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 products for Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI. The FLUXNET-CH4 Community Product yields 17 wetland sites across the contiguous U.S. with daily mean methane flux values spanning some or all of the 2011 to 2018 interval. Generalized flux footprints were computed for every site adopting a uniform approach scaling fetch with increasing measurement height. Extracting feature importances from RFR, we found the Green Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI) to consistently outperform all other indices, including two meteorological covariates measured from flux tower sites: air temperature and shortwave radiation. Grouping the VIs into five categories (moisture and water, greenness and productivity, structure and soil, pigments, and burn), we found that moisture and water indices consistently scored higher in feature importance than all other categories combined.",

Use a Reusable Water Bottle\n\nEstimated Annual Savings: $300-$1,350\n\nAmericans spend an average of $1,236 annually on single-use bottled water. By switching to a reusable water bottle, you can save significantly while keeping approximately 156 plastic bottles out of landfills each year.\n\nA quality stainless steel water bottle costs $15-50 and can last 12+ years. Over that lifetime, you could save up to $16,200 compared to buying bottled water—enough to fund a college savings account or buy a new car.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nInvest in a BPA-free stainless steel or glass water bottle\n\nInstall a tap water filter if you prefer filtered water\n\nUse refill station finders to locate free water sources when traveling\n\n3. Pack Your Lunch\n\nEstimated Annual Savings: $1,560\n\nBringing lunch to work saves money while reducing the massive amount of single-use packaging from takeout meals. At an average of $12 per meal, eating out for lunch five days a week costs about $3,120 annually. Packing lunch can cut that in half.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nGet quality reusable steel food containers and an insulated lunch bag\n\nMeal prep on Sundays to make weekday packing easier\n\nKeep reusable utensils and napkins at work\n\n4. Install a Smart Thermostat\n\nEstimated Annual Savings: $131-$200\n\nSmart thermostats like the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) and Ecobee Smart Thermostat can reduce your heating and cooling costs by 10-26%, which accounts for the largest portion of most home energy bills. The newest models learn your schedule, optimize for local weather, and can be controlled remotely.\n\nEcobee’s newest Smart Thermostat Essential ($139 at this writing) claims up to 23% savings and can pay for itself in just six months.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nCheck for utility rebates (often $50-120) before purchasing\n\nLook for ENERGY STAR certification and rebates\n\n5. Upgrade to Low-Flow Fixtures\n\nEstimated Annual Savings: $100-$150\n\nLow-flow showerheads and high-efficiency toilets significantly reduce water consumption. Modern low-flow showerheads deliver strong water pressure while using 50% less water, and newer toilets use 1.28 gallons per flush, compared with 3.5-7 gallons for older models.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nReplace old showerheads with WaterSense-labeled low-flow models\n\nLook for dual-flush toilets if replacing your commode\n\nCheck for local water utility rebates\n\n6. Use Smart Power Strips\n\nEstimated Annual Savings: $100-$165\n\n“Vampire” electronics that draw power even when turned off can account for 5-10% of residential energy use. Smart power strips automatically cut power to devices in standby mode, preventing this phantom energy drain.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nInstall smart power strips for home entertainment centers\n\nUse advanced power strips with master/controlled outlets\n\nConsider smart plugs for individual device control\n\n7. Weatherize Doors and Windows\n\nEstimated Annual Savings: $150-$200\n\nAir leaks around windows and doors can waste 10% to 30% of your heating and cooling energy. Simple weatherization improvements provide excellent return on investment.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nApply weatherstripping to doors and windows\n\nUse caulk to seal stationary cracks and gaps\n\nInstall insulating window film for older single-pane windows\n\nCheck for local weatherization assistance programs\n\n8. Drive a Fuel-Efficient Vehicle\n\nEstimated Annual Savings: $1,000-$2,000+\n\nWith average gas prices around $3.00 to $3.50 per gallon in 2025, fuel efficiency makes a significant difference to your budget. Upgrading from a 25 mpg vehicle to a 50 mpg hybrid can save a typical driver who commutes 12,000. miles a year more than $1,000 annually.\n\nThe 2025 Toyota Prius leads with 57 mpg combined, while the 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid achieves 54 mpg. Even non-hybrid options like the 2025 Honda Civic deliver an impressive 36 mpg.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nResearch fuel-efficient vehicles before your next purchase\n\nConsider hybrids or electric cars for maximum savings\n\nPractice fuel-efficient driving: maintain steady speeds, keep tires properly inflated, and remove excess weight\n\n9. Reduce Driving by One Trip Weekly\n\nEstimated Annual Savings: $250-$400\n\nEliminating just one 10-mile round-trip per week saves approximately 520 miles annually. At current gas prices and 25 mpg, that’s about 21 gallons or $70-80 in fuel costs, plus reduced maintenance and wear.\n\nAction Steps:\n\nCombine errands into single trips\n\nWork from home when possible\n\nUse carpooling apps or public transportation\n\nWalk or bike for trips under 2 miles\n\n10. Choose ENERGY STAR Appliances\n\nEstimated Annual Savings: $100-$300 (plus water savings)\n\nENERGY STAR certified appliances use 10-50% less energy than standard models. When replacing old appliances, the savings add up quickly:\n\nRefrigerators : Save 15% on energy, about $50-70/year\n\nWashing machines : Use 25% less energy and 33% less water, saving $35-50/year\n\nDishwashers : Save $50/year in energy and 5,800 gallons of water over the appliance’s lifetime\n\nDryers : Save 20% on energy costs\n\nAction Steps:\n\n11.

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nBy the time the first bell rings on Fridays in Montclair, New Jersey, something remarkable has already unfolded across town. Children burst out of their houses balancing backpacks and helmets, neighbors wave from porches, and parents gather on sidewalks as clusters of families pedal toward shared meeting points. It’s not a parade, exactly, but it certainly feels like one.\n\nWhat began three years ago as a modest experiment among five families has steadily transformed into a joyful ritual drawing hundreds. “It really started because a small group of us… just felt like it wasn’t safe,” said organizer Jessica Tillyer. Riding solo with her kids felt isolating, too, so the idea of traveling together felt both protective and comforting. Today, she says, “we can have up to 400 people riding together to school.”\n\nSecond grader Gigi Drucker summed up the appeal more simply. “The best way to get to school is by bike,” she said, because it means more exercise and because “it’s healthier for the Earth.”\n\nThe movement rolling far beyond Montclair\n\nThe magic of the bike bus isn’t limited to this New Jersey town. Hundreds of similar routes now exist across the United States and around the world, from Europe to Australia to India. According to Bike Bus World, which tracks and supports these initiatives, the appetite for these rolling school commutes has soared.\n\nCo-founder Sam Balto, who launched Portland, Oregon’s well-known bike bus, has watched interest skyrocket. He estimates that more than 400 routes operate globally, fueled by the simple insight that “children and families are craving community and physical activity and being outdoors.” When the alternative is a long car line, he added, families “naturally gravitate to something that’s super joyful and community-driven.”\n\nWhat makes a bike bus work\n\nStarting a bike bus doesn’t require much. All it takes is a few families and a willingness to try. However, sustaining one over time takes thoughtful planning and a lot of heart. Montclair’s organizers say they learned through trial, error, and plenty of pedaling.\n\nBuild a route families can trust\n\nBefore the first big group ride, organizers spent time testing different streets to find a safe path with manageable traffic. “It took us a while to come up with a route we were happy with,” said organizer Andrew Hawkins. Even now, they adjust when new families move in or traffic patterns change.\n\nCommunication helped, too. Early word spread through social media and PTA groups, eventually evolving into a dedicated chat that shares weekly updates, reminders, and photos. Along the way, families discovered an unexpected perk: kids leap out of bed faster on bike bus days. As parent Gene Gykoff put it, his child is “more excited to get out of bed for the bike bus than for the regular bus,” making it a lot easier to get him ready for school.\n\nStart with the youngest riders\n\nMontclair’s routes cover every elementary and middle school in town, with emphasis on the grades that benefit most from early biking habits. Most younger students can comfortably manage three to five miles at the group’s pace, which is about six miles per hour.\n\nThat speed is intentional. “There’s no racing on the bike bus,” Hawkins emphasized, though they sometimes split the group so older kids can stretch their legs without leaving younger riders behind.\n\nShow up in every season\n\nThe real test of a bike bus comes in winter. Rain, cold, and dark mornings require preparation and commitment. Leaders monitor forecasts, cancel only when conditions are unsafe, and remind families to bundle up with gloves, warm jackets, and neck warmers.\n\nSponsors helped Montclair secure reflective vests and bike lights for winter rides, and leaders carry tools like pumps for quick fixes. Balto notes that children adjust faster than adults. “Kids want to be outside with their friends,” he said. “If you’re going to do this in all weather, just do it consistently.”\n\nBegin small and watch it grow\n\nDespite all the organization involved, the most universal advice from seasoned leaders is simply to begin. “If you’re consistent — once a week, once a month, once a season — it will grow,” Balto said.\n\nTillyer gives newcomers the same encouragement she once needed herself: “Don’t ask for permission. Don’t worry about what it’s going to take. Find a small group of people, get on your bikes, and ride to school.” The magic, she says, happens once families experience the energy of riding together.\n\nA different kind of school morning\n\nWhat Montclair families have created isn’t just a tweak to the mundane commute to school. It’s a weekly reminder that community can shape daily life in beautiful ways. Children arrive at school a little more awake, parents feel a little more connected, and the streets are filled with the quiet hum of wheels instead of idling cars.\n\nAnd every Friday, across town and across continents, more bike buses form, proving that the simplest ideas often travel the farthest.",
