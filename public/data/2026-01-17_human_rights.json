      "summary": "In Venezuela, relatives and human-rights NGOs have stepped up calls for the immediate release of more than 800 victims of politically-motivated persecution of the government formerly led by Nicolás Maduro.",
      "content": "While the world is engaged in heated debates — both on and offline — about the legality of Donald Trump’s January 3 military airstrikes in Venezuela, relatives and friends are fighting for the full release of loved ones from unjust imprisonment in the South American country.\n\nOn January 8, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Venezuelan National Assembly (Asamblea Nacional), announced the release of a “significant number of imprisoned individuals,” as a “unilateral gesture” in the beleaguered country. However, the congressman did not provide an official release list.\n\nThose detained are considered to be “victims of politically motivated persecution” by the government formerly led by Nicolás Maduro. This is part of a “long-standing and appalling human rights record” by the leadership, according to the United Nations-commissioned Fact-Finding Mission on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which has been active since 2019.\n\nAt least 863 people fell under the aforementioned criteria, according to an ongoing, long-term vetted tally by the Foro Penal, a Venezuelan human rights NGO. They are women and men from all backgrounds, including older adults, journalists, and foreigners.\n\nHowever, as of 7.00 a.m. on January 16 (Venezuelan local time), the figures diverged on the number of released prisoners. Only 84 — out of more than their original vetted estimate of more than 800 — had been freed, according to Alfredo Romero, of Foro Penal. Half an hour later, Acting President Delcy Rodríguez set the release number to 406 during a press conference at Miraflores Palace in Caracas, the official seat of the Venezuelan presidency.\n\nNo names were provided by the acting president, who is the sister of the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez.\n\nIt all starts with the family\n\nSeveral independent advocacy groups are the protagonists of the local push for the release of Venezuelan political prisoners: the Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners in Venezuela (Comité por la Liberación de los Presos Políticos, CLIPPVE) and the Committee of Mothers for the Defense of the Truth (Comité de las Madres en Defensa de la Verdad), among others.\n\nRelatives (especially women), supporters from the general public, and even former political prisoners participate in these activities. They have also brought food and medicines to their loved ones over the years, whenever visits were allowed inside prison facilities.\n\nTheir actions are not confined to a particular political affiliation. Last year, the then-active Committee for the Defense of the Venezuelan Migrants (Comité por la Defensa de los Migrantes Venezolanos) pushed for the return of the 252 Venezuelan migrants unjustly imprisoned by the Donald Trump and Nayib Bukele administrations at El Salvador’s infamous CECOT mega prison. Followers of Nicolás Maduro are also allegedly included among the people currently considered political prisoners in Venezuela.\n\nThe power of organization\n\n“Organization is key for the defense of human rights,” said Marino Alvarado, attorney and activist, during an open meeting held in August 1, 2024 between families, human rights non-profits and press members at the Universidad Central de Venezuela in Caracas, held in the midst of the 2024 post-electoral repression.\n\n“Let’s find each other, let’s get organized, and you will be better able to support your loved ones,” Alvarado then recommended. He spoke from lived experience, as the Demanding Coordinator for the Venezuelan Program for Education and Action in Human Rights (Provea), another renowned Venezuelan human rights NGO, founded in 1988.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, those words seemed to come alive. As the press was leaving the meeting that day, a group of relatives was observed around the table, carefully speaking with Alvarado and drafting ideas on paper. Some of those faces could be found later in activities of their own as the CLIPPVE, always carrying black fabric with a constant appeal in white lettering: Liberen A Los Presos Políticos (Free the Political Prisoners).\n\nNonviolence and immense courage shape the current actions of Venezuelan advocacy groups: candlelight vigils, prayers, pages of names of their loved ones, and camaraderie. In the past, some have even seen unprovoked attacks from unidentified groups, including the Committee of Mothers near the Venezuelan Supreme Court on August 5, 2025.\n\nFamilies who are waiting near Venezuelan detention centers — confirmed releases have so far come without previous notice — now face spells of colder weather, lack of public transportation and scarce (open) support from outsiders. The fear of repressive practices by the current Delcy Rodríguez administration has not subsided.\n\nThey are soldiering on together, focusing on social media as their primary medium of communication, using hashtags such as #QueSeanTodos.\n\nFuture leaders for reconciliation?\n\nCaring for loved ones persecuted for political reasons is not a new endeavor in Venezuela and other Latin American countries.\n\nThe long-term impact — both local and international — of a human rights activist group should not be overstated. The Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo (Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo), first founded in 1977 during Argentina’s last military dictatorship, organized themselves around the need to find the missing babies and small children of disappeared activists in the South American country.\n\nThey did not just become a fully-formed NGO within Argentina, but went beyond Argentine borders. For over 30 years, the grandmothers have collaborated with scientific non-profit teams such as the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF in Spanish), in order to identify formerly abducted children through genetics. To date, 140 adults have found their original identity, thanks to the Grandmothers.\n\nThe EAAF has helped solve other international cases, including Ayotzinapa/Iguala (Mexico) and El Mozote (El Salvador) massacres.\n\nBack in Venezuela, the future aims of movements like CLIPPVE and the Committee of Mothers for the Defense of the Truth remain to be seen. However, their testimony will be a crucial step into a Venezuela that is in dire need of further work on human rights, especially on Memory, Justice and Democracy (Memoria, Justice and Democracy), as stated by Provea’s general coordinator, Oscar Murillo, on January 11:\n\nHemos tenido una semana avasallante en todos los sentidos… La historia aconseja dejar enfriar un poco las cosas para hilvanar análisis más exactos pero, sin duda, el #3Enero2026 marca el comienzo de una etapa no menos inestable y de muchas tensiones, la cual exige lo mejor de… — Oscar Murillo (@oscarfmurillo) January 12, 2026",

      "content": "Use film-style age ratings to limit teens' social media, say Lib Dems\n\n18 hours ago Share Save Kate Whannel political reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have proposed introducing film-style age ratings to limit which social media apps children can access. Under the party's plan, platforms that use addictive algorithmic feeds or host \"inappropriate content\" would be restricted to users over 16 years old, while sites with \"graphic violence or pornography\" would be rated 18-plus. This approach, the Lib Dems have argued, would \"avoid the unintended consequences\" of banning all under-16s from using social media, as advocated by the Conservatives. In recent days, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated he is open to the idea of an outright ban, telling reporters that \"all options are on the table\".\n\nHe said he would be watching to see how a ban recently introduced in Australia was working. The new Australian law, which came into force in December, requires certain social media companies including Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, X and TikTok to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep children off their platforms. In order to ascertain a user's age, the companies can use government-issued identity documents, face or voice recognition or analyse online behaviour to estimate a person's age. The Conservatives have said that, if elected, they would follow the same approach as the Australian government and ban under-16s from accessing social media. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"The internet is a Wild West, social media in particular, we don't want children to be on there.\" However, Victoria Collins, the Liberal Democrats' science and technology spokesperson, said the proposal for a \"blanket ban\" was a \"blunt instrument that doesn't work in a digital age\". She said it showed Conservatives \"just don't trust parents\". The Liberal Democrats have argued that their \"tailored approach\" would allow governments to \"quickly categorise\" newly-emerging social media platforms based on the addictiveness or harmfulness of their content. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Our message to social media giants is clear: if your platform spreads harmful content or relies on addictive and harmful algorithms, you should not be allowed anywhere near our children. \"This issue cannot be kicked down the road any longer.\"",

Some politicians want to ban all users under 16 from social media, but this has raised concerns about fairness and effectiveness.\n\n**What happened** – The Liberal Democrats suggested using age ratings like those for movies to decide which social media apps children can use. Apps with addictive features or some bad content would be for users 16 and older. Apps showing graphic violence or adult content would be for 18 and older. This idea aims to be more precise than a total ban.\n\n**Impact** – This plan tries to protect young people from harmful online content while still letting them use safer apps.

Let us open all embassies of EU countries in Iran as shelters, so that the peaceful demonstrators can find refuge there,” said the head of the conservative European People’s Party (EPP) group in the European Parliament to the newspaper “Bild”. “The deadly violence of the mullah regime against peaceful demonstrators cannot be justified in any way.

Iran’s security apparatus is systematically cracking down on the mass protests. The protests have now subsided. (January 14)",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many people in Iran have been protesting against their government, but these protests have been met with violence. Over 2,500 protesters have died, and the security forces are cracking down hard on those who speak out.\n\n**What happened** – Manfred Weber, leader of the European People's Party (EPP) in the European Parliament, suggested that the remaining European Union (EU) embassies in Iran should open their doors to protect these protesters. This means the embassies would act as safe places where people can find refuge from danger. Roberta Metsola, the President of the European Parliament, also called for stronger support from EU countries and banned Iranian officials from entering the Parliament building.\n\n**Impact** – This idea is important because it offers a real way to help people facing violence. Embassies are usually protected by international law, so they can provide safety where other places cannot. By turning embassies into shelters, the EU shows it is willing to take concrete steps to protect human rights and support peaceful protesters.\n\n**What's next step** – The EU member countries will need to discuss and decide if they will agree to open their embassies as safe havens. If they do, the embassies will prepare to welcome and protect people in danger, which could save many lives and send a strong message against violence.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – EU leaders propose turning embassies in Iran into safe places to protect protesters facing violence from their government.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – De nombreuses personnes en Iran manifestent contre leur gouvernement, mais ces manifestations sont violemment réprimées. Plus de 2 500 manifestants ont perdu la vie, et les forces de sécurité agissent durement contre ceux qui s’expriment.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Manfred Weber, chef du Parti populaire européen (PPE) au Parlement européen, a proposé que les ambassades restantes de l’Union européenne (UE) en Iran ouvrent leurs portes pour protéger ces manifestants. Cela signifie que les ambassades agiraient comme des lieux sûrs où les gens peuvent trouver refuge contre le danger. Roberta Metsola, présidente du Parlement européen, a également demandé un soutien plus fort des pays de l’UE et a interdit aux représentants iraniens d’entrer dans le bâtiment du Parlement.\n\n**Impact** – Cette idée est importante car elle offre un moyen concret d’aider les personnes qui subissent la violence. Les ambassades sont généralement protégées par le droit international, elles peuvent donc offrir une sécurité là où d’autres lieux ne le peuvent pas. En transformant les ambassades en refuges, l’UE montre qu’elle est prête à agir pour protéger les droits humains et soutenir les manifestants pacifiques.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les pays membres de l’UE devront discuter et décider s’ils acceptent d’ouvrir leurs ambassades comme refuges. S’ils le font, les ambassades se prépareront à accueillir et protéger les personnes en danger, ce qui pourrait sauver de nombreuses vies et envoyer un message fort contre la violence.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Les dirigeants de l’UE proposent de transformer les ambassades en Iran en lieux sûrs pour protéger les manifestants victimes de violences de leur gouvernement.",
