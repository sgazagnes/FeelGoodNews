      "title": "Why saving microbes may be the most important conservation effort ever",
      "summary": "Researchers have launched the first coordinated plan to protect microbial biodiversity, calling attention to the “invisible 99% of life” that drives essential Earth systems. The IUCN has formally recognized this effort through the creation of the Microbial Conservation Specialist Group. By developing new metrics, policies, and restoration tools, scientists aim to make microbial life a core part of global conservation action. The roadmap also outlines upcoming goals such as microbial hotspot maps and new microbe-based conservation solutions.",
      "content": "A newly released study describes how researchers collaborated to design the first comprehensive roadmap for protecting microbial life. The effort was led by Professor Jack Gilbert, President of Applied Microbiology International.\n\nThe work appears in the article titled 'Safeguarding Microbial Biodiversity: Microbial Conservation Specialist Group (MCSG) within the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)', published in Sustainable Microbiology, an AMI journal.\n\nLaunching a New Global Effort Through the IUCN\n\nIn July 2025, the IUCN formally created the MCSG within its Species Survival Commission. The group is co-chaired by Professor Gilbert and Raquel Peixoto (KAUST / ISME). Its formation followed a May workshop led by Professor Gilbert that brought together conservation specialists and microbiologists to explore how traditional conservation goals apply in a world driven by microbial processes.\n\n\"This is the first global coalition dedicated to safeguarding microbial biodiversity, which is the 'invisible 99% of life', to ensure that microbes are recognized as essential to the planet's ecological, climate, and health systems,\" Professor Gilbert said.\n\nHe added: \"I think this reframes conservation from saving individual species to preserving the networks of invisible life that make visible life possible -- a paradigm shift toward planetary health. It also gives us a really good look into the microbial tools that can support conservation action -- so that we may use microbiology to solve the world's biggest problems.\"\n\nWhy Microbial Biodiversity Matters for the Planet\n\nMicrobes are central to soil fertility, carbon cycling, marine productivity, and the health of plants and animals. Despite this, they rarely appear in conservation policy. Professor Gilbert noted that overlooking microbial diversity weakens climate resilience, food security, and ecosystem restoration efforts. He explained: \"The MCSG fills this gap by embedding microbiology directly into IUCN's conservation machinery, i.e. using Red List criteria, ecosystem assessments, and restoration programs, to make microbes visible in policy, not just in science.\"\n\nBuilding a Global Network to Guide Microbial Conservation\n\nOver the past two years, the founding members have assembled an international community of microbiologists, ecologists, legal experts, and Indigenous knowledge holders from more than 30 countries. Together, they created the first microbial conservation roadmap, outlining five core components of the IUCN Species Conservation Cycle:\n\nAssessment -- develop Red List-compatible metrics for microbial communities and biobanks.\n\n-- develop Red List-compatible metrics for microbial communities and biobanks. Planning -- create ethical and economic frameworks for microbial interventions.\n\n-- create ethical and economic frameworks for microbial interventions. Action -- pilot restoration projects using microbial solutions (coral probiotics, soil carbon microbiomes, pathogen-resistant wildlife).\n\n-- pilot restoration projects using microbial solutions (coral probiotics, soil carbon microbiomes, pathogen-resistant wildlife). Networking -- connect scientists, culture collections, and Indigenous custodians worldwide.\n\n-- connect scientists, culture collections, and Indigenous custodians worldwide. Communication & Policy -- launch public and policy campaigns, including \"Invisible but Indispensable.\"\n\nEarly work is supported by funding from the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation, along with in kind support from AMI and ISME. This first phase focuses on mapping microbial hotspots, building conservation indices, and linking existing microbial biobanks into a coordinated global archive.\n\nOvercoming Scientific and Ethical Challenges\n\nProfessor Gilbert explained that creating a conservation framework for microscopic life comes with complex scientific and conceptual barriers. These challenges include:\n\nDetermining what qualifies as a \"microbial species\" within Red List criteria.\n\nIntegrating genomic and ecological information into systems originally developed for plants and animals.\n\nAddressing the belief that microbes are too resilient or too complicated to require protection.\n\n\"Microbial conservation must contend with enormous unseen diversity and highly dynamic community structures that defy classical species concepts. Taxonomic instability, lack of long-term baselines, and the ethical handling of microbial samples (including Indigenous or human-associated microbiota) all require new definitions of 'loss', 'restoration', and 'rights of microbes',\" he said.\n\nHe added, \"But a major landmark came when the IUCN approved the MCSG as a formal Specialist Group -- officially extending global conservation to microbes for the first time.\"\n\nPlans for the Next Phase of Conservation Work\n\nThe group's upcoming goals include:\n\nDeveloping the first Microbial Red List framework by 2027.\n\nCreating global maps of microbial hotspots across soil, marine, and host-associated systems.\n\nTesting conservation strategies such as microbial bioremediation, coral probiotics, and soil carbon restoration.\n\nEnsuring microbial indicators are incorporated alongside plants and animals in IUCN and UN biodiversity targets by 2030.\n\nWhat Is Needed for Long-Term Progress\n\nSustained investment will be essential to expand global microbial monitoring networks. Future progress also depends on integrating microbes into national biodiversity and climate strategies, including \"30 by 30\" and One Health policies. Another key priority is building \"public microbial literacy -- recognizing microbes as the foundation of ecosystem and human health.\" The roadmap also highlights the importance of digital-twin and AI tools to anticipate how microbial communities will respond to environmental change.\n\nThe paper was published today (November 20) in Sustainable Microbiology.",

      "summary": "MIT engineers have created an ultrasonic device that rapidly frees water from materials designed to absorb moisture from the air. Instead of waiting hours for heat to evaporate the trapped water, the system uses high-frequency vibrations to release droplets in just minutes. It can be powered by a small solar cell and programmed to cycle continuously throughout the day. The breakthrough could help communities with limited access to fresh water.",
      "content": "Feeling thirsty? It may be possible to draw clean water directly from the air around us. Even extremely dry regions contain small amounts of humidity, and certain materials can soak up that moisture and release it as usable drinking water. Over the past several years, researchers have created a range of sponge-like materials that make this type of \"atmospheric water harvesting\" possible.\n\nExtracting the captured water usually involves heat -- and a long wait. Most current systems rely on sunlight to warm these materials until the trapped moisture evaporates and condenses into liquid. This slow step can take many hours or even stretch into days.\n\nMIT engineers have now identified a much faster method for recovering this water. Instead of relying on solar heating, the team uses ultrasonic vibrations that shake the moisture loose.\n\nUltrasonic Vibrations Offer a Faster Alternative\n\nThe researchers created a high-frequency ultrasonic device that vibrates rapidly. When a water-absorbing material, or \"sorbent,\" sits on top of the device, it sends out ultrasound waves tuned to break the bonds holding water molecules in place. Their tests showed that this approach frees the water within minutes, while heat-driven systems typically require tens of minutes or several hours.\n\nBecause it does not use heat, the device needs a power source. The team suggests that a small solar cell could supply electricity and also act as a sensor to detect when the material is saturated. The system could even be set to activate automatically whenever enough water has accumulated. Such automation would allow the setup to collect and release water repeatedly throughout the day.\n\nA Step Toward Practical Air-to-Water Systems\n\n\"People have been looking for ways to harvest water from the atmosphere, which could be a big source of water particularly for desert regions and places where there is not even saltwater to desalinate,\" says Svetlana Boriskina, principal research scientist in MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering. \"Now we have a way to recover water quickly and efficiently.\"\n\nBoriskina and her coauthors describe the device in a study published on November 18 in Nature Communications. The paper was led by first author Ikra Iftekhar Shuvo, an MIT graduate student in media arts and sciences, along with Carlos Díaz-Marín, Marvin Christen, Michael Lherbette, and Christopher Liem.\n\nImproving Atmospheric Water Harvesting\n\nBoriskina's research group develops materials that interact with environmental conditions in innovative ways. Recently, they explored atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) and how materials can be engineered to pull moisture from the air efficiently. The long-term goal is to provide a reliable source of drinking water for communities that lack both freshwater and saltwater supplies.\n\nLike many other teams, they initially assumed that AWH systems placed outdoors would take in moisture overnight and then rely on sunlight during the day to release it through evaporation and condensation.\n\n\"Any material that's very good at capturing water doesn't want to part with that water,\" Boriskina explains. \"So you need to put a lot of energy and precious hours into pulling water out of the material.\"\n\nA New Direction Sparked by Ultrasound Research\n\nThe idea for a faster method emerged after Ikra Shuvo joined the group. Shuvo had been working with ultrasound for wearable medical devices, and during discussions with Boriskina, they realized that ultrasonic vibrations might dramatically speed the water-release step in atmospheric water harvesting.\n\n\"It clicked: We have this big problem we're trying to solve, and now Ikra seemed to have a tool that can be used to solve this problem,\" Boriskina recalls.\n\nHow Ultrasound Shakes Water Free\n\nUltrasound refers to acoustic pressure waves that exceed 20 kilohertz (20,000 cycles per second). These high-frequency waves are invisible and inaudible to humans. The team found that at the right frequency, ultrasound can shake water molecules free from the material holding them.\n\n\"With ultrasound, we can precisely break the weak bonds between water molecules and the sites where they're sitting,\" Shuvo says. \"It's like the water is dancing with the waves, and this targeted disturbance creates momentum that releases the water molecules, and we can see them shake out in droplets.\"\n\nDesigning a High-Frequency Actuator\n\nShuvo and Boriskina built an ultrasonic actuator specifically for atmospheric water harvesting. At its center is a flat ceramic ring that vibrates when voltage is applied. Around it is another ring containing tiny nozzles. As droplets shake loose, they fall through the nozzles into collection containers placed above and below the vibrating ring.\n\nThe team tested the device using previously developed AWH materials. They placed small, quarter-sized pieces of the sorbent in a humidity chamber at different humidity levels until each sample became fully saturated. Each sample was then placed on the actuator and vibrated at ultrasonic frequencies. In every test, the actuator released enough moisture to dry the material within minutes.\n\nEfficiency Gains and Practical Potential\n\nThe researchers estimate that the ultrasonic method is 45 times more efficient than relying on solar heat when extracting water from the same material.\n\n\"The beauty of this device is that it's completely complementary and can be an add-on to almost any sorbent material,\" Boriskina says. She imagines a household system that uses a fast-absorbing material paired with an ultrasonic actuator, each roughly the size of a window. When the material becomes saturated, the actuator would briefly activate using power from a solar cell, shake out the water, and then reset for another cycle.\n\n\"It's all about how much water you can extract per day,\" she says. \"With ultrasound, we can recover water quickly, and cycle again and again. That can add up to a lot per day.\"\n\nThis work was supported, in part, by the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab and the MIT-Israel Zuckerman STEM Fund.",

      "title": "This pig’s bacon was delicious. But she’s alive and well.",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "I’m eating Dawn the Yorkshire pig and she’s quite tasty. But don’t worry. She’s doing perfectly fine, traipsing around a sanctuary in upstate New York. (Word is that she appreciates belly rubs and sunshine.) I’m in San Francisco, at an Italian joint just south of Golden Gate Park, enjoying meatballs and bacon not made of meat in the traditional sense but of plants mixed with “cultivated” pork fat. Dawn, you see, donated a small sample of fat, which a company called Mission Barns got to proliferate in devices called bioreactors by providing nutrients like carbohydrates, amino acids, and vitamins — essentially replicating the conditions in her body. Because so much of the flavor of pork and other meats comes from the animal’s fat, Mission Barns can create products like sausages and salami with plants but make them taste darn near like sausages and salami.\n\n\n\nI’ve been struggling to describe the experience, because cultivated meat short-circuits my brain — my mouth thinks I’m eating a real pork meatball, but my brain knows that it’s fundamentally different and that Dawn (that’s her pictured above) didn’t have to die for it. This is the best I’ve come up with: It’s Diet Meat. Just as Diet Coke is an approximation of the real thing, so too are cultivated meatballs. They simply taste a bit less meaty, at least to my tongue. Which is understandable, as the only animal product in this food is the bioreactor-grown fat.\n\n\n\nCultivated pork is the newest entrant in the effort to rethink meat. For years, plant-based offerings have been mimicking burgers, chicken, and fish with ever-more convincing blends of proteins and fats. Mission Barns is one of a handful of startups taking the next step: growing real animal fat outside the animal, then marrying it with plants to create hybrids that look, cook, and taste more like what consumers have always eaten, easing the environmental and ethical costs of industrial livestock. The company says it’s starting with pork because it’s a large market and products like bacon are fat-rich, but its technology is “cell-agnostic,” meaning it could create beef and chicken, too.\n\nMatt Simon\n\nHonestly, Mission Barns’ creations taste great, in part because they’re “unstructured,” in the parlance of the industry. A pork loin is a complicated tangle of fat, muscle cells, and connective tissues that is very difficult — and expensive — to replicate, but a meatball, salami, or sausage incorporates other ingredients. That allows Mission Barns to experiment with what plant to use as a base, to which they add spices to accentuate the flavors. It’s a technology that they can iterate, basically, crafting ever-better meats by toying with ingredients in different ratios.\n\n\n\nSo the bacon I ate, for instance, had a nice applewood smoke to it. The meatballs had the springiness you’d expect. During a later visit to Mission Barns’ headquarters across town, I got to try two prototypes of its salami as well — both were spiced like you’d expect but less elastic, so they chewed a bit more easily than what you’d find on a charcuterie board. (The sensation of food in the mouth is known in the industry as “mouthfeel,” and nailing it is essential to the success of alt meats.) The salami slices even left grease stains on the paper they were served on — Dawn’s own little mark on the world.\n\nYour support powers solutions-focused climate reporting — keeping it free for everyone.

While Mission Barns has so far only sold its products at that Italian restaurant and, for a limited time, at a grocery store in Berkeley — $13.99 for a pack of eight meatballs, similar to higher-end products from organic and regenerative farms — it is fixing to scale up production and sell the technology to other companies to produce more cultivated foods. (It is assessing how big the bioreactors will have to be to reach price parity with traditional meat products.) The idea is to provide an alternative to animal agriculture, which uses a whole lot of land, water, and energy to raise creatures and ship their flesh around the world. Livestock are responsible for between 10 and 20 percent of humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions — depending on who’s estimating it — and that’s to say nothing of the cruelty involved in keeping pigs and chickens and cows in unsavory, occasionally inhumane, conditions.\n\n\n\nGetting animal cells to grow outside of an animal, though, ain’t easy. For one, if cells don’t have anything to attach to, they die. So Mission Barns’ cultivator uses a spongelike structure, full of nooks and crannies that provides lots of surface area for the cells to grow. “We have our media, which is just the nutrient solution that we give to these cells,” said Saam Shahrokhi, chief technology officer at Mission Barns. “We’re essentially recapitulating all of the environmental cues that make cells inside the body grow fat, [but] outside the body.” While Dawn’s fat is that of a Yorkshire pig, Shahrokhi said they could easily produce fat from other breeds like the Mangalitsa, known as the Kobe beef of pork. (In June, the company won approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to bring its cultivated fat to market.)\n\nFat in hand, Mission Barns can mix it with plant proteins. If you’re familiar with Impossible Foods, it uses soy to replicate the feel and look of ground beef and adds soy leghemoglobin, which is similar to the heme that gives meat its meaty flavor. Depending on the flavor and texture it’s trying to copy, Mission Bay uses pea protein for the meatballs and sausages, wheat for the bacon, and fava beans for the salami. “The plant-based meat industry has done pretty well with texture,” said Bianca Le, head of special projects at Mission Barns. “I think what they’re really missing is flavor and juiciness, which obviously is where the fat comes in.”\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nMatt Simon\n\nBut the fat is just the beginning. Mission Barns’ offerings not only have to taste good, but also can’t have an off-putting smell when they’re coming out of the package and when they’re cooking. The designers have to dial in the pH, which could degrade the proteins if not balanced. How the products behave on the stove or in the oven has to be familiar, too. “If someone has to relearn how to cook a piece of bacon or a meatball, then it’s never going to work,” said Zach Tyndall, the product development and culinary manager at Mission Barns.\n\n\n\nWhen I pick up that piece of salami, it has to feel like the real thing, in more ways than one. Indeed, it’s greasy in the hand and has that tang of cured meat. It’s even been through a dry-aging process to reduce its moisture. “We treat this like we would a conventional piece of salami,” Tyndall said.\n\nCultivated meat companies may also go more unconventional. “I also love the idea of taking their pork fat and putting it in a beef burger — what would happen if you did that?” said Barb Stuckey, chief new product strategy officer at Mattson, a food developer that has worked with many cultivated meat companies. “Mixing species, it’s not something we typically do. But with this technology, we can.”\n\nOf course, in this new frontier of food, the big question is: Who exactly is this for? Would a vegetarian or vegan eat cultured pork fat if it’s divorced from the cruelty of factory farming? Would meat-eaters be willing to give up the real thing for a facsimile? Mission Barns’ market research, Le said, found that its early adopters are actually flexitarians — people who eat mostly plant-based but partake in the occasional animal product. But Le adds that their first limited sale to the public in Berkeley included some people who called themselves vegetarians and vegans.\n\nMission Barns\n\nThere’s also the matter of quantifying how much of an environmental improvement cultivated fat might offer over industrial pork production. If scaled up, one benefit of cultivated food might be that companies can produce the stuff in more places — that is, instead of sprawling pig farms and slaughterhouses being relegated to rural areas, bioreactors could be run in cities, cutting down on the costs and emissions associated with shipping. Still, those factories would need energy to grow fat cells, though they could be run on renewable electricity. “We modeled our process at the large commercial scale, and then compared it to U.S. bacon production,” Le said. (The company would not offer specific details, saying it is in the process of patenting its technique.) “And we found that with renewable energy, we do significantly better in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.”\n\n\n\nWhether or not consumers bite, though, remains to be seen. The market for meat alternatives in the U.S. has majorly softened of late: Beyond Meat, which makes plant-based products like burgers and sausages, has seen revenues drop significantly, in part because of consumers’ turn away from processed foods. But by licensing its technology elsewhere, Mission Barns’ strategy is to break into new markets beyond the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe challenges of cultivated meat go beyond the engineering once you get to the messaging and branding — telegraphing to consumers that they’re buying something that may in fact be partially meat. “When you buy chicken, you get 100 percent chicken,” Stuckey said. “I think a lot of people go into cultivated meat thinking what’s going to come onto the market is 100 percent cultivated chicken, and it’s not going to be that. It’s going to be something else.”\n\n\n\nRegardless of the trajectory of cultivated fat products, Dawn will continue mingling with llamas, soaking up the sunshine, and getting belly rubs in upstate New York — even as she makes plants taste more like pork.\n\n\n\n",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Traditional meat production uses many resources and causes animal suffering. Scientists and companies are working to create meat alternatives that taste like real meat but are better for the environment and animals.\n\n**What happened** – A company called Mission Barns developed a way to grow real pig fat outside the animal using a small sample from a pig named Dawn. This fat is grown in special machines called bioreactors and then mixed with plant proteins to make products like bacon, meatballs, and salami. These foods taste very similar to real pork but don’t require killing pigs.\n\n**Impact** – This method offers a new way to produce meat that keeps the flavor and juiciness of pork while using fewer natural resources and avoiding animal cruelty. Because fat is a big part of meat’s taste, growing real fat cells helps make plant-based foods taste more like traditional meat. This could reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to farming animals and change how meat is made.\n\n**What's next step** – Mission Barns plans to increase production and share its technology with other companies. They are working to make these products more affordable and available in more places. They also want to explore making other meats like beef and chicken using the same technology.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Mission Barns’ cultivated pork fat creates tasty meat products that don’t require harming animals and could help reduce the environmental impact of meat production.",

      "summary": "From citizen initiatives and artistic engagement to public policies, Guadeloupe is reinventing itself, turning waste into a resource — but there is still an urgent need to improve waste recovery channels.",
      "content": "Between citizen initiatives, artistic engagement, and public policies, Guadeloupe is reinventing itself to turn waste into a resource. From sewing workshops to sustainable festivals, the entire archipelago is mobilising for a more sustainable future.\n\nAccording to the latest data published by ORDEC, Guadeloupe’s regional waste and circular economy observatory, in 2023, the country produced 346,720 tonnes of waste. A quarter of this was recovered; the remaining 60 percent was buried in two non-hazardous waste storage facilities. While waste production in the territory has remained stable since 2019, there is an urgent need to improve waste recovery channels.\n\nWhen creation becomes ecological resistance\n\nFor some Guadeloupeans, the act of creating is also becoming an act of ecological resistance. Where some see nothing but scraps, artists and craftspeople have decided to transform waste into creative material. New hybrid spaces are emerging, giving a second life to materials that were destined for the dustbin, in a conscious process that is at once aesthetic, social and sustainable.\n\nFor instance, when you arrive at l’Admérane — a creative space located in the former refectory of Ilet Pérou in Capesterre-Belle-Eau — you’re immediately immersed in a creative universe of murals, upcycled furniture, rows of sewing machines and racks of clothes with original cuts and patterns.\n\n“At l’Admérane, individuals bring us their clothes. We wash and sort them. Some pieces go into our small thrift shop, but we focus mainly on upcycling, the creative aspect. We raise public awareness by showing them what can be done with this textile “waste,” explains Béatrice Souillet, president of Le Nouveau Mode, the association behind the creation of this space dedicated to the circular economy. “Either we teach you how to upcycle them, or we can take care of it. The aim is to take the old and make the beautiful.”\n\nL'Admérane welcomes fashion entrepreneurs and RSO beneficiaries who come to learn sewing skills, and also offers awareness-raising workshops for schoolchildren and professionals. The workplace has even entered into a partnership with leading telecommunications operator, Orange Caraïbe. The team recovers discarded items, such as old banners, and gives them a second life and also conducts workshops for company staff in Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana.\n\n“Fashion is the second most polluting sector in the world. We must therefore adopt responsible consumption,” maintains Souillet. “In Guadeloupe, certain initiatives have been set up to recover textile ‘waste,’ but while some of it is processed in the archipelago, much of the clothing collected is still sent to mainland France or Africa. We have to process our textile waste ourselves. Recovering this waste creates jobs.”\n\nFighting against fast fashion\n\nHowever, designers of upcycled products face another problem: fast fashion. “We can't recycle poor-quality materials. There used to be fast fashion, but ultra-fast fashion, with [the rise of] sites like Shein and Temu, generates poor-quality materials, sometimes even dangerous to health and the environment,” she continues. For Souillet, it is therefore necessary to communicate more effectively with the general public and explain that, rather than buying several garments of poor quality at low prices, it is better to pay a little more for a garment that will last.\n\nSupported by the Conseil Départemental de la Guadeloupe and having won several awards, l’Admérane recently became a PTCE — a territorial cluster for economic cooperation. At the same time, Souillet has created her own brand, Cyrikaë, based on a firm commitment to environmental awareness.\n\nArt as a response to overconsumption\n\nThe work of artist and eco-designer Guy Gabon, meanwhile, is based on reuse and transformation. To her, being an eco-designer means rejecting the use of raw materials in favour of secondary materials — those that have already had a first life. It is a choice that became clear to her as she observed her environment and its rapid degradation. Faced with the proliferation of waste and the spiral of overconsumption, she realised the urgent need to take action against a system that produces disposable objects, often made from materials that last much longer than their intended use.\n\nIn Gabon’s practice, no material is predetermined: metal, plastic, textiles; it all depends on the message or form she wishes to express. This self-imposed constraint is, in her view, a necessary condition for reducing waste production. “You can’t have it all,” she says, convinced that the ecological transition will involve a degree of discomfort and sacrifice.\n\nTwenty years after embarking on this path, Gabon has noticed a change in attitudes, though she still considers the pace of that change to be slow. Despite persistent resistance, environmental awareness is growing globally. “We have to change the way we live in the world,” she insists, calling for patience and determination to bring about lasting behavioral change.\n\nMore responsible festivals\n\nIn the events sector, too, efforts are being made to improve waste management. Some festivals can produce dozens of tons of waste, which is why more and more organisers are adopting policies to reduce and sort waste. The aim is to avoid waste at source by reducing the consumption of disposable or single-use products, implementing a responsible purchasing policy, raising stakeholder awareness, and enabling waste sorting during events.\n\nBefore and during each event, organisers carry out awareness campaigns among staff and festival-goers to encourage them to consume differently. They may provide, for example, reusable cups and washable tableware, opt for glass or keg containers, limit the use of plastic bottles, and promote food composting. Dedicated areas for raising awareness are also established within exhibitor villages.\n\nThe management of waste at festivals is often entrusted to associations like Mouvances Caraïbes, which specialises in environmental education and sustainable development, and works to raise awareness of these issues. Through friendly initiatives, the association aims to inform the public about a new way of living that is fairer, more rewarding, more environmentally friendly, and more collaborative.\n\nFor seven years now, François Vatin has been working with associations like these as an event waste manager, and joined Mouvances Caraïbes a year ago. During festivals, he coordinates waste management and communication between public bodies, organisers, exhibitors, and service providers. Nevertheless, in nearly a decade, the engineer has struggled to see any improvement in practices. Instead, he says that while many people want to adopt a responsible policy, cost remains a barrier, particularly for small organisers with limited finances.\n\nIn a sector where budgets fluctuate from one event to the next, depending on subsidies and various partnerships, the slightest reduction in funding inevitably leads to a reduction in actions. For Vatin, this reduction is often to the detriment of actions aimed at preserving the environment, and he deplores certain popular beliefs that persist. “People tell us they no longer sort their waste. They think it’s pointless. But in Guadeloupe, there are more and more trash cans, so progress is being made,” he says. “Overall, more and more sectors are developing and more people are getting involved. We can no longer hide behind this argument. Now it depends on people’s willingness.”\n\nTowards a zero-waste archipelago\n\nOn the public sector side, waste management is a priority. The Regional Council of Guadeloupe has set a goal of making the archipelago a zero-waste territory by 2035.\n\nSince 2016, all the municipalities in Guadeloupe have transferred their waste treatment responsibilities to a public, inter-municipal cooperation — basically a joint association known as EPCI, through which new waste treatment and recovery facilities have been created.\n\nIn this vein, an energy recovery plant is expected to open in Guadeloupe in 2028. The project, estimated at EUR 96 million (just over USD 111 million), should enable waste to be incinerated and contribute to electricity production. However, there is still much to be done to achieve the objectives.\n\nThis is a long-term, collective effort on a regional scale, which is why, in September 2024, following a meeting between representatives of the French territories in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic, Dominica, and Saint Lucia, an agreement was signed. The Zero Waste in the Caribbean project, led by the waste recovery union Syvade and financed by INTERREG Caribbean, aims to pool knowledge and develop waste recovery sectors throughout the Caribbean.",
