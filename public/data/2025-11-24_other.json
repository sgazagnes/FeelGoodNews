      "title": "From milking stalls to mobile apps: UN-supported project powers rural revival in Indonesia",
      "summary": "In the rolling hills of Indonesia’s West Java province, thousands of farmers are reaping tangible benefits from the digitization of their businesses and improved access to finance, thanks in part to a United Nations‑supported project.",
      "content": "Members of the South Bandung Farming Cooperative (KPBS) have recorded a 38 per cent increase in productive loans and a 43 per cent rise in sales volumes over the past two years, following the introduction of a new business app.\n\n“Easier access to financing means higher loan volumes, which in turn means more cattle and higher income for our farmers,” said Head of KBPS Aun Gunawan. “This is how financial inclusion leads to improved livelihoods.”\n\nUN Indonesia/Miklos Gaspar Dairy farmers in Indonesia are using a new business-focused app which is helping them to boost sales.\n\nFounded in 1969, KPBS has 5,000 members and produces 70,000 tons of milk a day. The cooperative operates its own dairy plant, using around 15 per cent of its milk production to manufacture yoghurt and mozzarella cheese, while the remainder is sold to dairy companies in the region.\n\nIn addition, the cooperative runs a hospital, veterinary service, and a bank—all designed to support members and enhance their well‑being and competitiveness.\n\nHolistic and healthy\n\n\"We take a holistic approach, and for us it is all about health—not only the health of farmers and their cattle, but also financial health,” Mr Gunawan explained to the heads of United Nations agencies in Indonesia, who visited KPBS as part of their annual Leadership Dialogue on shaping the UN’s trajectory in the country.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) is now supporting the cooperative in implementing this vision, leveraging digitization to strengthen financial inclusion. The project is implemented in cooperation with the Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) and the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs.\n\nUN Indonesia/Miklos Gaspar A worker checks the pH of semi-fermented milk as part of the cheese-productioin process.\n\n“KPBS was already a strong, well‑managed business before our involvement,” said Simrin Singh, ILO Country Director for Indonesia and Timor‑Leste. “The tools we have provided have catalyzed further improvements and enhanced livelihoods.”\n\nThrough the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system business app – introduced by the ILO under a project funded by the Government of Switzerland – farmers can now track their income and expenses, including the cost of fodder provided by the cooperative.\n\nThey also have 24/7 access to the cooperative’s veterinarians, who can reach farms within 30 minutes.\n\nThe app records individual animals’ veterinary data, including vaccination schedules, enabling milk collection points to segregate milk from recently vaccinated cows. If mixed with regular milk, such milk could reduce the day’s overall quality—and therefore the selling price.\n\nHigher volume, better price\n\n“These practical improvements have contributed not only to higher volumes but also to better prices per litre sold,” Mr Gunawan said.\n\nThe most significant impact, however, has been improved access to finance. The cooperative has operated its own bank since 1993 to provide farmers with credit.\n\nWith the ERP system, loan applications have become simpler and more accessible, Ms Singh explained. The bank can now view farmers’ financial data – income, liquidity, and outstanding debt – directly through the system, resulting in a higher rate of approved applications.\n\nApplications have also increased. With the integrated ERP tool, farmers no longer need to travel and queue to complete forms; they can apply directly through the app, where their financial history is already recorded and available to the lending team.\n\nUN Indonesia/Miklos Gaspar Dairy cows feed at a farm in Pangalengan, in West Jave, Indonesia.\n\n“This may sound like a matter of convenience, but it is far more than that,” said dairy farmer Encih Mintarsih. “Farmers cannot easily leave their cattle for half a day, let alone multiple times, to submit an application that may not even be approved.\n\n“Now we can apply online and spend our time productively. That makes us far more likely to pursue financing,” she added.\n\nTowards food self‑sufficiency\n\nProgrammes like this have broader national relevance: strengthening domestic food production and self‑reliance is a top priority for the Government of Indonesia.\n\nThe country currently imports around 80 per cent of its dairy products. Enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of local milk producers contributes directly to national self‑sufficiency goals.\n\nIt also provides a model for inclusive rural economic growth.\n\n“In an upper‑middle‑income country like Indonesia, the digital transformation of the economy and improved access to finance are essential for progressing toward high‑income status,” said Gita Sabharwal, UN Resident Coordinator in Indonesia. “For this reason, in close consultation with the Government, digitalization and access to finance are key priorities of the new cooperation framework between the UN and Indonesia.”\n\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), signed in August 2025 and aligned with the SDGs and Indonesia’s national development agenda, outlines how the UN will contribute to three transformative outcomes in the country, including Economic and Digital Transformation.\n\n“This outstanding programme by the ILO demonstrates how the UN can complement the Government’s efforts to accelerate inclusive development using modern technology,” Ms Sabharwal said.\n\nThe project contributes directly to OJK’s Rural Bank Transformation Blueprint, strengthens the inclusive financial ecosystem model, and supports the efforts of the National Committee on Financial Literacy and Inclusion to improve financial literacy and inclusion. It also aligns with national priorities to digitize small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and boost productivity through digital tools.\n\n“In Indonesia, 90 per cent of jobs are created by SMEs – so improving their competitiveness is critical to ensuring decent work,” Ms Singh said.\n\nThe intent is for this approach to be rolled out more widely across the country.\n\nWhat advice does Mr Gunawan have for other cooperatives and policymakers? “Show farmers clear and tangible benefits, and they will quickly adopt digital technologies,” he said.\n\n“Buzzwords like ‘digitization’ and ‘financial inclusion’ must be translated into their daily reality – just as we have done here with the support of the ILO and the UN.”",

      "title": "A mysterious metal find in Sweden is rewriting Iron Age history",
      "summary": "A Swedish plano-convex ingot once thought to be from the Bronze Age was revealed through chemical and isotopic testing to belong to the Iron Age. Its composition closely matches Iron Age finds from Poland, leading researchers to uncover new evidence of long-distance connections across the Baltic. The study highlights how collaboration and scientific analysis can transform isolated artifacts into clues about ancient trade and networking.",
      "content": "A complete plano-convex ingot has been uncovered in Sweden for the first time. When researchers at the University of Gothenburg analyzed the object using isotopic and chemical methods, the results were surprising. \"Due, in particular, to its shape and size, it seemed to us a Bronze Age artifact, but the ingot turned out to be made of a copper-zinc-tin-lead alloy, typical of the Iron Age and later periods,\" says Serena Sabatini.\n\nPlano-convex ingots are most often made of copper, although some are formed from bronze or other copper-based alloys. They are frequently found in regions around the Mediterranean, as well as across continental Europe and along the Atlantic seaboard. Historically, these rounded ingots served as a practical way to transport metal during both the Bronze Age and the Iron Age.\n\nReevaluating the Särdal Find\n\nAt first, archaeologists from the University of Gothenburg assumed the Särdal ingot belonged to the Bronze Age. Because it was recovered on its own and lacked any material that could help assign a date, the team turned to scientific testing to understand what it was made of and to estimate when it might have been produced.\n\nTheir analyses overturned the initial assumption. The composition matched a copper-zinc-tin-lead alloy characteristic of the Iron Age and later periods.\n\nCollaboration Reveals Wider Connections\n\n\"Thanks to the collaborative climate of the archaeometallurgy research world- we teamed up with a group of Polish scholars, who were working with some Iron Age finds which have the almost exact composition of our ingot,\" says Serena Sabatini.\n\nAccording to the researchers, this case demonstrates that even isolated artifacts, which are often challenging to interpret, can gain meaningful historical context through careful study. Bringing together archaeological approaches with scientific analyses can turn a single, enigmatic object into evidence that contributes to a broader understanding of the past.\n\n\"Networking and international collaboration are also important to unveil patterns and data that would remain unknown when one look exclusively at the local context. This work clearly shows the importance of teamwork and data sharing. Without the successful collaboration with our Polish colleagues, we would have never achieved such remarkable results!\" says Serena Sabatini.\n\nApplying Established Archaeometallurgical Techniques\n\nThe research team used well-established techniques in archaeometallurgy (which is the branch of archaeology specialized in the study of ancient metals), including lead isotope and trace element analyses of metal artifacts. These analytical methods have been employed since the 1980s to study both the composition and the likely geological sources of metal (in the sense that they enable to point out the minerary region from which the metal was extracted).\n\n\"What is new in this study- is that we went a step further, and by combining the obtained data with known historical and archaeological information, we managed to propose a historical context, for both the unique Särdal plano-convex ingot and the rod ingots from the Iława Lakeland area in northeastern Poland. Given the astonishing similarity of the metal composition in all those artifacts we also manage to strengthen earlier hypotheses about contacts and networking in the Baltic area during the Nordic pre-Roman Iron Age,\" says Serena Sabatini.\n\nThe study is published in Journal of Archaeological Science.",

      "summary": "Monk parakeets ease into new friendships, slowly approaching strangers to avoid aggressive encounters. Researchers watched how birds shared space, groomed each other, and escalated to deeper social bonds over time. The results show a clear pattern of cautious exploration echoing similar studies in other animals. Even for birds, making a friend can be a delicate dance.",
      "content": "Forming new social connections is not always easy, even for animals known for their intelligence and communication skills. Researchers at the University of Cincinnati discovered that monk parakeets meeting unfamiliar birds tend to \"test the waters\" before deciding whether a potential partner is safe to approach. Instead of rushing in, the birds move gradually toward newcomers, taking time to observe and adjust before engaging in more daring interactions that could carry a higher risk of injury.\n\nThe findings appear in the journal Biology Letters.\n\nWhy Social Bonds Matter for Parrots\n\n\"There can be a lot of benefits to being social, but these friendships have to start somewhere,\" said Claire O'Connell, the study's lead author and a doctoral student in UC's College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nO'Connell worked with UC Associate Professor Elizabeth Hobson, former UC postdoctoral researcher Annemarie van der Marel, and Princeton University Associate Professor Gerald Carter. She explained that many parrot species develop strong, lasting relationships with one or two partners. These close companions often spend much of their time together, groom each other or even form reproductive partnerships. According to O'Connell, strong bonds like these are often linked to reduced stress and improved reproductive success.\n\nThe Risks of Making First Contact\n\nDespite the advantages of close relationships, approaching a stranger can be dangerous. O'Connell noted that birds uninterested in a newcomer's attention may respond aggressively, creating a real possibility of injury.\n\nTo better understand how these initial interactions unfold, researchers placed groups of wild-caught monk parakeets together in a spacious flight pen. Some individuals had never encountered each other before. The team recorded when new connections formed by tracking how close the birds allowed each other to come and identifying which pairs engaged in grooming or other friendly behaviors over time.\n\nTracking Relationship Development\n\nMore than 179 relationships were analyzed with computational tools and statistical models. The goal was to determine whether the progression of new social ties matched expectations from earlier work on the idea of testing the waters.\n\n\"Capturing the first moments between strangers can be challenging, so we were really excited that our experiments gave us the chance to observe that process up close,\" O'Connell said.\n\nThe data revealed that unfamiliar birds were far more cautious when approaching each other than when interacting with birds they already knew. Over time, however, many of the stranger pairs began sharing space more comfortably and eventually perched together, touched beaks or groomed each other. A few pairs progressed even further, sharing food or mating.\n\nA Pattern Seen in Other Social Species\n\nThe results mirrored a 2020 study of vampire bats showing that newcomers also test the waters, slowly progressing from grooming relationships to more substantial food-sharing partnerships with trusted companions.\n\n\"What's really fascinating about testing the waters is how intuitive it feels,\" O'Connell said.\n\nShe added that she could relate personally. \"I started observing the parakeets shortly before I moved to Cincinnati to start graduate school,\" she said. \"I was excited but also a little nervous about making new friends. At the same time, I was literally watching the parakeets make new friends themselves, although some did better than others. I started realizing there may be something I could learn from the parakeets.\"",
