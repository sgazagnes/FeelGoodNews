      "content": "A career makeover can allow scientists to explore their passions.Credit: Getty\n\nNick Sheron starts most days by strolling across his six-hectare farm with his two golden retrievers, Daphne and Phoebe, surveying the sheep that graze the land between autumn and early spring. From time to time, he yanks trapped ones from gaps in his fences. “They’re very good at getting their heads stuck in things,” he laughs.\n\nSheron, a liver physician, left a full-time academic role at the University of Southampton, UK, in 2019 when he and his wife Lisa bought a sixteenth-century longhouse in Devon’s Otter Valley — 150 kilometres west of his former workplace. They now grow apples and onions, brew their own beer, harvest honey from “fierce British black bees” (Apis mellifera mellifera), and rewild their meadows with yellow-rattle plants (Rhinanthus minor), which sap nutrients from grass and allow rare wild flowers to flourish. Sheron also has a chicken called Rowena, “who likes human company and follows me around all day”.\n\nCareers advice from scientists in industry\n\nIn between brewing beer and building a pizza oven from the farm’s clay, Sheron continues to work as an adviser on alcohol policy to the UK Department of Health and as a visiting professor at both King’s College London and the University of Plymouth, UK, studying the link between cheap alcohol and the continuing increase in liver-disease mortality.\n\n“We haven’t regretted the move at all,” Sheron says. On the contrary, “it’s absolutely fantastic” now his days are no longer spent staring at a screen, he says. As well as his visiting professorships, he expends his passion for science on growing, winnowing and selling in-demand yellow-rattle seed for others to buy and use to rewild their own green spaces.\n\nSheron is just one of many scientists who quit academia to reinvent themselves. Some opt for ‘science adjacent’ roles, while others embark on a completely different career path, often applying many of the skills that they acquired as working scientists. Many feel liberated from the stresses of academia’s ‘publish or perish’ culture, and say that they feel freed from the tedium of delivering the same lectures year after year.\n\nPeople start their own businesses or non-profit organizations; travel to do independent research or conservation work; and mentor others in their fields, hoping that they will have a greater impact on the world this way. Although taking the leap and leaving academia might be daunting, many say that they feel satisfied and have continued to learn as they pursue their passions in the wider world.\n\nNick Sheron now starts his mornings walking among the sheep on his farm in Devon, UK. Credit: Nick Sheron\n\nTurning science into business\n\nNot everyone leaves science of their own accord. Immunologist Luz Cumba Garcia was an adviser for sustainability to the US Department of State, supporting global-health efforts for HIV and AIDS through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR, which Cumba Garcia describes as “the most successful global health diplomacy programme in the world”, once supported 55 countries across Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Her role at PEPFAR was to help low- and middle-income countries develop sustainable health policies and strengthen health systems, thereby reducing dependency on the United States. Before that, she had led work on global health cooperation between the United States and Mexico, including coordination on transboundary health threats, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza.\n\nBut in January 2025, after the 2024 re-election of Donald Trump as US president, Cumba Garcia was placed on furlough from the state department. “It was a very cruel, very painful process,” she says, preceded by e-mails requesting that she and her colleagues justify their experience and accomplishments, to “prove we were worthy”. She was let go permanently in April 2025.\n\nBut she didn’t let the setback slow her down. “I enjoy giving workshops and training to scientists on how they can communicate with policymakers, and vice versa,” she says. “It was something I always did as a side hustle, so I said ‘what about doing this full time?’”\n\nHow to sail smoothly from academia to industry\n\nShe turned her passion into a business, founding her one-person company, SciPolicy Global Strategies, in July 2025. Her consulting work includes advising clients in the private sector and non-profit organizations on topics such as global health, biomedical research and the ethical use of artificial intelligence in scientific research. She also gives talks in both English and Spanish on how science can help policymaking, and leads interactive workshops and coaching on social-media management and personal branding for scientists.\n\nIt’s not all plain sailing, Cumba Garcia notes. “Some days are better than others,” she admits. “A good and productive day is one filled with networking, meetings or securing new consulting contracts or speaking engagements, work I truly enjoy,” she says. “A not-so-good day is when things take longer to materialize, such as delays in contracts or challenges in finding the right opportunities.”\n\n“At the same time, I think that this a great time to reinvent yourself, not under the ideal circumstances because the funding is lacking. But it’s also the time to be bold, to be brave, to embrace your passions.”\n\nPassion drove Erika Jefferson to found Black Women in Science and Engineering (BWISE) when she was laid off in 2015 from her job as a supply-chain optimization manager with Praxair, an industrial gas company, after a fall in oil prices. BWISE provides career-development and mentoring support to under-represented women in middle management and senior leadership roles, as well as early-career scientists, who have science, mathematics or engineering degrees. A chemical engineer by training, Jefferson had spent much of her career working for oil companies, including Chevron and Amoco.\n\n“I had already had the inklings of BWISE, so it was actually a blessing to leave and to really think ‘what could this be?’,” she says, recalling her moment of inspiration. “I went to a conference in 2015, and I was sitting in a row of other Black women. Everybody was an engineer. I started asking them, ‘How do you like your job?’ The answers ranged from, ‘I hate my job,’ to ‘I hate my job even more,’ to ‘I hate my job most of anyone in here.’”\n\nLuz Cumba Garcia delivers a talk at a conference in Guatemala.Credit: Luz M. Cumba Garcia\n\nThe women spoke of long hours dealing with breakdowns at chemical plants, but also of pervasive racism, “with maybe some sexism thrown in”, says Jefferson. “I thought, ‘Maybe we should get together and share insights.’” She started organizing networking events and coffee socials in her home city of Houston, Texas. “But I soon realized that some people are really struggling and that they need more than just a pat on the back. They need coaching, counselling and mentoring.”\n\n“In the beginning, I created something that didn’t exist for Black women,” says Jefferson, who is BWISE’s president.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, BWISE had expanded into multiple chapters in a number of US cities. It now has members around the world. “We’ve had career fairs, we’ve done informational sessions, we’ve had networking in-person events, we’ve had brunches, dinners, breakfasts — you name it, we’ve had it all over the country. So many folks have met each other and connected through BWISE,” she says.\n\nWhen scientists get laid off, “you want to pivot into something meaningful with the next phase of your life”, Jefferson advises. “I always ask people for one word to describe me, and they always say, ‘a connector’. I love connecting people, and my biggest pride is that the work that I started to help women has also now helped the coming generation of scientists.”\n\nLove for her career motivated Cláudia Santos to continue her fieldwork even when funding wasn’t forthcoming. In 2023, after completing her PhD at the University of Lisbon on the impact of climate change on human migration in Guinea-Bissau, she applied for a three-year contract with the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology. After waiting a year for a response, her application was rejected. The foundation merged with another to create the Agency for Research and Innovation (AI²) on 1 January.\n\nSelf-funded science\n\nSantos decided to pursue her own self-funded research in Guinea-Bissau on how people stay in their communities in the face of climate change, motivated by networks and solidarity, or because of spiritual attachment to their homes. “I wanted to continue to publish and write, because I really struggled to detach myself from Guinea-Bissau,” she says. While doing fieldwork with these communities, she made friends and learnt “very important communal values, the sense of caring when you have so little; it eventually puts everything in your life into perspective”.\n\nIn 2025, Santos co-founded Upstand, a social-enterprise company that is devoted to disaster-risk reduction, with climate change specialist Andreia Sousa. The two met through the University of Lisbon’s PhD programme in climate change and sustainable development policies. Upstand, Santos explains, “is a social-impact agency specializing in participatory research, facilitation and community-led design” supporting inclusive initiatives “across climate-change adaptation, human mobility, ocean biodiversity and disaster risk”.",

The European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maroš Šefčovič, who was involved in the finalization of the negotiations on this agreement, reiterated in a message to the media that the largest free trade zone in the world is being created, the TASR correspondent reports.\n\nThe signing of the trade agreement between the EU and Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay is widely covered in the European media, because the agreement has its supporters as well as loud critics. Maroš Šefčovič already on Friday (January 9) welcomed on the social network X the vote of the ambassadors to the EU, which confirmed that more than enough EU member states were found to approve the final signing of the agreement.\n\n“It is a strategic step for a strategic agreement connecting 700 million consumers,” is how Šefčovič described the vote of the member states.\n\nAccording to him, the EU-Mercosur partnership agreement is a “breakthrough success”, because it is an important moment not only for the EU’s trade policy, but also for the broader economic future of Europe.\n\n“The agreement will create the largest free trade zone in the world, which will connect more than 700 million consumers on two continents. From the automotive industry through machinery to wine, chocolate and olive oil,” said the Slovak European Commissioner.\n\nProducts from the EU will gain privileged access to an attractive market that has long demanded high tariffs, sometimes up to 55%.\n\nHe also recalled that products from the EU will gain privileged access to an attractive market that has long demanded high tariffs, sometimes up to 55%. At the same time, this agreement will ensure access to critical minerals, which are increasingly important today.\n\n“However, this agreement means much more than just trade figures. It is a strategic tool that will shape Europe’s role in the global economy for decades to come, strengthen our partnership with Latin America and protect the EU’s credibility as a reliable trading partner,” he explained.\n\nHe emphasized that his priority as European Commissioner for Trade remains that EU companies can benefit from this agreement as quickly as possible. He specified that, according to the EC’s expectations, exports of agricultural and food products from the EU to the Mercosur region will increase by 50%. At the same time, 344 iconic foods and beverages from the EU with protected designation will be protected, for example genuine champagne, Parmesan Reggiano or Irish whiskey.\n\n“Overall, this agreement strengthens the extensive network of free trade agreements of the European Union, the largest in the world, which remains a key strategic asset for maintaining our global economic advantage,” Šefčovič described the situation. He added that the EU continues to negotiate trade agreements in other key regions of the world as well. (January 12)",

      "content": "The Seven Rules of Trust: Why It Is Today’s Most Essential Superpower Jimmy Wales Bloomsbury (2025)\n\nJimmy Wales, an Internet entrepreneur from Huntsville, Alabama, now based in London, is best known for creating Wikipedia, which launched in January 2001. The online encyclopedia now holds more than seven million articles and has become a standard guide for anyone seeking information.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization in San Francisco, California, runs the project with about 700 employees, but Wikipedia still relies entirely on unpaid volunteers to write and edit its articles: hundreds of thousands of people contribute to the site each month, under a set of community-developed rules to deal with disagreements, cut down self-promotion and generate consensus.\n\nWales’ book, The Seven Rules of Trust, released in October, tells the tale of Wikipedia’s origins and how the project highlights lessons in earning and maintaining trust. Wales spoke to Nature about the importance of scientific transparency and the rise of artificial intelligence.\n\nAnyone can contribute to Wikipedia. Does the site lack respect for expertise?\n\nEverything about Wikipedia is a worship of expertise. We have rules about citing quality sources: newspapers, magazines, academic journals, peer-reviewed literature and books from reputable publishers. That’s very different from letting anyone offer a random opinion.\n\nIt is true that you don’t have to be an expert to write a Wikipedia article. But, for lots of topics, having amateur passion is a great way to get started. It’s like journalism: journalists have to write about topics that they aren’t experts in, but hopefully they consult and quote the experts. Then, the journalist can make sense of it.\n\nYour seven rules of trust are: be personal; collaborate; have a mission; give trust to get trust; stay civil; don’t take sides; and be transparent. Which one is most relevant to scientists?\n\n‘Be transparent’ is very important. That’s not an admonishment that science needs to become more transparent — it’s an observation that science is very transparent. There are obviously areas in which this could be improved, but I think that the statement is generally true.\n\nThere was a study of the ‘retraction penalty’, which found that running a correction for a scientific article is better for an author’s citation counts than is trying to bluff their way through it (S. F. Lu et al. Sci. Rep. 3, 3146; 2013). I thought that was super interesting research. The conclusion makes sense, but it’s nice to see science validate it.\n\nWikipedia prides itself on presenting balanced points of view. Is that hard?\n\nThat will always be a struggle. We think a lot about ‘wikivoice’: when do we say something in the voice of Wikipedia? Declaring ‘this is the fact’ is high risk.\n\nWe look for consensus not just in the sources, but also in the community of Wikipedians. If you have Wikipedians in good standing talking and editing in good faith, and no one is willing to stand up and say, ‘actually, I think that the evidence is still mixed’, then you can go ahead and use wikivoice.\n\nIt’s really important that we be as intellectually diverse as possible. If you ask an English speaker who invented the aeroplane, they will say the Wright brothers — like that’s a simple fact that we all learnt when we were six years old. But if you ask a French person, they might say something different: a Brazilian inventor [Alberto Santos-Dumont] who was living in France. We try to consider all sides of an issue. If we are not even aware of all sides of the issue, it becomes that much harder.\n\nHow do you try to increase the diversity of Wikipedia writers and editors?\n\nWe run ‘edit-athons’. Those have been successful in adding women in science as Wikipedians. But it’s hard. We have to be thoughtful about the environment of the site: is it open? Is it welcoming?\n\nI don’t have any statistics; I’m afraid the demographics haven’t changed nearly enough. We talk about it a lot. I want more people from different backgrounds to edit Wikipedia — so, anyone reading this, please come and help us.\n\nYou don’t mention ‘accountability’ as a pillar of trust in your book.\n\nThe concept is there. Our writers can use pseudonyms; many do. But Wikipedia runs on an accountability culture, rather than a gatekeeping culture. All edits that you make are tied to your account, and people can see your track record and your history. If you are not doing a good job, people will call you out. Accountability is incredibly important.\n\nDo all editors act in good faith?\n\nWe do see bad-faith actors who will solicit business by saying ‘I’m a Wikipedia administrator’ (they aren’t), claiming to be able to help write one-sided articles. I think it’s a bigger problem for their victims than it is for Wikipedia, because Wikipedia will require sources, and if the sources aren’t there, then the edits won’t stick.\n\nDo you see more problems now that artificial intelligence bots can write material?\n\nThis is something we need to be vigilant about, but it hasn’t yet been a major problem. Sheer volume isn’t really how Wikipedia works. If you start making ten edits a minute, you are blocked immediately. That’s obviously a bot doing something nefarious.\n\nIn fact, we don’t ban the use of AI. We do say, be very careful with it, and you’re responsible for what you put in Wikipedia.\n\nA lot of people write articles in a language that isn’t their first, so they use AI to help them with grammar. That sounds great to me — wonderful, more participation.\n\nDo you see generative AI as a threat to trust?\n\nThe hallucination problem — when large language models produce responses containing nonsensical or fabricated information — is still very bad. And the more obscure the topic, the worse the hallucinations become.\n\nThe sentences produced by chatbots sound very plausible, so I do think that’s a problem for trust. I am hoping that people’s reaction to this will be a renewed interest in journalism, old-school fact-checking and human oversight. If people think that the major news services are just ‘part of a conspiracy’, then we’re lost.\n\nCan AI be useful for trust?\n\nWikipedia is very transparent, but in some ways it’s so transparent that it’s opaque. If you want to know why a certain article is written a certain way, go to its talk page, and you can read all about it. But, sometimes, that’s 100 pages of debate. Who has time to read 100 pages?",
