      "summary": "As global energy demand surges—driven by AI-hungry data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrified transportation—researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have unveiled a breakthrough that could help squeeze far more power from existing electricity supplies. Their new silicon-carbide-based power module, called ULIS, packs dramatically more power into a smaller, lighter, and cheaper design while wasting far less energy in the process.",
      "content": "Global demand for electricity is rising fast. Energy-hungry data centers that support artificial intelligence, along with expanding manufacturing, are putting unprecedented pressure on power systems worldwide. Meeting that demand will require more than simply generating additional electricity.\n\nOne promising solution is to use existing energy supplies far more efficiently and at lower cost.\n\nA New Approach to Power Efficiency\n\nResearchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have developed a new silicon carbide based power module designed to dramatically improve how electricity is converted and delivered. A power module is the housing that contains power electronics, which regulate the flow of electricity between systems. This new design delivers record-breaking efficiency, higher power density, and a manufacturing process that keeps costs low.\n\nThe technology is known as NREL's Ultra-Low Inductance Smart power module, or ULIS. By using silicon carbide semiconductors, ULIS can achieve five times the energy density of earlier designs while taking up less space. That combination allows manufacturers to build equipment that is smaller, lighter, and more energy efficient. The 1200-volt, 400-amp module is well suited for data centers, electrical grids, microreactors, and heavy-duty platforms such as next-generation aircraft and military vehicles.\n\nWhy Ultra-Low Inductance Matters\n\nA key advantage of ULIS is its exceptionally low parasitic inductance, which refers to resistance that slows changes in electrical current and limits efficient power conversion. ULIS reduces this resistance by seven to nine times compared with today's most advanced silicon carbide power modules.\n\nBecause the system can switch electrical current extremely quickly and efficiently, it converts more of the available electricity into usable power. That capability allows ULIS to extract significantly more value from the same energy supply, making it a strong candidate for addressing growing global energy needs.\n\n\"We consider ULIS to be a true breakthrough,\" said Faisal Khan, NREL's chief power electronics researcher and the principal investigator for the project. \"It's a future-proofed, ultrafast power module that will make the next generation of power converters more affordable, efficient, and compact.\"\n\nBuilt for Reliability in Extreme Conditions\n\nULIS is designed not only for efficiency, but also for reliability in demanding environments. According to Khan, the lightweight yet powerful module can monitor its own condition and anticipate component failures before they happen.\n\nThis feature is especially critical for high-risk applications such as aviation and military operations. For aircraft operating at 30,000 feet or vehicles navigating combat zones, early failure detection can be the difference between mission success and catastrophic loss.\n\n\"ULIS was a truly organic effort, built entirely in-house here at NREL,\" Khan said. \"We are very excited to demonstrate its strengths in real-world settings.\"\n\nA Radical Redesign for Lower Cost Manufacturing\n\nMany of ULIS' performance gains come from a completely new physical design.\n\nTraditional power modules stack semiconductor devices inside box-like packages. ULIS instead arranges its circuitry in a flat, octagonal layout. This disk-shaped structure fits more components into a smaller footprint, reducing both size and weight. At the same time, its innovative current routing minimizes magnetic interference, which helps deliver cleaner electrical output and higher overall efficiency.\n\n\"Our biggest concern was that the device switches off and on very quickly, and we needed a layout that wouldn't create a chokepoint within the design,\" said Shuofeng Zhao, an NREL power electronics researcher who designed ULIS' flux cancellation architecture.\n\nEarly concepts explored complex three-dimensional shapes, including designs resembling flowers or hollow cylinders. However, these ideas proved too expensive or difficult to manufacture. The breakthrough came when the team simplified the concept into a nearly two-dimensional structure. Sarwar Islam, another NREL power electronics researcher, proposed the flattened design that balanced performance, cost, and manufacturability.\n\n\"We squished it flat, like a pancake,\" Zhao said, \"and suddenly we had a low-cost, high-performing design that was much easier to fabricate.\"\n\nJoshua Major, also part of the NREL power electronics team, developed new fabrication methods that allowed the intricate structure to be produced using only in-house tools and facilities. The result was a design that combined the electrical advantages of three-dimensional systems with the practicality of flat manufacturing.\n\nFlexible Materials and Wireless Control\n\nULIS also departs from conventional materials. Traditional power modules bond copper directly to rigid ceramic bases to conduct electricity and manage heat. While effective, this approach limits flexibility.\n\nInstead, ULIS bonds copper to a flexible polymer called Temprion. This change produces a thinner, lighter, and more adaptable structure. The material bonds to copper using only heat and pressure, and its components can be machined with widely available equipment. As a result, manufacturing costs fall into the hundreds of dollars rather than the thousands.\n\nAnother major advance allows ULIS to operate wirelessly. The module can be controlled and monitored without physical cables, functioning as a self-contained unit. This modular, Lego-like design allows it to be integrated into a wide range of systems, from data center servers to advanced aircraft and military vehicles. A patent for the low-latency wireless communication protocol, led by Sarwar Islam, is currently pending.\n\nDesigned for Future Technologies\n\nWhile ULIS currently relies on advanced silicon carbide semiconductors, the design was intentionally built to evolve. The module can be adapted for future semiconductor materials, including gallium nitride and gallium oxide, which has not yet reached commercial use.\n\nTogether, these innovations support a central goal. As societies become increasingly dependent on reliable electricity, ULIS is designed to deliver efficiency without sacrificing dependability.\n\nWhere ULIS Could Make the Biggest Difference\n\nULIS is expected to have broad impact across multiple sectors.\n\nIn the U.S. power grid, electricity must be converted into usable forms before it reaches consumers. This process often depends on large, low-frequency equipment that wastes energy. ULIS' fast switching improves efficiency while its ability to tolerate high temperatures may reduce long-term maintenance costs.\n\nIn aviation, the module's ability to move electricity quickly and conserve energy enables lighter and more powerful converters. This could help make electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft more practical and commercially viable.\n\nULIS could also play a role in future fusion energy systems. Although commercial fusion remains under development, these systems will require compact and reliable pulsed power components. ULIS' ultralow inductance and durable design make it well suited for that challenge.\n\nAs industries pursue more reliable electricity, advanced artificial intelligence, and next-generation vehicles, ULIS is now available for licensing.",

      "content": "Hidden cameras reveal what hedgehogs really get up to after dark\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Helen Briggs , Environment correspondent and Gwyndaf Hughes , Science videographer Share Save\n\nWatch: hedgehogs have been busy in our gardens at night\n\nBritish gardens matter more than ever for hedgehogs, according to a study of the secret night life of the spiny mammals. Scientists gave householders wildlife cameras to spy on hedgehogs in more than 400 gardens in Chester in one of the largest studies of its kind. The animals turned up in more than half of gardens studied, with food a powerful attraction. As numbers fall, scientists say these night-time visits could hold vital clues to the nocturnal mammal's survival.\n\nA rescued hedgehog recovers in a field hospital in South Wales\n\nHedgehogs are listed as vulnerable to extinction in the UK, with populations falling, particularly in rural areas, due to habitat loss, intensive farming and death on roads. Lead researcher, Kelly Hitchcock, of Nottingham Trent University and Chester Zoo, said: \"The pattern that we've seen is that hedgehog populations in rural areas have declined – gardens seem like a really important habitat – so it's really important that people are aware of that.\" The researchers analysed thousands of images from 415 gardens, alongside each garden's specific characteristics, to examine how often hedgehogs were detected and which features most influenced them stopping by. Leaving food out was the biggest factor, but the experts say providing wildlife friendly features is essential too as hedgehogs struggle to find space to hibernate and breed. These include patches of wildflowers, native plants, leaf litter and log piles, and holes in fences so hedgehogs can roam over large areas. If you are providing wildlife food, be mindful of what that food is and whether it's suitable for hedgehogs, said Hitchcock. \"It's not that we want to say everybody feed hedgehogs because we don't know the long-term impacts,\" she added.\n\nChester Zoo/Nottingham Trent University Numbers of hedgehogs have fallen by up to 30% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas since 2000\n\nThe study comes as increasing numbers of hedgehogs need help from rescue charities as they lose their natural habitats. Any hedgehog out in the day is a cause for concern – as are hedgehogs seen limping or injured, said Sarah Liney of the charity, Hedgehog Helpline, in South Wales. \"If we can release a healthy hedgehog back into the wild, to be the hedgehog it is supposed to be, and it can produce or help to produce more litters then at least that is going to help with the hedgehog population to continue for years to come within our country,\" she said.\n\nChester Zoo/Nottingham Trent University Hedgehogs roam side by side with foxes in our gardens",

      "title": "Scientists trace fertilizer microplastics from fields to beaches",
      "summary": "Plastic-coated fertilizers used on farms are emerging as a major but hidden source of ocean microplastics. A new study found that only a tiny fraction reaches beaches through rivers, while direct drainage from fields to the sea sends far more plastic back onto shore. Once there, waves and tides briefly trap the particles on beaches before many vanish again. This helps explain why so much plastic pollution seems to disappear after reaching the ocean.",
      "content": "Researchers at Tokyo Metropolitan University set out to understand how polymer-coated fertilizer (PCF) used on farmland eventually reaches beaches and ocean waters. By examining PCF debris collected from shorelines across Japan, they found that very little fertilizer plastic returns to land through rivers. Only about 0.2% of the PCFs applied in nearby areas were detected on beaches near river mouths. However, the picture changes dramatically when farmland is connected to the ocean by canals. In those cases, as much as 28% of the fertilizer plastic was found washing back onto shore. These results point to beaches as a potentially important but overlooked \"sink\" in the global movement of plastic pollution.\n\nPlastic pollution in the ocean threatens marine life, ecosystems, and human health. Scientists estimate that roughly 90% of the plastic that has entered the ocean is no longer visible at the surface. Much of it is believed to have settled on the seafloor or become trapped in various environmental \"sinks.\" To reduce the growing problem of plastic waste, researchers are trying to untangle how plastic travels from where it is used on land to where it ultimately ends up in the ocean.\n\nFertilizer Coatings as a Major Source of Microplastics\n\nPolymer-coated fertilizer (PCF) has emerged as a significant contributor to microplastic pollution. These fertilizers are wrapped in a thin plastic layer that slows the release of nutrients, allowing them to last longer in the soil. PCFs are commonly used for rice farming in Japan and China and are also applied to crops such as wheat and corn in the U.S., U.K., and Western Europe. Previous studies have shown that 50-90% of the plastic debris found on Japanese beaches originates from these fertilizer coatings. Despite this, scientists have had limited understanding of how PCFs move from farmland into waterways and how that journey influences where the plastic ultimately accumulates.\n\nHow Water Pathways Shape Plastic Pollution\n\nThe research team, led by Professor Masayuki Kawahigashi and Dr. Dolgormaa Munkhbat, conducted extensive surveys of fertilizer plastic deposits in different coastal settings. They examined 147 survey plots across 17 beaches, focusing on locations near river mouths and areas where agricultural land drains directly into the sea.\n\nTheir findings revealed sharp contrasts. Near river mouths, the amount of PCF found on beaches accounted for less than 0.2% of the fertilizer used in surrounding fields. About 77% of the material remained on farmland, while the remaining 22.8% was carried out to sea. In areas with direct drainage from fields to the ocean, however, 28% of the fertilizer plastic ended up back on nearby beaches. The researchers concluded that waves and tidal forces play a key role in pushing these plastics ashore, turning beaches into temporary storage sites for microplastics. Since most PCFs that leave fields enter rivers, the majority of these plastic capsules ultimately go \"missing.\"\n\nWhy Some Plastics Stop Washing Back\n\nThe researchers also observed physical changes in many of the fertilizer microplastics collected from beaches. Many particles showed noticeable reddening and browning. Using Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), the team detected added layers of iron and aluminum oxide on the plastic surfaces. These materials may increase the weight of the capsules, making them less likely to be carried back to shore by waves.\n\nAlthough many questions remain about how plastic pollution moves through the environment, this study provides an important step forward. By mapping how fertilizer plastics travel from land to sea, the researchers have helped shed light on how PCFs contribute to the global problem of missing plastics.",

      "summary": "The Parliament will renovate the Paul-Henri Spaak building in Brussels to bring it up to latest environmental, technical and security standards. Source : © European Union, 2026 - EP",
      "content": "The European Parliament will renovate the Paul-Henri Spaak (SPAAK) building to meet the latest energy efficiency and environmental standards as approved by Parliament's Bureau and Committee on Budgets. The renovation is necessary to address a number of shortcomings, including on security and fire safety, and to modernise ageing building systems that no longer meet today’s standards. The building hosts one of Parliament’s plenary chambers (hemicycle), meeting rooms, offices as well as the press and visitors’ area. The €455 million (value April 2023) investment will be spread over the years 2024-2031.\n\nIn mid-February 2026, Parliament will submit the renovation permit to the local authorities (Urban). The objective is for the actual renovation works to start at the beginning of 2027 and to inaugurate the renovated hemicycle in 2030, the year Belgium as a host Member State celebrates the 200th anniversary of its independence.\n\nEnvironmental performance\n\nA major part of the works will be directed at significantly improving the environmental performance of the SPAAK building, including its energy efficiency in line with Parliament's commitment to these issues and with obligations under EU and national legislation. The renovation will enable important savings on energy and maintenance costs. It will also upgrade the security and durability of the building.\n\nThe renovation of the building aims to achieve a nearly zero-energy and zero-emission status, implement a proactive rainwater management system, and significantly reduce waste and carbon footprint through circularity principles and life-cycle assessment of materials. The protection and enhancement of biodiversity on the site and in its surroundings will also form an integral part of this strategy. The building will be independently certified under the DGNB global sustainability standard with an objective to achieve the gold certification level.\n\nAs a result of these measures, the building’s CO₂ emissions are expected to decrease significantly, supporting the goal of making it one of the greenest parliamentary buildings in the world.\n\nImproving functionality and openness\n\nThe renovated building will retain the current building’s functions while optimising them. It will include new dedicated spaces to host interinstitutional negotiations (trilogues).\n\nThe European Parliament is open to the citizens it represents, and one aim of the renovation is to convey these values, and engage with citizens.\n\nThe renovation will therefore ensure a better visual integration of the building into its surroundings while maintaining its existing shape and preserving most of its structure. A new multilayered facade will bring in more light, improving the building’s spatial overview, energy performance, internal connectivity and openness to the outside world.\n\nParliament’s activities in Brussels will be guaranteed throughout the renovation.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe project is currently in the preliminary design phase including the preparation of the permit request. In parallel, Parliament is preparing the tender for the renovation works. Pending permit approval, the objective is for the actual works to start in the beginning of 2027 and to inaugurate the renovated hemicycle in 2030 - the year Belgium as a host Member State celebrates the 200th anniversary of its independence.\n\nMore information on the building in the background note.",
