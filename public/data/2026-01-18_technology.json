      "title": "Engineers just created a “phonon laser” that could shrink your next smartphone",
      "summary": "Engineers have created a device that generates incredibly tiny, earthquake-like vibrations on a microchip—and it could transform future electronics. Using a new kind of “phonon laser,” the team can produce ultra-fast surface waves that already play a hidden role in smartphones, GPS systems, and wireless tech. Unlike today’s bulky setups, this single-chip device could deliver far higher performance using less power, opening the door to smaller, faster, and more efficient phones and wireless devices.",
      "content": "Engineers have taken a major step toward producing the smallest earthquakes ever created, shrinking seismic-style vibrations down to the scale of a microchip.\n\nThe breakthrough centers on a device called a surface acoustic wave phonon laser. The technology could eventually enable more advanced chips for smartphones and other wireless electronics, helping make them smaller, faster, and more energy efficient.\n\nThe research was led by Matt Eichenfield, an incoming faculty member at the University of Colorado Boulder, along with scientists from the University of Arizona and Sandia National Laboratories. Their findings were published Jan. 14 in the journal Nature.\n\nWhat Are Surface Acoustic Waves?\n\nThe new device relies on surface acoustic waves, commonly known as SAWs. These waves behave somewhat like sound waves, but instead of traveling through the air or deep inside a material, they move only along its surface.\n\nLarge earthquakes naturally produce powerful surface acoustic waves that ripple across the Earth's crust, shaking buildings and causing damage. On a much smaller scale, SAWs are already essential to modern technology.\n\n\"SAWs devices are critical to the many of the world's most important technologies,\" said Eichenfield, senior author of the new study and Gustafson Endowed Chair in Quantum Engineering at CU Boulder. \"They're in all modern cell phones, key fobs, garage door openers, most GPS receivers, many radar systems and more.\"\n\nHow SAWs Already Power Smartphones\n\nInside a smartphone, SAWs function as highly precise filters. Radio signals arriving from a cell tower are first converted into tiny mechanical vibrations. This allows chips to separate useful signals from interference and background noise. The cleaned vibrations are then converted back into radio waves.\n\nIn this study, Eichenfield and his colleagues introduced a new way to generate these surface waves using what they call a phonon laser. Unlike a typical laser pointer that emits light, this device produces controlled vibrations.\n\n\"Think of it almost like the waves from an earthquake, only on the surface of a small chip,\" said Alexander Wendt, a graduate student at the University of Arizona and lead author of the study.\n\nMost existing SAW systems require two separate chips and an external power source. The new design combines everything into a single chip and could operate using just a battery while reaching much higher frequencies.\n\nA Laser Built for Vibrations\n\nTo understand the new device, it helps to start with how conventional lasers work.\n\nMany everyday lasers are diode lasers, which create light by bouncing it between two tiny mirrors on a semiconductor chip. As the light reflects back and forth, it interacts with atoms energized by an electric current. Those atoms release additional light, strengthening the beam.\n\n\"Diode lasers are the cornerstone of most optical technologies because they can be operated with just a battery or simple voltage source, rather than needing more light to create the laser like a lot of previous kinds of lasers,\" Eichenfield said. \"We wanted to make an analog of that kind of laser but for SAWs.\"\n\nTo achieve this, the team built a bar-shaped device about half a millimeter long.\n\nA Stack of Specialized Materials\n\nThe device consists of several layered materials. At its base is silicon, the same material used in most computer chips. Above that sits a thin layer of lithium niobate, a piezoelectric material. When lithium niobate vibrates, it produces oscillating electric fields, and those electric fields can also trigger vibrations.\n\nThe final layer is an extremely thin sheet of indium gallium arsenide. This material has unusual electronic properties and can accelerate electrons to very high speeds even under weak electric fields.\n\nTogether, these layers allow vibrations traveling along the lithium niobate surface to interact directly with fast-moving electrons in the indium gallium arsenide.\n\nMaking Waves Build Like a Laser\n\nThe researchers describe the device as working similarly to a wave pool.\n\nWhen electric current flows through the indium gallium arsenide, surface waves form in the lithium niobate layer. These waves travel forward, strike a reflector, and then move backward, much like light reflecting between mirrors in a laser. Each forward pass strengthens the wave, while each backward pass weakens it.\n\n\"It loses almost 99% of its power when it's moving backward, so we designed it to get a substantial amount of gain moving forward to beat that,\" Wendt said.\n\nAfter repeated passes, the vibrations grow strong enough that a portion escapes from one side of the device, similar to how laser light eventually exits its cavity.\n\nFaster Waves, Smaller Devices\n\nUsing this approach, the team generated surface acoustic waves vibrating at about 1 gigahertz, meaning billions of oscillations per second. The researchers believe the same design could be pushed into tens or even hundreds of gigahertz.\n\nTraditional SAW devices typically max out at around 4 gigahertz, making the new system far faster.\n\nEichenfield said the advance could lead to wireless devices that are smaller, more powerful, and more energy efficient.\n\nIn today's smartphones, multiple chips repeatedly convert radio waves into SAWs and back again whenever users send messages, make calls, or browse the internet. The researchers aim to simplify that process by creating a single chip that handles all of the signal processing using surface acoustic waves.\n\n\"This phonon laser was the last domino standing that we needed to knock down,\" Eichenfield said. \"Now we can literally make every component that you need for a radio on one chip using the same kind of technology.\"",

      "content": "Students are more likely to show risk-taking behaviour if their supervisors have a tendency for risky projects. Credit: Getty\n\nA researchers’ propensity for risky projects is passed down to their doctoral students — and stays with trainees after they leave the laboratory, according to an analysis1 of thousands of current and former PhD students and their mentors.\n\nScience involves taking risks, and some of the most impactful discoveries require taking big bets. However, scientists and policymakers have raised concerns that the current academic system’s emphasis on short-term outcomes encourages researchers to play it safe. Studies have shown, for example, that risky research is less likely to be funded2,3. Anders Broström, an economist studying science policy at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, and his colleagues decided to examine the role of doctoral education in shaping risk-related behaviour — an area that Broström says has been largely overlooked.\n\n“We often focus on thinking about how we can change the funding systems to make it more likely for people to take risks, but that’s not the only lever we have,” says Chiara Franzoni, an economist at the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy. This study is “refreshing” because “we’ve discussed policy interventions a lot, but we haven’t discussed training”, she adds.\n\nLeaps into the unknown\n\nBroström and his colleagues first looked at the effect of supervision on current students. They received responses to a survey designed to measure risk-taking from 1,223 PhD students enrolled in medical-science programmes at seven universities in Sweden. Participants were asked, for example, to report how likely they were to take part in a safe project — defined as one that would guarantee publication in a mid-ranking journal — compared with a risky project, which was less likely to succeed but more likely to end up in a high-ranking publication.\n\nThe researchers also examined the publication history of the students and their supervisors. To calculate the risk level involved in a particular study, they used a machine-learning algorithm that predicted the likelihood of ideas from other studies being successfully combined (determined by how often pairs of citations appeared together in other publications). Papers that merged pairs of references with a high chance of not being successfully combined were considered riskier than those that did not.\n\nThe team found that students’ risk-taking dispositions matched those of their supervisors. This link was stronger when students and their supervisors communicated frequently, and weaker when students were also mentored by scientists outside their lab.\n\nSupervisors’ influence also persisted post-graduation. When the team analysed bibliometric data from 2,400 former PhD students and their supervisors, it found that a supervisors’ influence on their students’ approach to risk persisted a decade after leaving the lab — even if the former trainees changed research topics.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Science often requires taking risks to make big discoveries. However, many researchers avoid risky projects because funding is harder to get for them. Until now, little was known about how doctoral supervisors influence their students’ willingness to take such risks.\n\n**What happened** – A team of researchers studied over a thousand medical PhD students in Sweden and analyzed their supervisors’ and students’ publication records. They found that students tend to take similar risks in their research as their supervisors do. This connection was stronger when students communicated more with their supervisors. The influence remained strong even ten years after students finished their PhDs, even if they changed their research topics.\n\n**Impact** – This study shows that the way supervisors encourage risk-taking shapes students’ long-term research choices. It suggests that training during doctoral education can be as important as funding policies for encouraging bold scientific ideas. Understanding this could help universities and policymakers support more innovative research.\n\n**What's next step** – Future efforts might focus on how doctoral training programs can encourage healthy risk-taking.
