      "summary": "WISPIT 2b, a gas giant forming around a young Sun-like star, has been directly imaged for the first time inside a spectacular multi-ringed disk. Still glowing and actively accreting gas, the planet offers a unique opportunity to study planetary birth and evolution.",
      "content": "An international team of astronomers, co-led by researchers at University of Galway, has made the unexpected discovery of a new planet.\n\nDetected at an early stage of formation around a young analog of our own Sun, the planet is estimated to be about 5 million years-old and most likely a gas giant of similar size to Jupiter.\n\nThe study, which was led by Leiden University, University of Galway and University of Arizona, has been published in the international journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nThe ground-breaking discovery was made using one of the world's most advanced observatories -- the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT) in the Atacama Desert in Chile.\n\nTo coincide with the research being published, the European Southern Observatory -- the world's foremost international astronomy organization -- has released a stunning image of the discovery as their picture of the week. View images here.\n\nThe new planet has been named WISPIT 2b.\n\nDr Christian Ginski, lecturer at the School of Natural Sciences, University of Galway and second author of the study, said: \"We used these really short snapshot observations of many young stars -- only a few minutes per object -- to determine if we could see a little dot of light next to them that is caused by a planet. However, in the case of this star, we instead detected a completely unexpected and exceptionally beautiful multi-ringed dust disk.\n\n\"When we saw this multi-ringed disk for the first time, we knew we had to try and see if we could detect a planet within it, so we quickly asked for follow-up observations.\"\n\nIt is only the second time a confirmed planet has been detected at this early evolutionary stage around a young version of our Sun. The first one was discovered in 2018, by a research team also involving Dr Ginski.\n\nWISPIT 2b is also the first unambiguous planet detection in a multi-ringed disk, making it the ideal laboratory to study planet-disk interaction and subsequent evolution.\n\nThe planet was captured in near infrared light - the type of view that someone would see when using night-vision goggles -- as it is still glowing and hot after its initial formation phase.\n\nThe team at Leiden University and University of Galway captured a spectacular clear image of the young proto-planet embedded in a disk gap. They also confirmed that the planet is orbiting its host star.\n\nThe planet was also detected in visible light by a team from the University of Arizona using a specially designed instrument. This detection at a specific wavelength or color of light indicates that the planet is still actively accreting gas as it is forming its atmosphere.\n\nWISPIT 2b was detected as part of a five-year observational research project during which the international team sought to establish whether wide orbit gas giant planets are more common around younger or older stars. This led to the unexpected discovery of the new planet.\n\nDust and gas rich disks around young stars are the birth cradles of planets. They can look quite spectacular with many different structures such as rings and spiral arms, which researchers believe are related to planets forming within them. The disk around WISPIT 2b has a radius of 380 astronomical units -- about 380 times the distance between Earth and the Sun.\n\nDr Ginski added:\"Capturing an image of these forming planets has proven extremely challenging and it gives us a real chance to understand why the many thousands of older exoplanet systems out there look so diverse and so different from our own solar system. I think many of our colleagues who study planet formation will take a close look at this system in the years to come.\"\n\nThe study was led by an early career PhD student, Richelle van Capelleveen from Leiden University and co-led by a graduate student team at University of Galway.\n\nThe research findings were co-authored by Dr Ginski and three Physics graduates students who are specializing in Astrophysics at University of Galway.\n\nA companion study by the University of Arizona was led by Professor Laird Close, where observations were triggered based on the information shared about the new disk by the University of Galway and Leiden University team.\n\nRichelle van Capelleveen said: \"Discovering this planet was an amazing experience -- we were incredibly lucky. WISPIT 2, a young version of our Sun, is located in a little-studied group of young stars, and we did not expect to find such a spectacular system. This system will likely be a benchmark for years to come.\"\n\nDr Ginski said: \"We were so fortunate to have these incredible young researchers on the case. This is the next generation of astrophysicists who I am sure will make more breakthrough discoveries in the years to come.\"\n\nChloe Lawlor, PhD student in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics at University of Galway, said: \"I feel incredibly fortunate to be involved in such an exciting and potentially career defining discovery. WISPIT 2b, with its position within its birth disk, is a beautiful example of a planet that can be used to explore current planet formation models. I am certain this will become a landmark paper, owing particularly to the work of Richelle van Capelleveen and her exceptional team.\"\n\nJake Byrne, MSc student in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics at University of Galway, said: \"The planet is a remarkable discovery. I could hardly believe it was a real detection when Dr Ginski first showed me the image. It's a big one -- that's sure to spark discussion within the research community and advance our understanding of planet formation. Contributing to something this impactful, and doing so alongside international collaborators, is exactly the kind of opportunity early-career researchers like Chloe, Dan and I dream of.\"\n\nDan McLachlan, MSc student in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics at University of Galway, said: \"In my experience so far working in astronomy, sometimes you can get so focused on a small task and you forget about the big picture, and when you zoom out and take in the magnitude of what you are working on it shocks you. This was one such project (an exoplanet direct detection!) and it was such a mind-blowing thing to be a part of. I feel so well treated by the University of Galway Physics department and especially my supervisor Dr Christian Ginski to have provided me with the opportunity to be part of such an exciting project.\"",

Elon Musk, the owner of SpaceX, has even said that Starship is key to his goal of colonising Mars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe firm is using a fail-fast, learn-fast strategy more common in Silicon Valley than the conservative world of space exploration. But despite an expectation of repeated failure, a recent run of bad luck still concerned many observers.\n\nTest flights 7, 8 and 9 all ended in disaster for Starship’s upper stage, which either exploded or broke up on reentry and didn’t reach Earth for a safe landing. Preparations for test flight 10 also encountered problems when an upper stage exploded while it was being loaded with propellant for a ground test.\n\nThe run of failures had led to some criticism and suggestions that SpaceX would be unable to get its rapid reuse concept up and running. But the 10th test flight on 26 August from SpaceX’s Starbase in Texas was largely a success, albeit one that came after two consecutive launch date cancellations.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThe upper stage reached space, deployed eight mock-up Starlink satellites and tested its ability to relight its engines in a vacuum. An unexpected explosion did cause damage near the engines, but nonetheless the ship completed its mission, reentered Earth’s atmosphere and slowed itself for a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean at a precise location, where a camera-equipped buoy gave SpaceX engineers crucial views of the craft’s behaviour.\n\nThe booster stage separated from Starship and also carried out a controlled splashdown, this time in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSpaceX didn’t respond to a request for comment, but said on its website that every “major objective was met” during the mission.\n\nPatrick Harkness at the University of Glasgow, UK, says the launch was “an incredible achievement which brings us closer to low-cost, high-cadence, bulk transport to space”.\n\nDespite the improvement in fortunes, doubts remain that Starship can be ready in time for NASA’s Artemis III crewed landing on the moon, currently scheduled for 2027. SpaceX also still aims to send a Starship – albeit uncrewed – to Mars in 2026.",

      "title": "Why auroras are so much brighter and more easily visible recently",

      "content": "The aurora borealis has been remarkably bright recently. Space weather physicist Tamitha Skov reveals what's going on and how worried we should be about a major solar storm\n\nUnexpectedly bright northern lights illuminated UK skies in 2024 John Hayward/SWNS\n\nIf you’re a fan of the aurora borealis, or northern lights, then you’re in luck. Last year was a bonanza, with auroras visible from all over the world – and twice they showed up brighter and farther south than in recent living memory. With the solar cycle now at its peak, even more stunning shows are on the cards, with the most extreme categories of geomagnetic storms likely to occur. To understand what’s been causing these otherworldly sheets of light in the sky, you need to look towards where they originate: in the fiery inferno of the sun.\n\nUnderstanding how the sun operates is crucial to explaining not just the aurora but all manner of phenomena happening in Earth’s atmosphere and in the solar system more widely. Space weather physicist Tamitha Skov has been helping the public better understand our sun’s mysterious workings for decades, through her aurora and space weather forecasts on TV and on her popular social media channels.\n\nSkov spoke to New Scientist about why we are seeing such extreme auroras, and how space weather is more than pretty lights on Earth. It is a genuine hazard for spacecraft and astronauts that venture out beyond our protective magnetosphere, as their electronic and biological systems are vulnerable to high-energy particles and radiation belched out by the sun, says Skov. Scientists need to monitor and plan around these potential dangers and are constantly finding better ways to forecast future space weather. “Every good sailor knows if you ignore the weather, you do it at your peril. You always check the weather, and it’s no different in space,” she says.\n\nAlex Wilkins: What drew you to the sun and space weather as an object of study?\n\nTamitha Skov: Obviously, a big ball of fire that continues to maintain its own integrity over billions of years is fascinating in its own right. But to be totally honest, my interest in our star is because we come from it. I’m a big fan of Carl Sagan, and one of the things he always said was: “We are all made of star stuff.” It’s interesting to ponder that from the perspective of what are the elements, and how are they formed.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nWhat ended up happening is that as I took a look at the sun from a physical perspective, I was rapidly diverted into space weather. I had no idea at the time that we had weather from our star, and that became an even more interesting focus to me, because of these transient events that would occur. I ended up getting lost in this amazing world of electric and magnetic fields that are completely invisible to us, but that guide everything in space and guide all of the dynamics that occur on the sun itself. It became this very hidden-in-plain-sight mystery.\n\nWe’ve been seeing many more auroras lately, in unusual places, largely due to a peak in solar activity. What’s happening with the sun?\n\nIt is the solar cycle. Our sun has many cycles, but the dominant one is something we call the Schwabe cycle. Every 11 years, our sun completes an entire cycle where it’s basically hibernating during solar minimum, and then it wakes up and becomes an angry bear.\n\nWhat is actually happening is that the magnetic field of our sun is flipping, and as it flips, it’s like a lava lamp. When the lava lamp is off, you’ve got two liquids that are together and quiescent – it’s very organised, the magnetic field lines aren’t crossed over and it’s therefore very quiet, and there’s not a lot of space weather.\n\nBut as soon as you turn that lava lamp on and you add heat, suddenly you get these bubbles rising, and pretty soon the lava lamp is just a bunch of islands of different material. That’s what our sun looks like, magnetically, during solar maximum. It is islands of plasma with separate magnetic fields that aren’t connected to each other, but when they do connect, they can release a lot of energy. As you can imagine, that’s extremely unstable. This is when our sun is the least organised magnetically, so there are a lot of eruptions that occur as the sun is trying to reorganise its magnetic field.\n\nTamitha Skov says the sun’s increased activity at the moment is actually a return to normal NG Images/Alamy\n\nWith the auroras visible much farther south than most people can remember, are we seeing something different from previous solar cycles?\n\nTo some degree, we are. It’s like everything just conspired together to create this very intriguing moment in time in our society. We had two solar cycles of very quiet activity, and just as our sun was sleeping through these last two solar cycles, technology has leapt forward from the 1990s. Now we have social media, and you can instantaneously tell your friends halfway around the world what’s going on. Prior to this, when we had really big storms, there was none of that. You also didn’t have incredibly sensitive cameras in everybody’s back pocket.\n\nJump to today, where we have solar cycle 25 and we’re getting G4- and G5-level storms [the most extreme categories], and we have cameras that can see auroras better than our eyes can. You take a picture with one of these things, even when the aurora is dim, and it stands out. It’s colourful. It gives people this false thought that the aurora never existed, that it was never around before. But in actuality, what we scientists are finding out is that the aurora is around a lot, we just never knew – it was just nearly always too dim to see.\n\nTo make it even more complicated, Earth’s magnetic field is changing, which means that the locations of auroras are changing. Particles can penetrate more deeply because our field is getting a little bit weaker as the churning in the planet’s core that generates it naturally slows down, so auroras can maybe penetrate a little bit farther south.\n\nIf we’re seeing this many auroras, does that mean the sun is going through a particularly active solar maximum?\n\nNow that we’re at the solar maximum in this cycle, which is numbered cycle 25, everybody is like, “Whoa, what’s the sun doing? This is so weird. It’s not supposed to do this. It never does this.” Well, that’s not true. The anomaly was actually cycle 24 and even cycle 23 before it. Our sun is just now returning to what it’s historically done many times over.\n\nOur sun is right now having what we consider an average cycle, it’s not even a big cycle. We’ve had even bigger cycles than this where there’s a lot more activity – it’s just that the cycle we had prior to it, that lasted a full decade, was the anomaly. It’s given us a sense of complacency that our star is just a light bulb in the sky and it doesn’t really affect anything, and that’s a problem.\n\nHow worried should we be about a solar eruption on the magnitude of the Carrington event that struck Earth in 1859? That storm wreaked havoc with even rudimentary electronics, causing fires in telegraph stations, and the world is vastly more dependent on electronics today.\n\nWe’ve learned so much about how these events occur and how they affect our infrastructure, and we now have lots more warning systems. The power grids are the big thing that we worry about. Earth’s magnetic field wiggles a lot during these storms, which induces currents into the ground. Those currents are trying to move in rock, like a traffic jam on the freeway, but then they come across the power lines coupled to the ground that are these free energy highways. The problem is our transformers and our grid systems aren’t designed to handle that energy, and so it can overload the system pretty rapidly.\n\nWhat we’re learning to do is to decouple the transformers from the ground during these storms and free float, which is dangerous, of course. But it’s maybe a better solution temporarily than having the grids connected to the ground. Some of these systems were tested during the G5 storm in May 2024 and they did very well. There were some issues, but it wasn’t catastrophic. That was a nice, gentle test of some of these new technologies that we have in place.\n\nOur focus now is shifting towards GPS and navigation systems. We had a huge scare with the precision agriculture community, because last October a storm happened during planting season. This event was affecting peanut farmers because they have to have very precise geolocation, because their peanuts are underground and they can’t see them. So we’re having to hurry up and pivot as these new technologies come online faster than we’re able to figure out how to mitigate issues that might arise.\n\nDuring solar maximum, storms on the sun blast out plumes of charged particles NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center/SDO\n\nThose are all problems on Earth, where we have an atmosphere. How different, and dangerous, is it for spacecraft and astronauts that go to the moon, or Mars?\n\nOur atmosphere protects us unlike anything else. When you look at pictures of the sun taken from the ground, all you see is this barren gold ball, and that’s because the atmosphere absorbs all the sunlight that’s radiating in those higher energies. That light would damage our skin and give us radiation sickness if it was allowed to reach the ground. But when we go to the moon, which has no atmosphere, suddenly we have to be very protected against all that radiation. On top of that, we have to be protected from what we call radiation storms, which are high-energy particles being shot at us. Researchers are currently figuring out the best way to do this, such as burying lunar bases deep underground or developing magnetic force fields.\n\nAstronauts really are radiation workers, which has been known for a long time in low Earth orbit, but they’re going to be radiation workers on steroids when we get to the moon, because they’re going to be so susceptible.\n\nThat’s one of the areas with space weather where we have actually gotten very lucky so far. Back in the Apollo era, in 1972, there was a particle radiation storm that was so intense that, if astronauts had been on the moon at the time, they would have likely died. They would have gotten such bad radiation poisoning that they would have probably died right there in their space suits. If they had been there, it would have completely changed the landscape in terms of space exploration. Right now, it’s like we’re still blissfully unaware that these dangers exist.\n\nThere’s an atmosphere on Mars, but it’s incredibly tenuous. Once again, radiation storms reach all the way to the ground. We’re not going to be able to be like Matt Damon in the movie The Martian, hiding behind his little potatoes and cowering. In reality, we’re going to have to live underground, and that poses a lot of problems for us.",

      "personality_title": "Why northern lights are brighter and more visible now",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The northern lights, or aurora borealis, have been unusually bright and visible farther south than usual in recent years. This is linked to the sun’s natural 11-year cycle, which influences solar activity and space weather.\n\n**What happened** – Space weather physicist Tamitha Skov explains that the sun is currently at the peak of its solar cycle, causing more eruptions of charged particles. These particles interact with Earth’s magnetic field, creating brighter and more frequent auroras. Additionally, Earth’s magnetic field is slowly weakening, allowing auroras to be seen in new places.\n\n**Impact** – This increased solar activity is normal for the sun but unusual compared to the quiet cycles before it. The bright auroras are a visible sign of this activity. The particles from the sun can also affect power grids, GPS, and satellites, posing challenges for technology and astronauts. New forecasting methods and protective measures have helped reduce risks, as shown in a recent solar storm test.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists and engineers will continue improving space weather forecasts and technology protections. There is also ongoing work to protect astronauts from radiation on the moon and Mars, including ideas like underground shelters and magnetic shields.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The sun’s natural cycle is making northern lights brighter and more common, while advances in space weather science help protect Earth’s technology and future space explorers.",
      "personality_title_fr": "Pourquoi les aurores boréales sont plus brillantes et plus visibles aujourd'hui",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les aurores boréales, ou lumières du Nord, sont devenues exceptionnellement brillantes et visibles plus au sud ces dernières années. Cela est lié au cycle naturel de 11 ans du soleil, qui influence l’activité solaire et la météo spatiale.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – La physicienne de la météo spatiale Tamitha Skov explique que le soleil est actuellement au pic de son cycle solaire, provoquant plus d’éruptions de particules chargées. Ces particules interagissent avec le champ magnétique de la Terre, créant des aurores plus brillantes et fréquentes. De plus, le champ magnétique terrestre s’affaiblit lentement, permettant aux aurores d’être vues dans de nouveaux endroits.\n\n**Impact** – Cette activité solaire accrue est normale pour le soleil mais inhabituelle comparée aux cycles calmes précédents. Les aurores brillantes sont un signe visible de cette activité. Les particules du soleil peuvent aussi affecter les réseaux électriques, le GPS et les satellites, posant des défis pour la technologie et les astronautes. De nouvelles méthodes de prévision et protections ont aidé à réduire les risques, comme montré lors d’une récente tempête solaire.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques et ingénieurs continueront d’améliorer les prévisions météo spatiale et les protections technologiques. Des travaux sont aussi en cours pour protéger les astronautes contre les radiations sur la lune et Mars, avec des idées comme des abris souterrains et des boucliers magnétiques.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le cycle naturel du soleil rend les aurores plus brillantes et fréquentes, tandis que les progrès en météo spatiale protègent la technologie terrestre et les futurs explorateurs de l’espace.",
      "personality_title_es": "Por qué las auroras boreales son más brillantes y visibles ahora",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Las auroras boreales, o luces del norte, han sido inusualmente brillantes y visibles más al sur en los últimos años. Esto está relacionado con el ciclo natural de 11 años del sol, que afecta la actividad solar y el clima espacial.\n\n**Qué pasó** – La física del clima espacial Tamitha Skov explica que el sol está en el pico de su ciclo solar, causando más erupciones de partículas cargadas. Estas partículas interactúan con el campo magnético de la Tierra, creando auroras más brillantes y frecuentes. Además, el campo magnético terrestre se está debilitando lentamente, lo que permite ver auroras en nuevos lugares.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta mayor actividad solar es normal para el sol, pero inusual comparada con ciclos anteriores más tranquilos. Las auroras brillantes son una señal visible de esta actividad. Las partículas solares también pueden afectar redes eléctricas, GPS y satélites, presentando desafíos para la tecnología y los astronautas. Nuevos métodos de pronóstico y protección han ayudado a reducir riesgos, como se vio en una prueba reciente.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Científicos e ingenieros seguirán mejorando los pronósticos del clima espacial y las protecciones tecnológicas. También trabajan en proteger a los astronautas de la radiación en la luna y Marte, con ideas como refugios subterráneos y escudos magnéticos.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – El ciclo natural del sol hace que las auroras sean más brillantes y comunes, mientras que los avances en el clima espacial protegen la tecnología y a los futuros exploradores espaciales.",
