      "content": "Dundee and US surgeons achieve world-first stroke surgery using robot\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Graham Fraser BBC Scotland Share Save\n\nUniversity of Dundee Prof Iris Grunwald demonstrates the technology which she says now shows that a specialist doesn't need to be \"in the same hospital, or even in the same country, to help you\"\n\nDoctors from Scotland and the US have completed what is thought to be a world-first stroke procedure using a robot. Prof Iris Grunwald, of the University of Dundee, performed the remote thrombectomy - the removal of blood clots after a stroke - on a human cadaver that had been donated to medical science. The professor was at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, while the body she was operating on while using the machine was at a university facility. Hours later, Ricardo Hanel - a neurosurgeon in Florida - used the technology to carry out the first transatlantic surgery from his Jacksonville base on a human body in Dundee over 4,000 miles (6,400km) away.\n\nUniversity of Dundee The team watch on as Ricardo Hanel performs the procedure from Florida\n\nThe team has called it a potential \"game changer\" if it becomes approved for use on patients. The medics believe this technology could transform stroke care, as a delay in accessing specialist treatment can have a direct impact on the chances of recovery. Prof Grunwald said: \"It felt as if we were witnessing the first glimpse of the future. \"Where previously this was thought to be science fiction, we demonstrated that every step of the procedure can already be done.\" The University of Dundee is the global training centre of the World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment, and is the only place in the UK where doctors can operate on cadavers with liquid which mimics human blood circulated in the vessels. \"This was the first time that we could perform the whole mechanical thrombectomy procedure in a real human body to show that all steps of the procedure are possible,\" said Prof Grunwald. Juliet Bouverie, the chief executive of the Stroke Association charity, told BBC News the transatlantic procedure was \"a remarkable innovation\". She added: \"For too long, people living in remote and rural areas have been deprived of access to thrombectomy. \"Robotics like this could rebalance the inequity which exists in stroke treatment across the UK.\"\n\nUniversity of Dundee Prof Grunwald says the new technology \"could make expert stroke treatment available to everyone\"\n\nIn the experiment, fluid which mimics human blood was used in four different cadavers. The subjects, who donated their bodies to science, died within the past three years and were then embalmed. Both the Dundee and Florida procedures were carried out last month using robotics from the Lithuanian firm Sentante. While there have been remote thrombectomies carried out before on a silicon model, a 3D printed replica and on an animal, this is thought to have been the first procedure on a human body. The team now hope to take part in clinical trials next year.\n\nHow does the technology work?\n\nAn ischaemic stroke occurs when an artery is blocked by a clot. This cuts off blood and oxygen supply to the brain, and brain cells lose function and die. The best treatment is a thrombectomy, where a specialist uses catheters and wires to remove the clot. But what happens when a patient can't get to a specialist who can do the procedure? Prof Grunwald said the experiment demonstrated a robot could be connected to the same catheters and wires a surgeon would normally use, and a medic who is with the patient could simply attach the wires. The surgeon, in another location, could then hold and move their own wires, and the robot then carries out exactly the same movements in real time on the patient to carry out the thrombectomy. The patient would be in a hospital operating room, while the doctor could carry out the procedure using the Sentante machine from anywhere - even their own home. Prof Grunwald and Ricardo Hanel could see live X-rays of the body in the experiments, and monitor progress in real time, with the Dundee expert saying it took only took 20 minutes of training. Tech giants Nvidia and Ericsson were involved in the project to ensure the connectivity of the robot. Dr Hanel said: \"To operate from the US to Scotland with a 120 millisecond lag - a blink of an eye - is truly remarkable.\"\n\nSentante In this earlier demonstration of the technology, it shows how a doctor - who could be anywhere - can move the wires, and the technology records the movements\n\nSentante In this same demo, the robot - which could be attached to a patient - replicates the movement of the remote surgeon\n\nThe future of stroke treatment",

      "summary": "Scientists have found that keratin, the protein in hair and skin, can repair and protect tooth enamel. The material forms a mineralized layer that halts decay and restores strength, outperforming traditional fluoride. Made from sustainable sources like hair, it could soon be available in toothpaste or gels. The discovery could transform dentistry by turning waste into a powerful tool for regeneration.",
      "content": "A new approach to oral care may come from an unexpected source: your own hair. Researchers have found that toothpaste made from keratin, a protein naturally present in hair, skin, and wool, could both protect and repair damaged teeth while offering a sustainable alternative to traditional dental treatments.\n\nScientists from King's College London discovered that keratin can rebuild tooth enamel and halt the early stages of decay. When keratin interacts with the minerals found in saliva, it forms a coating that closely replicates the composition and protective function of natural enamel.\n\nDr. Sherif Elsharkawy, senior author and consultant in prosthodontics at King's College London, explained: \"Unlike bones and hair, enamel does not regenerate, once it is lost, it's gone forever.\"\n\nProtecting Teeth from Erosion and Cavities\n\nEveryday habits, from drinking acidic beverages to poor brushing routines, wear away enamel over time. This erosion can lead to sensitivity, discomfort, and eventually tooth loss. While fluoride toothpaste helps slow this process, the keratin-based formulation in the new study went further, completely preventing it in laboratory tests.\n\nKeratin creates a dense, mineralized barrier over the tooth's surface, blocking the nerve channels responsible for sensitivity. This not only protects against further damage but also provides immediate relief from discomfort, addressing both cause and symptom.\n\nThe researchers envision the treatment being available in two forms: a daily-use toothpaste or a professional gel applied by dentists, similar to nail varnish. According to the team, keratin-based enamel repair products could be accessible to the public within two to three years.\n\nHow Keratin Helps Teeth Heal Themselves\n\nIn the study, published in Advanced Healthcare Materials, scientists extracted keratin from wool and applied it to tooth surfaces. When exposed to the natural minerals present in saliva, the protein organized itself into a crystal-like structure that mimicked real enamel.\n\nOver time, this microscopic framework continued to attract calcium and phosphate ions, gradually forming a durable, enamel-like layer. The finding marks an important milestone in regenerative dentistry and brings researchers closer to treatments that can rebuild the tooth's protective shell rather than just patching damage.\n\nSustainable, Natural, and Clinically Effective\n\nSara Gamea, PhD researcher at King's College London and the study's first author, said: \"Keratin offers a transformative alternative to current dental treatments. Not only is it sustainably sourced from biological waste materials like hair and skin, it also eliminates the need for traditional plastic resins, commonly used in restorative dentistry, which are toxic and less durable. Keratin also looks much more natural than these treatments, as it can more closely match the color of the original tooth.\"\n\nThe research addresses growing concerns about the environmental impact of dental materials and the long-term use of fluoride. By using recycled biological materials, this approach could make dental care more eco-friendly while reducing dependence on synthetic compounds.\n\nA New Era of Biotech Dentistry\n\n\"This technology bridges the gap between biology and dentistry, providing an eco-friendly biomaterial that mirrors natural processes,\" said Gamea.\n\nDr. Elsharkawy added: \"We are entering an exciting era where biotechnology allows us to not just treat symptoms but restore biological function using the body's own materials. With further development and the right industry partnerships, we may soon be growing stronger, healthier smiles from something as simple as a haircut.\"\n\nThe work received support from the Wellcome Trust Seed Award, King's College London, the Academy of Medical Sciences 'Starter Grants for Clinical Lecturers', and the National Institute of Health Research.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Tooth enamel is the hard outer layer that protects our teeth, but it cannot heal once damaged. Everyday habits like drinking acidic drinks and not brushing well can wear enamel away, causing pain and cavities. Most toothpastes use fluoride to slow this damage, but it does not fully fix enamel.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists at King's College London discovered that keratin, a protein found in hair, skin, and wool, can rebuild and protect tooth enamel. They made a toothpaste using keratin extracted from wool. When applied to teeth, keratin interacts with minerals in saliva to form a strong, enamel-like layer that stops decay.

When blocked, these enzymes cause the androgen receptor to collapse, killing cancer cells and enhancing the effects of drugs like enzalutamide. They also disrupt the cancer’s energy system, striking it on multiple fronts. This breakthrough could open a new path to overcoming drug resistance in advanced prostate cancer.",
      "content": "An international team of researchers has identified a new weakness in prostate cancer cells that could lead to more effective treatments for one of the most common cancers among men.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), was led by scientists from Flinders University in Australia and South China University of Technology. Their findings highlight two enzymes, PDIA1 and PDIA5, that play a key role in helping prostate cancer cells grow, survive, and resist existing treatments.\n\nEnzymes That Protect Cancer Cells\n\nAccording to the researchers, PDIA1 and PDIA5 act like molecular bodyguards for the androgen receptor (AR), a protein that drives prostate cancer growth. When these enzymes are blocked, the AR loses stability and breaks apart, causing cancer cells to die and tumors to shrink in both lab cultures and animal models.\n\nThe team also discovered that combining drugs that inhibit PDIA1 and PDIA5 with enzalutamide, a standard medication for prostate cancer, made the treatment significantly more effective.\n\n\"We've discovered a previously unknown mechanism that prostate cancer cells use to protect the androgen receptor, which is a key driver of the disease,\" explains senior author Professor Luke Selth, Head of Prostate Cancer Research and Co-Director of the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute's Cancer Impact program.\n\n\"By targeting these enzymes, we can destabilize the AR and make tumors more vulnerable to existing therapies like enzalutamide.\"\n\nA Promising Combination Therapy\n\nLead author Professor Jianling Xie, who began the research at Flinders University, said the combination therapy worked well in both patient-derived tumor samples and mouse models, showing strong potential for clinical use.\n\n\"This is an exciting step forward,\" says Dr. Xie, now based at South China University of Technology. \"Our findings show that PDIA1 and PDIA5 are not just helpers of cancer growth but they're also promising targets for new treatments that could work alongside existing drugs.\"\n\nDisrupting Cancer's Energy Supply\n\nThe study also revealed that PDIA1 and PDIA5 do more than just protect the AR. They help cancer cells manage stress and maintain their energy production systems. When the enzymes are blocked, the mitochondria -- the cell's power generators -- become damaged, leading to oxidative stress that further weakens the cancer cells.\n\n\"This dual impact of hitting both the AR and the cancer's energy supply makes these enzymes especially attractive targets,\" adds Dr. Xie. \"It's like cutting off both the fuel and the engine at the same time.\"\n\nNext Steps Toward Safer Treatments\n\nProfessor Selth notes that while current PDIA1 and PDIA5 inhibitors are promising, they still need to be refined for patient use. Some existing compounds can affect healthy cells, so future studies will focus on designing safer and more selective versions.\n\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Although treatments such as hormone therapy and AR-targeting drugs have greatly improved survival rates, resistance to these therapies remains a major challenge. This new discovery may help overcome that resistance and improve treatment options for men with advanced prostate cancer.\n\nThe research received support from Cancer Council SA, Cancer Council NSW, the Flinders Foundation, the Movember Foundation, the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, The Hospital Research Foundation, Cancer Australia, Masonic Charities Trust, the Australian Research Council, and several international funding organizations.",

      "content": "A new study from Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City reports that a personalized vitamin D 3 treatment plan for patients who have suffered a heart attack can greatly reduce their chances of another one.\n\nIn a large randomized clinical trial, researchers found that managing patients' vitamin D levels through a \"target-to-treat\" approach -- where blood levels were monitored and dosages were adjusted to reach an optimal range -- cut the likelihood of a second heart attack by 50%.\n\nThe findings were presented on Nov. 9 at the 2025 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in New Orleans.\n\nEncouraging Early Results from Intermountain Researchers\n\nThese results are very encouraging, said Heidi May, PhD, cardiovascular epidemiologist at Intermountain Health and the study's principal investigator. \"We observed no adverse outcomes when giving patients higher doses of vitamin D 3 supplementation, and to significantly reduce the risk of another heart attack, which are exciting results,\" said Dr. May. \"We're excited with these results but know we have further work to do to validate these findings.\"\n\nAccording to researchers, the results carry global importance, as between one-half and two-thirds of people worldwide have low levels of vitamin D.\n\nIn the past, most individuals received sufficient vitamin D through sunlight exposure. Today, with lifestyle changes and medical advice aimed at reducing skin cancer risk, people spend less time in the sun and must rely more on dietary supplements such as vitamin D 3 to maintain healthy levels.\n\nFrom Observation to Precision Treatment\n\nLow vitamin D levels have long been linked to poor cardiovascular outcomes in observational studies. However, earlier clinical trials that provided standard supplementation doses failed to show measurable reductions in heart disease risk. Intermountain scientists wanted to test a different idea: rather than giving everyone the same dose, what if supplementation was adjusted to reach a specific, healthy vitamin D level?\n\n\"Previous studies just gave patients supplementation without regularly checking blood levels of vitamin D to determine what supplementation achieved,\" said Dr. May. \"With more targeted treatment, when we checked exactly how supplementation was working and made adjustments, we found that patients had their risk of another heart attack cut in half.\"\n\nInside the TARGET-D Clinical Trial\n\nThe Intermountain study, called the TARGET-D trial, ran from April 2017 to May 2023 and included 630 patients who had suffered a heart attack within a month of enrolling. Participants were followed until March 2025 to monitor cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one received no vitamin D management, and the other underwent active, targeted vitamin D 3 treatment.\n\nThe goal for the treatment group was to raise blood vitamin D levels to above 40 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). At the start, 85% of participants had vitamin D 3 levels below that threshold (<40 ng/mL).\n\nDosing, Monitoring, and Results\n\nMore than half of the patients receiving targeted therapy required an initial dose of 5,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D 3 , compared to typical supplement recommendations of 600-800 IU.\n\nVitamin D blood levels were checked annually for those maintaining healthy levels. Patients with lower levels were tested every three months and had their dosage adjusted until reaching the 40 ng/mL target. Afterward, their levels were monitored once a year.\n\nResearchers tracked major cardiac events (MACE), including heart attacks, strokes, heart failure hospitalizations, or deaths. Out of 630 participants, 107 experienced such events. While there was no significant difference in the overall risk of MACE between the two groups, the chance of having a second heart attack was cut in half among those receiving targeted vitamin D treatment.\n\nNext Steps for Heart and Vitamin D Research\n\nResearchers plan to expand their work with a larger clinical trial to confirm and build upon these findings.\n\nA larger study group will allow us to more fully evaluate whether targeted vitamin D management can reduce not only repeat heart attacks but also other forms of cardiovascular disease, said Dr. May.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many people who survive a heart attack face a high risk of having another one. Low vitamin D levels have been linked to heart problems, but past studies using the same vitamin D dose for everyone did not show clear benefits.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City conducted a study called TARGET-D with 630 heart attack survivors. They gave one group personalized vitamin D3 treatment, adjusting doses to reach healthy blood levels above 40 nanograms per milliliter. The other group received no special vitamin D care. Over several years, the group with personalized vitamin D had their chance of a second heart attack cut by 50%.\n\n**Impact** – This study is important because it shows that checking vitamin D levels and adjusting doses is more effective than giving the same amount to everyone. It also highlights that many people worldwide have low vitamin D, partly because of less sun exposure today. This targeted approach could improve heart care for millions.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers plan to run a larger clinical trial to confirm these results and see if personalized vitamin D treatment can also reduce other heart problems like strokes or heart failure.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Adjusting vitamin D3 doses based on blood tests can halve the risk of a second heart attack in survivors.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les personnes ayant déjà eu une crise cardiaque risquent souvent d’en avoir une autre. De faibles niveaux de vitamine D sont liés à des problèmes cardiaques, mais les études précédentes donnant la même dose à tous n’avaient pas montré de bénéfices clairs.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs d’Intermountain Health à Salt Lake City ont mené l’étude TARGET-D avec 630 survivants de crise cardiaque. Un groupe a reçu un traitement personnalisé en vitamine D3, avec des doses ajustées pour atteindre un taux sanguin sain au-dessus de 40 nanogrammes par millilitre. L’autre groupe n’a pas bénéficié de soins spécifiques en vitamine D. Après plusieurs années, le groupe avec traitement personnalisé a vu son risque de deuxième crise réduit de moitié.\n\n**Impact** – Cette étude est importante car elle montre que vérifier les niveaux de vitamine D et ajuster les doses est plus efficace que de donner la même quantité à tous. Elle souligne aussi que beaucoup de personnes dans le monde ont une carence en vitamine D, en partie à cause d’une moindre exposition au soleil aujourd’hui. Cette méthode ciblée pourrait améliorer les soins cardiaques pour des millions de personnes.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs prévoient un essai clinique plus large pour confirmer ces résultats et vérifier si le traitement personnalisé à la vitamine D peut aussi réduire d’autres problèmes cardiaques comme les AVC ou l’insuffisance cardiaque.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Ajuster les doses de vitamine D3 selon les analyses sanguines peut réduire de moitié le risque de deuxième crise cardiaque chez les survivants.\n",
