      "summary": "A massive, well-preserved impact crater has been uncovered in Guangdong, revealing the signature of a powerful meteorite strike during the Holocene. Measuring 900 meters across, it dwarfs other known craters from the same era. Shock-damaged quartz confirms the intense forces involved. Its survival in a high-erosion environment makes it a geological rarity.",
      "content": "A recently uncovered and unusually intact impact crater is offering scientists new insights into how objects from space have struck Earth throughout its history.\n\nResearchers from Shanghai and Guangzhou, China, describe their findings in the journal Matter and Radiation at Extremes (AIP Publishing). They identified the feature as the Jinlin crater, a bowl-shaped structure positioned on a hillside and protected within a thick layer of weathered granite.\n\nA Rare and Young Crater in Southern China\n\nThe crater lies in Zhaoqing, Guangdong Province, and is one of only about 200 confirmed impact sites on the planet. Its age places it among the youngest known. Soil erosion measurements indicate that it likely formed during the early-to-mid Holocene -- the geological interval that began at the end of the last ice age roughly 11,700 years ago. With a width of 900 meters, it is the largest verified crater from this period -- surpassing Russia's Macha crater, which measures 300 meters and was previously considered the biggest Holocene impact site.\n\n\"This discovery shows that the scale of impacts of small extraterrestrial objects on the Earth in the Holocene is far greater than previously recorded,\" said author Ming Chen.\n\nClues About the Object That Struck Earth\n\nThe team concluded that the object responsible was a meteorite rather than a comet. A cometary collision would have produced a much larger crater, likely at least 10 kilometers across. What remains unknown is whether the meteorite was composed of stone or iron, a distinction that requires further study.\n\nRemarkable Preservation and Shock Features in Quartz\n\nOne of the most unexpected aspects of Jinlin is how well it has survived. The area experiences heavy rainfall, strong monsoons, and high humidity, all of which rapidly erode rock. Even so, the crater remains clear and well defined. Inside its granite layers, researchers discovered numerous grains of quartz marked by tiny structures known as planar deformation features. These microscopic signatures are widely recognized by geologists as a hallmark of an impact event.\n\n\"On the Earth, the formation of planar deformation features in quartz is only from the intense shockwaves generated by celestial body impacts, and its formation pressure ranges from 10 to 35 gigapascals, which is a shock effect that cannot be produced by any geological process of the Earth itself,\" said Chen.\n\nSignificance for Understanding Earth's Impact History\n\nAlthough every location on Earth is thought to have had similar chances of being hit by an extraterrestrial object over time, the evidence of past collisions does not survive equally well. Rock types, climate, and erosion patterns vary across the planet, allowing many ancient craters to vanish entirely. The survival of the Jinlin crater therefore provides an unusually clear window into events that shaped the recent geological past.\n\n\"The impact crater is a true record of Earth's impact history,\" said Chen. \"The discovery of the Earth impact crater can provide us with a more objective basis for understanding the distribution, geological evolution, and impact history and regulation of small extraterrestrial bodies.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists study craters formed when space objects hit Earth to learn about our planet’s history. Most craters from recent times are small or hard to find because weather and erosion wear them away.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers in China found a big crater called Jinlin in Guangdong Province. It is 900 meters wide and formed during the Holocene, the time after the last ice age about 11,700 years ago. This crater is much larger than other craters from the same period, like Russia’s Macha crater, which is only 300 meters wide. The scientists confirmed it was made by a meteorite impact by studying quartz minerals inside the crater.\n\n**Impact** – The Jinlin crater is very unusual because it has stayed well-preserved despite heavy rain and strong weather that usually erodes rocks quickly. This gives scientists a rare chance to study a young and large impact site. It helps them understand how often and how big space objects have hit Earth in recent times. The crater also shows clear signs of the powerful shockwaves caused by the impact.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to study more details about the meteorite, such as whether it was made of stone or metal.

      "summary": "Scientists have finally confirmed a powerful coronal mass ejection from another star, using LOFAR radio data paired with XMM-Newton’s X-ray insights. The eruption blasted into space at extraordinary speeds, strong enough to strip atmospheres from close-orbiting worlds. This suggests planets around active red dwarfs may be far less hospitable than hoped.",
      "content": "Astronomers working with the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton observatory and the LOFAR radio telescope have obtained clear evidence of a violent burst of material hurled into space by a distant star. The outflow was strong enough that any nearby planet in its path would likely have its atmosphere stripped away.\n\nThis burst was identified as a coronal mass ejection (CME), a type of eruption frequently produced by the Sun. During a CME, enormous quantities of charged particles and plasma are pushed outward from the star, filling the surrounding space. These dramatic outbursts drive what we call space weather, influence events such as auroras on Earth, and can gradually erode the atmospheres of neighboring planets.\n\nScientists had long suspected that other stars generate their own CMEs, yet convincing proof had remained elusive. That gap has now been filled.\n\n\"Astronomers have wanted to spot a CME on another star for decades,\" says Joe Callingham of the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON), author of the new research published in Nature. \"Previous findings have inferred that they exist, or hinted at their presence, but haven't actually confirmed that material has definitively escaped out into space. We've now managed to do this for the first time.\"\n\nA Rare Radio Signal Marks Material Escaping the Star\n\nAs a CME pushes outward through the outer layers of a star and into the surrounding region, it generates a shock wave along with a sudden burst of radio waves (a form of light). Joe and his colleagues detected this brief, intense radio signal and traced it to a star located around 130 light-years away.\n\n\"This kind of radio signal just wouldn't exist unless material had completely left the star's bubble of powerful magnetism,\" adds Joe. \"In other words: it's caused by a CME.\"\n\nA Hyperactive Red Dwarf With Planet-Scorching Power\n\nThe star producing the eruption is a red dwarf, which is a much cooler, dimmer, and smaller type of star than the Sun. It differs from our Sun in several key ways: it has about half the Sun's mass, it rotates 20 times faster, and its magnetic field is an estimated 300 times stronger. Most planets discovered in the Milky Way orbit stars of this type.\n\nThe radio signal was detected with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) thanks to new data-processing techniques developed by co-authors Cyril Tasse and Philippe Zarka at the Observatoire de Paris-PSL. The team then relied on ESA's XMM-Newton to measure the star's temperature, rotation, and X-ray brightness. These details were necessary to interpret the radio burst and determine the nature of the eruption.\n\n\"We needed the sensitivity and frequency of LOFAR to detect the radio waves,\" says co-author David Konijn, a PhD student working with Joe at ASTRON. \"And without XMM-Newton, we wouldn't have been able to determine the CME's motion or put it in a solar context, both crucial for proving what we'd found. Neither telescope alone would have been enough -- we needed both.\"\n\nTheir measurements revealed that the CME was traveling at roughly 2400 km per second. CMEs that fast occur in only about 1 out of every 2000 events on the Sun. The burst was also dense and energetic enough that any planet orbiting close to this star could have its atmosphere entirely stripped away.\n\nImplications for Life Around Red Dwarfs\n\nThe ability of such a CME to remove atmospheres is an important factor in the search for life beyond the Solar System. A planet's habitability is often tied to whether it falls within its star's 'habitable zone', where liquid water can persist on the surface of a planet with the right atmospheric conditions. The concept is similar to the Goldilocks idea: too close is too hot, too far is too cold, and the middle region is potentially just right.\n\nHowever, a star that frequently unleashes strong eruptions and extreme space weather may rob even a well-positioned planet of its atmosphere. A world exposed to repeated high-energy CMEs could be reduced to bare rock, even if it orbits at a distance normally considered favorable for life.\n\n\"This work opens up a new observational frontier for studying and understanding eruptions and space weather around other stars,\" adds Henrik Eklund, an ESA research fellow based at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, The Netherlands.\n\n\"We're no longer limited to extrapolating our understanding of the Sun's CMEs to other stars. It seems that intense space weather may be even more extreme around smaller stars -- the primary hosts of potentially habitable exoplanets. This has important implications for how these planets keep hold of their atmospheres and possibly remain habitable over time.\"\n\nExpanding the Study of Extreme Space Weather\n\nThis discovery also deepens our knowledge of space weather more broadly, an area long studied by ESA through missions including SOHO, the Proba series, Swarm, and Solar Orbiter.\n\nXMM-Newton remains a key observatory for examining high-energy environments throughout the Universe. Since its launch in 1999, it has explored galactic cores, studied stellar evolution, investigated regions around black holes, and observed bursts of intense radiation from distant stars and galaxies.\n\n\"XMM-Newton is now helping us discover how CMEs vary by star, something that's not only interesting in our study of stars and our Sun, but also our hunt for habitable worlds around other stars,\" says ESA XMM-Newton Project Scientist Erik Kuulkers. \"It also demonstrates the immense power of collaboration, which underpins all successful science. The discovery was a true team effort, and resolves the decades-long search for CMEs beyond the Sun.\"",
