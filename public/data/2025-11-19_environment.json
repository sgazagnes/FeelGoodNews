The designation means the areas, including one in part of the Amazon, will have their culture and environment protected under Brazilian law - though this is not always enforced. The move follows similar actions from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government recognised Indigenous possession of 11 territories last year. \"Each and every indigenous territory in Brazil is a reason to celebrate and is a reason for us to feel happy,\" Dinamam Tuxu from the group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) told the BBC at COP30.\n\nThe latest measure will be formalised through a presidential decree. Mr Tuxu said APIB wants more lands to be recognised legally, giving groups the right to control what happens to the land within the borders. \"Indigenous peoples today protect 82% of the world's biodiversity. If you demarcate indigenous lands, you guarantee this area will be protected,\" he said. \"The traditional way of life of indigenous peoples protects the lands and automatically guarantees global warming will be tackled. Consequently the entire humanity benefits from it,\" he added.\n\nDinamam Tuxu from the group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil said he is happy that more indigenous peoples are represented at COP30\n\nSome indigenous groups are attacked when they try to defend their land from cattle ranchers or groups trying to cut down trees for agriculture. On Sunday an indigenous leader from the Guarani Kaiowá community in the south of Brazil was killed during an attack, according to Survival International. Vicente Fernandes Vilhalva, 36, was shot in the head when gunmen surrounded the village, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to Survival International. Thousands protested on Saturday outside the UN's annual climate conference, with some carrying signs reading \"demarcation now\".",

During this time, Indigenous peoples protested to demand more protection for their lands, which are important for preserving nature and their cultures.\n\n**What happened** – The Brazilian government, led by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, officially created 10 new Indigenous territories. These areas, including parts of the Amazon rainforest, will now be legally protected to help preserve the environment and Indigenous ways of life. This decision was announced during COP30 and will be confirmed by a presidential decree.\n\n**Impact** – Indigenous lands cover a large part of the world’s biodiversity, meaning they are home to many plants and animals. Protecting these territories helps fight climate change because Indigenous people take care of the forests and land in traditional ways. This move supports both the environment and Indigenous communities, giving them more control over their lands.\n\n**What's next step** – The government will finalize the protections through official rules, and Indigenous groups hope more lands will be recognized in the future.

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 18 November 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03721-1The world needs to move towards an approach to measure well-being rather than economic growth. Here’s how that can happen.",
      "content": "Gross domestic product (GDP) was never designed to be a measure of societal well-being. It tracks only market transactions, conflates costs and benefits, and ignores the distribution of income, the contributions of household labour and volunteer work, and social and environmental costs and benefits.\n\nIn the decades after the Second World War, GDP growth functioned as a reasonable proxy for well-being when rebuilding economies and increasing production and consumption were the main priorities. However, since about 1950, which some call the Anthropocene era, ecological limits, inequality and declining social cohesion have restricted further improvements in well-being. At the same time, the rapid development of artificial intelligence promises fresh opportunities and challenges.\n\nDegrowth can work — here’s how science can help\n\nMeasuring and modelling what truly matters, not just market transactions, is now essential. Processes are under way to develop indicators that move beyond GDP. In May, the United Nations secretary-general António Guterres appointed a High-Level Expert Group to develop such measures, with a focus on balancing economic, social and environmental dimensions of well-being. This initiative builds on the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): target 19 of SDG17 commits governments to adopt beyond-GDP metrics by 2030.\n\nYet progress remains slow. Overcoming decades of structures built around GDP is difficult. Nonetheless, several governments, including those of New Zealand, Scotland, Wales and Bhutan, have experimented with alternatives to GDP1 (see also go.nature.com/3ktuvhv). Others should follow suit, but it will be a steep climb.\n\nShifting all societies from a narrow focus on GDP growth to a comprehensive understanding of the multiple factors that support well-being and prosperity, and of how these factors interact over space and time, demands consensus on another approach2. Over the past seven decades, researchers and institutions have proposed hundreds of alternatives to GDP.\n\nParadoxically, this proliferation has helped GDP to keep its privileged status, by creating the impression that there is little agreement on what sustainable and inclusive well-being means or how to measure it. In fact, there is much that these approaches do agree on.\n\nHere, we identify areas of common ground and propose four ways forward: universally adopting the goal of sustainable and inclusive well-being; establishing agreed metrics to evaluate progress towards this goal; developing models that incorporate the drivers and dynamics of well-being; and addressing institutionalized societal ‘addictions’ that reinforce unsustainable behaviours.\n\nEmbrace sustainable and inclusive well-being\n\nThe concept of sustainable and inclusive well-being — encompassing the well-being of all people and of the ecosystems that sustain life — is emerging as a widely accepted overarching policy goal that can provide common ground for beyond-GDP metrics, models and policies.\n\nBy assigning a central role to natural ecosystems and planetary boundaries, the concept acknowledges that human prosperity depends on healthy ecological systems. Respecting ecological limits by constraining the material scale of the economy is therefore a precondition for lasting well-being. It also demands that human societies prevent significant harm to other species, protect the rights of future generations and guarantee that all people today have access to essential resources, services and participatory forms of decision-making.\n\nMarket workers in Kenya. Employment is a core factor in many indicators of well-being.Credit: Elen Marlen/Getty\n\nA 2009 report on the measurement of economic performance and social progress, chaired by economist Joseph Stiglitz, laid the groundwork for moving beyond GDP3. Since then, international bodies, including the UN, the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), have progressively adopted this conceptual foundation. Full international enforcement should follow; however, this might depend on a more-receptive US administration and stronger demand from civil society.\n\nAgree on well-being indicators\n\nConverging on an approach to evaluating sustainable and inclusive well-being is important if policymakers and organizations such as the UN are to embed these measures into official reporting and budgetary processes. Studies suggest that this is possible.\n\nAlthough more than 200 beyond-GDP indicators have been proposed, they share many similarities. These indicators often use different terminology to describe contributors to sustainable and inclusive well-being4. For example, ‘health’ might refer to mental health, physical health, health care, child welfare or any of more than 400 variants. Semantic modelling of the components of each indicator, which looks at the similarity between them, nevertheless reveals a high degree of agreement5. Nineteen key components capture a large proportion of the similarity (see ‘Well-being components’).\n\nWell-being components These 19 core factors are common to most beyond-GDP indicators5. Human Life satisfaction Health Life expectancy at birth Education Social Crime Civic engagement Governance Income equality Gender equality Built Housing Infrastructure Financial security Employment Per capita consumption Business health Natural Natural capital Water quality Air quality Greenhouse-gas emissions\n\nResearchers and policymakers, led by an international convening body such as the UN, should now establish a core set of around 20 components to serve as the backbone of national statistical reporting and UN frameworks. The UN High-Level Expert Group and the ongoing update of the SDGs are already advancing the agenda. The expert group has committed to an inclusive process that invites contributions from all stakeholders.\n\nInterested parties are encouraged to submit ideas and insights to help strengthen the emerging global consensus (see go.nature.com/4gcebvr). This month, the expert group launched an online consultation about its progress, and is expected to present its recommendations in the first half of 2026, which falls within the 80th session of the UN General Assembly. After this, intergovernmental processes will consider their recommendations.\n\nTo build a better world, stop chasing economic growth\n\nOther efforts include the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting and the UN System of National Accounts 2025 initiative, which are revising economic accounts to include more well-being components. The 2024 UN Pact for the Future and recommendations from the secretary-general’s Our Common Agenda report call for measures of progress that complement GDP. But these efforts need help from researchers and the consensus recommendations of the High-Level Expert Group.\n\nThe UN can also play a central part in strengthening institutional capacity and securing stable funding to support the regular production of national estimates. Advances in citizen science, social-media analytics and remote sensing offer opportunities to reduce costs and improve data reliability. The world is awash with big data, so directing even a fraction of these resources towards measuring sustainable and inclusive well-being would enhance global monitoring and policy effectiveness.\n\nDevelop dynamic models that go beyond GDP\n\nGDP has retained its dominance partly because it is embedded in the models that underpin national accounts and policy analyses. For example, the input–output model developed by economist Wassily Leontief6 tracks monetary flows across sectors and into ‘final demand’, defined as GDP.\n\nWhy we need to measure people’s well-being — lessons from a global survey\n\nMainstream macroeconomic models also place growth at the centre of policy evaluation. For example, standard computable general equilibrium models assume a high degree of substitutability among factors of production, implying that labour or technology can largely replace natural resources. They neglect environmental limits and exclude well-being, equity and ecological integrity. Most importantly, they are optimization models that are intended to maximize a single objective — GDP — rather than being designed to evaluate policies against multiple goals, as is required for sustainable and inclusive well-being.\n\nNew models are needed. These must be dynamic, nonlinear and represent the economy as a subsystem of society embedded in the biosphere. Such models must be able to compare resource use and pollution to environmental limits, and social outcomes to the thresholds required to meet human needs7. They must track both stocks (natural, human, social and built capital) and flows (including monetary transactions, ecosystem services and social benefits) and capture their interactions, including feedbacks from transgressing environmental limits. Ecological macroeconomic models, rooted in the field of ecological economics, are one promising approach8.",

      "title": "Green Roof Policies Are a Growing Trend: 2025 Update",
      "summary": "In 2009, the Canadian city of Toronto, Ontario, passed the first law in North America...\nThe post Green Roof Policies Are a Growing Trend: 2025 Update appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "In 2009, the Canadian city of Toronto, Ontario, passed the first law in North America requiring green roofs on newly constructed buildings over a certain size. Now, more than 15 years after Toronto’s Green Roof Bylaw was passed, the city has installed 640 new green roofs under the law.\n\nAnd the rest of North America is catching on. The number of green roofs on the continent is estimated to have grown significantly, with cities across the continent implementing increasingly stringent requirements.\n\nWhat Are Green Roofs?\n\nIt’s common to call anything that’s more sustainable than standard practices “green.” But a green roof, also called a living roof, is not just any sustainable roofing material; it is a roofing system that supports living plants. Green roofs have been around in the form of sod roofs since at least the Middle Ages.\n\nA modern green roof involves more than just plants. It needs high-quality waterproofing and protection against root damage, a drainage system, filter cloth, and a lightweight growing medium. The plants may be small, drought-tolerant ones like sedums, or larger grasses. The system can be modular or site-built, and depending on the planting medium depth, may even resemble a natural meadow or a garden with shrubs and trees.\n\nProject Drawdown ranks green roofs and cool roofs as #73 in their list of solutions to global warming, with an anticipated 0.77 gigaton reduction in carbon dioxide by 2050. If green roofs cover 30% of roof space by 2050 and cool roofs cover 60%, approximately 407 billion square feet of efficient roofing would be in place globally.\n\nBarriers to Adoption\n\nDespite growing support, several challenges continue to limit widespread implementation.\n\nHigh Costs: Initial installation costs remain a financial barrier. A University of Michigan study found that a 21,000-square-foot green roof costs about $100,000 more to install than a conventional roof. Maintenance costs and the need for specialized expertise add to these expenses.\n\nStructural Concerns: Existing buildings, especially older ones, may not have been designed to bear the additional weight of saturated soil and vegetation. Assessing and potentially reinforcing structural capacity adds complexity and cost.\n\nTechnical Challenges: The design and construction process requires coordination across multiple disciplines. Green roof components appear on architectural, structural, landscape, and plumbing drawings, while civil engineers handle exterior drainage—creating potential for coordination challenges.\n\nPolicy and Regulatory Gaps: In municipalities without green roof policies, the permitting process for a living roof can pose barriers. Complex approval timelines often mean stormwater management plans are submitted before green roof designs are finalized.\n\nLack of awareness of green roofs across the public and private sectors, insufficient promotion by government entities, and limited experience with green roof systems in some regions continue to slow adoption. More research is needed to confidently price the public and environmental benefits of green roofs, including their distributed energy savings and cooling effects on surrounding buildings.\n\nResearch Confirms Green Roof Benefits\n\nA 2024 study published in Nature Cities reports that Seoul’s city-wide green roof implementation could reduce building energy use intensity by up to 7.7%. Another comprehensive 2024 study in Nature Urban Sustainability projected that by 2100, green and cool roofs could reduce HVAC use by up to 71.72% in six cities studied. A 2023 meta-analysis found that green roofs reduce rooftop surface temperatures by an average of 30°C during summer months.\n\nA U.S. General Services Administration study that was removed from its website following the Trump Administration’s anti-green guidance estimated that the heating and cooling savings from green roofs on commercial and public buildings paid back the cost of installation in about 6.2 years.\n\nResidential and Commercial Applications\n\nGreen roofs on private residences are very efficient. Despite the high cost of design and installation, which has slowed their adoption as a standard roofing option, they can provide lifetime savings.\n\nSingle-family homes accounted for less than 2 percent of green roofs in the U.S. in 2015. Multifamily homes, on the other hand, provide economies of scale that can justify the expense (and sometimes have the square footage to trigger green roof requirements), accounting for 22 percent of green roof projects. That still leaves the vast majority of green roofs to industrial and commercial buildings.\n\nBut private homeowners need not despair. Many of the incentives for green roof construction are also available for single-family residences.\n\nSeveral impressive green roof installations have been completed in recent years:\n\nWill’s Garden at Carle Foundation Hospital is a 2023 Award of Excellence winner that features a therapeutic garden in Urbana, Illinois. The immersive, wheelchair-accessible rooftop included significant technical achievements that allow the plants to grow in only six inches of media.\n\nConstruction began on the LXK Office and Residential Campus in Berlin. A designed development, it includes green rooftops and terraces.\n\nKö-Bogen II, in Düsseldorf, Germany, is a commercial complex features one of Europe’s largest green façades with over 30,000 hornbeam plants that provide a “green heart” and “urban mountain” in the city.\n\nThe Vancouver Convention Centre’s six-acre living roof remains the largest in Canada.\n\nThe California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco features 1.7 million plants in its living roof.\n\nChicago City Hall’s green roof remains one of the most studied examples, with more than 20,000 plants from 150 species.\n\nCarrots and Sticks: Policy Approaches\n\nToronto became the first city to require green roofs in 2009; in 2019, New York City became one of the latest major cities to pass mandatory legislation. At least 25 cities in North America now have programs to encourage green roofs, with a trend toward making them mandatory rather than voluntary. The organization also developed the Living Architecture Performance Tool, a free rating system and best practice guide for policymakers.\n\nThese cities are taking the next step toward making green roofs a fixture in their skylines:\n\nPortland, Oregon (2020): The city’s “ecoroof” requirement went into effect, mandating that vegetation must cover 100% of roofs on buildings in the central city over 20,000 square feet (with some exceptions).\n\nDenver, Colorado: Denver’s green roof ordinance requires new construction and existing buildings over 25,000 square feet to dedicate portions of their rooftops to vegetation or solar panels. The percentage of vegetation required increases with building size: 20% for 25,000 sq ft buildings, up to 60% for buildings 200,000 sq ft or larger.\n\nSan Francisco: The city implemented the first green roof mandate in the United States in January 2017 with its “Better Roofs Ordinance,” requiring living roofs on most new construction as part of the Sustainable City initiative.\n\nNew York City: Through the Climate Mobilization Act, Local Laws 92 and 94, passed in 2019, require solar panels or green roofs on all new construction and buildings undertaking major roof renovations. Additionally, the city’s Resolution 66 tripled the tax break for property owners who install green roofs in high-priority areas.\n\nFinancial Incentives\n\nCities have also added financial incentive programs to the inherent benefits of green roofs. Check your community’s official website to discover whether financial assistance is available for green roof installation.\n\nFor example, New York City’s Green Roof Property Tax Abatement Program offers building owners $4.50 per square foot of green roof, or a maximum abatement of $100,000 per facility. The city’s Department of Environmental Protection Green Infrastructure Grant Program reimburses private building owners up to 100% of the cost of installing a green roof.\n\nChicago’s Sustainable Development Policy provides a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) bonus for developers who include green roofs, allowing them to construct more units on the same lot.\n\nMany municipalities are adding new stormwater fees in response to climate change. These regulations often include tax credits for green roof installation, which are calculated based on the area covered or the effectiveness in reducing runoff.\n\nGreen Roofs for Healthy Cities updated its policy guide in 2023 to provide essential information for professionals, policymakers, and advocates. The guide covers regulations, incentives, and approaches across North America.\n\nGreen Roofs Rising\n\nThe movement toward green roof policies continues to gain momentum. Organizations like Green Roofs for Healthy Cities offer training and accreditation programs, including the Green Roof Professional (GRP) and the Green Roof Installation and Maintenance Professional Certification (GRIMP), helping build expertise in the field.\n\nNew green roof policies are appearing all the time. The benefits—from reducing air conditioning needs by up to 75% to managing stormwater, improving air quality, and providing urban wildlife habitat—make them an increasingly attractive option for sustainable development.

Green roofs are special roofs covered with plants that help cool buildings and clean the air.\n\n**What happened** – Since then, more than 640 green roofs have been built in Toronto, and many other cities across North America have started making green roofs mandatory or offering financial help to encourage them. Cities like New York, San Francisco, Portland, and Denver have passed laws requiring green roofs on new or renovated buildings.\n\n**Impact** – Green roofs help lower the temperature of buildings by up to 30°C in summer and can reduce energy used for heating and cooling by as much as 70% in some places. They also absorb rainwater, reduce pollution, and provide homes for birds and insects. Studies show these roofs can cut carbon emissions significantly by 2050.\n\n**What's next step** – More cities are expected to create green roof policies and offer money to help cover the costs. Training programs are growing to teach people how to build and care for green roofs. This means green roofs will likely become common in city buildings, helping fight climate change and improve city life.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Green roofs are becoming a popular and effective way for North American cities to save energy, reduce pollution, and manage rainwater through smart building rules and support programs.",

      "title": "Recycling Mystery: Milk and Juice Cartons",
      "summary": "The process of recycling our paper and plastic materials is familiar to most of us....\nThe post Recycling Mystery: Milk and Juice Cartons appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "The process of recycling our paper and plastic materials is familiar to most of us. But what about their composite counterpart, the carton? Carton recycling infrastructure has expanded significantly in recent years, but many mixed plastic and paper cartons still don’t get recycled.\n\nAccording to The Recycling Partnership’s 2024 State of Recycling report, only 21% of residential recyclables overall are captured in the United States, with packaging materials representing a significant opportunity for improvement. Despite this broader challenge, access to carton recycling has grown substantially.\n\nToday, 61% of U.S. households can recycle food and beverage cartons through local programs—up from just 37% in 2011. In California, recent data shows that 72% of households have access to aseptic carton recycling, and 74% have access to gable-top carton recycling, reflecting significant infrastructure improvements in the state.\n\nThe United States is making real progress in this recycling category, however challenges remain. The carton recycling rate currently stands at approximately 20%, up from 6% in 2009, when the Carton Council formed.\n\nHere’s updated information to help demystify carton recycling in 2025.\n\nWhat Makes Up a Milk/Juice Carton?\n\nA type of packaging for food and beverage products, cartons are easy to recognize. They are available in two types—shelf-stable (or aseptic) and refrigerated (gable-top).\n\nShelf-stable cartons , as the name suggests, can be placed on store shelves and are used mostly for juice, milk, soy milk, soup, broth, and wine stored at room temperature.\n\nRefrigerated cartons are found in grocery stores’ refrigerated sections and contain products such as milk, juice, cream, and egg substitutes.\n\nCartons require fewer natural resources to transport due to their efficient product-to-packaging ratio. On average, a product sold in a shelf-stable carton is 94% product and 6% packaging. This means that fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced since products in cartons can be shipped using fewer trucks.\n\nPaper, plastic, and aluminum are layered together to make cartons: A typical shelf-stable carton averages about 70% paper, 25% plastic, and 5% aluminum. A familiar form of this packaging is unrefrigerated soup or wine cartons.\n\nRefrigerated cartons skip the aluminum and usually use an 80% paper and 20% plastic combination to hold the liquid. The Carton Council of Canada provides extensive information about the composition of different types of cartons and their recyclability.\n\nThere are other products that we commonly refer to as “cartons,” including ice cream cartons and take-out cartons. But from a recycling standpoint, these are not the same as shelf-stable and refrigerated carton types and are not included in the recyclable carton category.\n\nTop Responsible Carton Manufacturers\n\nYour role in recycling improvements starts in the store aisle. Take the time to look at the maker of a carton before buying. Search for companies that have joined the Carton Council recycling initiative: Tetra Pak, Elopak, SIG Combibloc, and Pactiv Evergreen (formerly Evergreen Packaging).\n\nWhy Should I Recycle Cartons?\n\nRecycling your cartons is a great way to keep unnecessary waste out of landfills, but your green contribution can start when you are shopping. Look for cartons that contain recycled materials. You will conserve energy by choosing a sustainable product package in the first place.\n\nThe high quality of the materials used in cartons makes them very desirable for remanufacturing into new products. All three materials used to make cartons can be reused. The challenge is separating those components during the recycling process. You can help by rinsing out the carton before putting it in your curbside program, if it is accepted (check whether your local hauler accepts paper/plastic cartons using your ZIP code).\n\nCarton manufacturers are committed to increasing access to carton recycling in the United States, avoiding landfill disposal, and ensuring that the materials used to make cartons are reused once the product they contain is gone. There is growing demand for recycled fiber. According to recent data, U.S. mills consumed 32.7 million tons of recycled paper in 2024, up from 31.3 million tons in 2023.\n\nCommon Misconceptions About Cartons\n\nCartons are not recyclable: False\n\nCartons are recyclable. Made mostly from paper, cartons are in high demand to be made into new products. Manufacturers of cartons have joined forces in the Carton Council to increase access to carton recycling across the United States. As of 2025, carton recycling is now available to over 77 million U.S. households—a nearly 240% increase since 2009.\n\nThe Carton Council worked with key players in the recycling industry, from recycling facilities to paper mills, to ensure that cartons are handled properly at recycling facilities. There are now thousands of carton recycling programs nationwide, with access continuing to expand.\n\nI can’t recycle cartons because they don’t have a symbol on them: False\n\nTo qualify for the recycling symbol, the product must be recyclable, and recycling of that product must be available to the majority of U.S. households. The Federal Trade Commission regulates this process. While cartons are making progress toward placing the recycling symbol on packages, many cartons still do not feature it.\n\nCheck whether you can recycle cartons locally by visiting the Carton Council or the Earth911 Recycling Search .\n\nCartons are wax-coated: False\n\nCartons do not contain any wax and have not for many years. Modern cartons are made mainly from paper. Gable-top (or refrigerated) cartons contain additional layers of plastic. In contrast, aseptic (or shelf-stable) cartons contain additional layers of plastic and aluminum.\n\nCartons are designed to keep the product as fresh as possible, blocking out light and air that can cause spoilage.\n\nA cool fact about cartons: The colorful labeling on the outside is printed on the thin plastic layer. When recycled, removing that layer leaves behind valuable paper fibers that are used to make new paper products.\n\nHow Does Carton Recycling Work?\n\nWhat happens to that carton after it’s picked up from your recycling bin? Typically, its journey begins at a materials recovery facility (MRF) where it gets separated from other waste and types of recyclables.\n\nFrom there, cartons take one of two paths:\n\nPath 1: Paper Mills\n\nWhen cartons reach a paper mill, they’re prized for their long, strong fibers. Jason Pelz, VP of Sustainability for Tetra Pak, told WasteDive that fiber quality makes cartons a dependable part of a mill’s feedstock mix.\n\nThey are mixed with water in a giant blender called a hydra-pulper that separates the paper from the plastic and aluminum. Once separation is complete, the paper fiber is ready to be used in new products, including tissues, office paper, paper towels.\n\nPlastic and aluminum are also collected from the hydropulping process. In North America, it is usually left in a combined state with the aluminum, creating a material called a poly/al mix. The poly/al mix has a limited secondary-use market, but some mills have burned it to generate energy for their facilities while others sell it to specialized recyclers who turn it into pallets, crates, furniture, and tiles.\n\nPath 2: Building Materials Manufacturing\n\nA rapidly expanding option for carton recycling transforms whole cartons into durable building materials. Rather than pulping cartons for their fiber, some facilities are converting them into roof cover boards and construction materials.\n\nCartons are shredded into small pieces and then pressed under heat to form large sheets. The heat melts the polymers in the cartons, binding everything together without added chemicals or water, to produce finished boards, typically 4×8 feet, are strong, that are moisture-resistant and suitable for a variety of building applications.\n\nU.S. Carton Recycling Facilities\n\nThe infrastructure for carton recycling continues to expand across the United States. Shortening the distance between points of collection and processing is important to making the recycling system more sustainable than today’s take-make-waste approach to pakcaging. Here are some of the key facilities:\n\nBuilding Materials Facilities\n\nReCB Iowa LLC – Des Moines, Iowa-based ReCB Iowa reopened in August 2025 after acquiring and upgrading the former Continuus Materials facility. This facility produces Everboard™, a high-performance roof cover board made from post-consumer food and beverage cartons. The facility has the capacity to recycle approximately 10,000 tons of cartons annually.\n\nReCB California LLC in Lodi, California, is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025, this new facility will process roughly 750 tons of food and beverage cartons each month, adding West Coast capacity for carton recycling that will produce the same Everboard™ building materials. ReCB plans to open up to five additional facilities across the country in the coming years.\n\nPaper Mills\n\nNumerous paper mills across the United States accept cartons as part of their recovered fiber feedstock. More than 40 Major paper mills accept polycoated paper products, including cartons, representing significant growth in end-market capacity over the past few years:\n\nPratt Industries operates six 100% recycled paper mills across the United States, including facilities in Henderson, Kentucky, and Wapakoneta, Ohio. Pratt recovers more than 3 million tons of recyclable material annually.\n\nInternational Paper operates recycling facilities nationwide that collect, sort, and process 7 million tons of recovered paper annually.\n\nGreif operates multiple mills, including facilities in Delaware and Ohio, that produce 1.5 million tons of paperboard annually, with more than 95% recycled content.\n\nSonoco, WestRock, Carotell Paperboard, and KapStone operate mills in South Carolina and other locations that consume over 1.2 million tons of old corrugated cardboard and other recovered fiber annually.\n\nBranded Collection Programs and Support\n\nCarton Council Programs\n\nThe Carton Council of North America offers several programs to expand carton recycling:\n\nSchool Grant Program The Carton Council provides grants of up to $5,000 to U.S. and Canadian K-12 schools to for recycling programs. Only 10% of U.S. primary and secondary schools currently recycle cartons.\n\nGrant funds can be used to purchase collection bins, create educational materials and signage, or support other activities that promote school carton recycling.\n\nMunicipal and MRF Support: Tetra Pak and the Carton Council also offer grants, resources, and technical support to help municipalities and MRFs expand carton collection and sorting capacity. The grants can be used for equipment upgrades, optimizing sorting processes, and establishing connections between sellers and buyers of recycled carton bales.\n\nExtended Producer Responsibility (EPR)\n\nCalifornia’s packaging EPR program (SB 54) is driving significant investments in carton recycling infrastructure. The state now has 23 counties served by MRFs that accept and sort cartons—an increase of seven counties since April 2025. California’s “Truth in Recycling” law (SB 343) also requires that products can be labeled recyclable only if they meet certain recycling thresholds, providing an additional incentive for infrastructure development.\n\nMail-In and Drop-Off Options\n\nWhile curbside collection is the most-used method for carton recycling where available, some areas may have limited access. For residents without curbside carton recycling:\n\nCheck for local drop-off locations using the Carton Council’s locator tool or the Earth911 Recycling Search . Contact your local MRF directly to ask if they accept cartons. Some MRFs accept cartons even if they’re not listed in curbside programs, particularly if they serve specific haulers like Republic Services or Rumpke Waste & Recycling. Advocate for carton recycling in your community by contacting your local waste management provider or municipality to request that cartons be added to the list of accepted materials.\n\nWhat Do I Need to Know About Recycling Cartons?\n\nAlways check with your local recycling or waste-disposal service for guidelines in your community. Curbside pickup is gaining popularity, but is still not available everywhere. Use the Carton Council locator or contact your hauler directly.\n\nRemove any lids, straws, or extras that come with your packaging. These should go in the garbage.\n\nRecycle only empty cartons. Rinsing isn’t required before recycling, but it does help ensure that the container is empty an reduces potential odor or pest issues in the recyclables.\n\nIt is not necessary to flatten your cartons , and, in fact, it can slow the recycling process. MRF sorting equipment is programmed to recognize a carton’s three-dimensional shape.\n\nWhen in doubt, keep it out. This rule of thumb is essential for all recycling practices. Rather than risk contaminating your local recycling stream, keep materials that you aren’t sure about out of your recycling.\n\nThe EPA estimates that expanding recycling access and infrastructure could result in recycling an additional 38 million to 45 million tons of packaging material annually.\n\nWith new facilities opening, expanding paper mill acceptance, growing municipal programs, and new end markets for recycled carton material developing, the infrastructure is making progress toward matching consumer expectations. The Carton Council and its member companies continue working toward a future where carton recycling is as commonplace as recycling paper and cardboard.\n\nEditor’s note: Originally published on November 20, 2015, this article was updated in November 2018 and most recently revised in November 2025 with current statistics, facility information, and program details.",
