      "title": "Astronomers discover one of the Universe’s largest spinning structures",
      "summary": "Scientists have discovered a giant cosmic filament where galaxies spin in sync with the structure that holds them together. The razor-thin chain of galaxies sits inside a much larger filament that appears to be slowly rotating as a whole. This coordinated motion is far stronger than expected by chance and hints that galaxy spin may be inherited from the cosmic web itself. The finding opens a new window into how galaxies formed and how matter flows across the Universe.",
      "content": "An international research team led by the University of Oxford has identified one of the largest rotating structures ever observed. The object is a razor thin chain of galaxies embedded within a vast cosmic filament located about 140 million light years from Earth. The results were published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and may provide important clues about how galaxies formed in the early Universe.\n\nCosmic filaments are the biggest known structures in the Universe. They are enormous thread like networks of galaxies and dark matter that create the framework of the cosmic web. These filaments also act as pathways that funnel matter and angular momentum into galaxies. Nearby filaments where many galaxies spin in the same direction, and where the entire structure itself appears to rotate, are especially valuable for studying how galaxies acquired their spin and gas. They also offer a way to test ideas about how rotation develops across tens of millions of light years.\n\nA Razor Thin Line of Gas Rich Galaxies\n\nIn this study, researchers identified 14 nearby galaxies rich in hydrogen gas arranged in a narrow, elongated line measuring about 5.5 million light years in length and roughly 117,000 light years across. This thin structure lies within a much larger cosmic filament that stretches about 50 million light years and contains more than 280 additional galaxies. Many of the galaxies in the thin strand appear to be rotating in the same direction as the filament itself, far more often than would be expected if their orientations were random. This finding challenges existing models and suggests that large scale cosmic structures may shape galaxy rotation more strongly or over longer periods than previously believed.\n\nThe team also found that galaxies on opposite sides of the filament's central spine are moving in opposite directions. This pattern indicates that the entire filament is rotating as a single structure. By applying models of filament dynamics, the researchers estimated a rotation speed of about 110 km/s and calculated that the dense central region of the filament has a radius of approximately 50 kiloparsecs (about 163,000 light years).\n\nGalaxies Like Teacups on a Spinning Ride\n\nCo lead author Dr. Lyla Jung (Department of Physics, University of Oxford) explained why the discovery stands out: \"What makes this structure exceptional is not just its size, but the combination of spin alignment and rotational motion. You can liken it to the teacups ride at a theme park. Each galaxy is like a spinning teacup, but the whole platform- the cosmic filament -is rotating too. This dual motion gives us rare insight into how galaxies gain their spin from the larger structures they live in.\"\n\nThe filament appears to be relatively young and largely undisturbed. Its abundance of gas rich galaxies and its low internal motion, described as a so called \"dynamically cold\" state, suggest it is still in an early stage of development. Because hydrogen is the key ingredient for forming new stars, galaxies with large hydrogen reserves are actively collecting or holding onto the fuel needed for star formation. Studying these systems offers a valuable view into early or ongoing phases of galaxy evolution.\n\nTracing Gas Flows Through the Cosmic Web\n\nHydrogen rich galaxies also serve as effective tracers of how gas moves along cosmic filaments. Atomic hydrogen is easily influenced by motion, making it especially useful for revealing how gas flows through filaments and into galaxies. These observations help scientists understand how angular momentum moves through the cosmic web and shapes galaxy structure, rotation, and star formation.\n\nThe discovery may also help refine models of intrinsic galaxy alignments, which can interfere with measurements in upcoming weak lensing surveys. These include missions such as the European Space Agency's Euclid spacecraft and observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.\n\nCo lead author Dr. Madalina Tudorache (Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge / Department of Physics, University of Oxford) said: \"This filament is a fossil record of cosmic flows. It helps us piece together how galaxies acquire their spin and grow over time.\"\n\nCombining Powerful Telescopes and Surveys\n\nThe research team used data from South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope, one of the most powerful radio observatories in the world, made up of 64 interconnected dishes. The spinning filament was identified through a deep sky survey known as MIGHTEE, led by Professor of Astrophysics Matt Jarvis (Department of Physics, University of Oxford). The radio data were combined with optical observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), revealing a cosmic filament that shows both coordinated galaxy spin and large scale rotation.\n\nProfessor Jarvis said: \"This really demonstrates the power of combining data from different observatories to obtain greater insights into how large structures and galaxies form in the Universe. Such studies can only be achieved by large groups with diverse skillsets, and in this case, it was really made possible by winning an ERC Advanced Grant/UKIR Frontiers Research Grant, which funded the co-lead authors.\"\n\nThe study also included researchers from University of Cambridge, University of the Western Cape, Rhodes University, South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, University of Hertfordshire, University of Bristol, University of Edinburgh, and University of Cape Town.",

      "title": "What are asteroids really made of? New analysis brings space mining closer to reality",
      "summary": "Scientists are digging into the hidden makeup of carbon-rich asteroids to see whether they could one day fuel space exploration—or even be mined for valuable resources. By analyzing rare meteorites that naturally fall to Earth, researchers have uncovered clues about the chemistry, history, and potential usefulness of these ancient space rocks. While large-scale asteroid mining is still far off, the study highlights specific asteroid types that may be promising targets, especially for water extraction.",
      "content": "Scientists still have much to learn about what small asteroids are made of. These rocky bodies may contain valuable metals, ancient material left over from the formation of the solar system, and chemical clues that reveal the history of their original parent bodies. Because of this, they are increasingly viewed as possible sources of future space resources.\n\nA research team led by the Institute of Space Sciences (ICE-CSIC) examined samples linked to C-type asteroids, carbon rich objects that are believed to be the original sources of carbonaceous chondrites. Their results, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, strengthen the case that these asteroids could serve as important material reservoirs. The findings also help scientists identify where these meteorites came from and support planning for future space missions and resource extraction technologies.\n\nRare Meteorites From Ancient Asteroids\n\nCarbonaceous chondrites arrive on Earth naturally, but they account for only about 5% of all meteorite falls. Many are extremely fragile and break apart before they can be recovered, which makes them especially rare. When they are found, it is often in desert environments such as the Sahara or Antarctica, where preservation conditions are favorable.\n\n\"The scientific interest in each of these meteorites is that they sample small, undifferentiated asteroids, and provide valuable information on the chemical composition and evolutionary history of the bodies from which they originate,\" says Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez, the study's lead author and an astrophysicist at ICE-CSIC, affiliated to the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia (IEEC).\n\nMeasuring the Building Blocks of Asteroids\n\nTo carry out the study, the ICE-CSIC team selected and carefully characterized asteroid related samples before sending them for detailed chemical analysis. The measurements were performed using mass spectrometry at the University of Castilla-La Mancha by Professor Jacinto Alonso-Azcárate. This work allowed the researchers to determine the precise chemical makeup of the six most common types of carbonaceous chondrites and assess whether extracting materials from their parent asteroids could one day be practical.\n\nThe Asteroids, Comets, and Meteorites research group at ICE-CSIC has spent more than a decade studying the physical and chemical properties of asteroid and comet surfaces. \"At ICE-CSIC and IEEC, we specialize in developing experiments to better understand the properties of these asteroids and how the physical processes that occur in space affect their nature and mineralogy,\" Trigo-Rodríguez explains.\n\nHe also notes that ICE-CSIC serves as the international repository for NASA's Antarctic meteorite collection. Over the past ten years, he has helped select and request several of the carbonaceous chondrites used in this study and has designed multiple experiments around them. \"The work now being published is the culmination of that team effort,\" he says.\n\nAre Asteroid Resources Worth Extracting?\n\n\"Studying and selecting these types of meteorites in our clean room using other analytical techniques is fascinating, particularly because of the diversity of minerals and chemical elements they contain. However, most asteroids have relatively small abundances of precious elements, and therefore the objective of our study has been to understand to what extent their extraction would be viable,\" says Pau Grèbol Tomás, a predoctoral researcher at ICE-CSIC.\n\nJordi Ibáñez-Insa, a co-author of the study and researcher at Geosciences Barcelona (GEO3BCN-CSIC), points out that while many small asteroids are covered in loose surface material known as regolith, collecting small samples is very different from extracting resources at scale. \"Although most small asteroids have surfaces covered in fragmented material called regolith -and it would facilitate the return of small amounts of samples-, developing large-scale collection systems to achieve clear benefits is a very different matter. In any case, it deserves to be explored because the search for resources in space could be susceptible to minimizing the impact of mining activities on terrestrial ecosystems,\" he says.\n\nChoosing the Right Asteroids for the Future\n\nThe main asteroid belt contains an enormous range of objects, and understanding what resources they hold requires careful classification. According to Trigo-Rodríguez, asteroid composition varies widely due to their long and complex histories. \"They are small and quite heterogeneous objects, heavily influenced by their evolutionary history, particularly collisions and close approaches to the Sun. If we are looking for water, there are certain asteroids from which hydrated carbonaceous chondrites originate, which, conversely, will have fewer metals in their native state. Let's not forget that, after 4.56 billion years since their formation, each asteroid has a different composition, as revealed by the study of chondritic meteorites.\"\n\nOne key conclusion of the research is that mining undifferentiated asteroids -- the primordial remnants of the solar system's formation considered the progenitor bodies of chondritic meteorites -- remains impractical for now. However, the team identifies a different class of relatively pristine asteroids that display olivine and spinel signatures as more promising mining targets.\n\nTo confidently identify such candidates, the researchers emphasize the importance of detailed chemical studies of carbonaceous chondrites combined with new sample return missions. These missions would help confirm which asteroids are truly linked to the meteorites studied on Earth.\n\nTechnology, Water, and Long Term Exploration\n\n\"Alongside the progress represented by sample return missions, companies capable of taking decisive steps in the technological development necessary to extract and collect these materials under low-gravity conditions are truly needed. The processing of these materials and the waste generated would also have a significant impact that should be quantified and properly mitigated,\" Trigo-Rodríguez adds.\n\nThe team expects progress in the near future, especially as in situ resource use becomes increasingly important for long duration missions to the Moon and Mars. Using materials found in space could significantly reduce the need for supplies launched from Earth. If water is the primary target, the researchers stress that asteroids altered by water and rich in water bearing minerals should be prioritized.\n\nExtracting resources in low gravity environments will require entirely new approaches. \"It sounds like science fiction, but it also seemed like science fiction when the first sample return missions were being planned thirty years ago,\" says Pau Grèbol Tomàs.\n\nFrom Planetary Defense to Space Resources\n\nGlobally, several concepts are already being discussed, including capturing small asteroids that pass close to Earth and placing them into circumlunar orbit for study and resource use. Trigo-Rodríguez highlights that water rich carbonaceous asteroids may be especially attractive targets. \"For certain water-rich carbonaceous asteroids, extracting water for reuse seems more viable, either as fuel or as a primary resource for exploring other worlds. This could also provide science with greater knowledge about certain bodies that could one day threaten our very existence. In the long term, we could even mine and shrink potentially hazardous asteroids so that they cease to be dangerous,\" he explains.",
