      "title": "Breakthrough blood test finally confirms Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "summary": "A team of scientists has developed a highly accurate blood test for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The test reads tiny DNA patterns that reveal the biological signature of the illness. For millions who’ve faced doubt and misdiagnosis, it’s a breakthrough that finally validates their experience — and may help diagnose long Covid too.",
      "content": "Scientists from the University of East Anglia and Oxford BioDynamics have created a highly accurate blood test capable of diagnosing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS).\n\nThe condition, which causes long-term and often debilitating exhaustion, affects millions of people around the world, including more than 400,000 individuals in the UK. Despite its prevalence, ME/CFS has remained poorly understood and notoriously difficult to diagnose.\n\nThis new test, which demonstrates 96 percent accuracy, offers renewed hope to patients who have struggled for recognition and reliable answers. Researchers believe the discovery could also lead to a similar test for identifying long Covid.\n\nValidating an Illness Long Dismissed\n\nLead researcher Prof Dmitry Pshezhetskiy of UEA's Norwich Medical School explained, \"ME/CFS is a serious and often disabling illness characterized by extreme fatigue that is not relieved by rest.\n\n\"We know that some patients report being ignored or even told that their illness is 'all in their head'. With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.\n\n\"We wanted to see if we could develop a blood test to diagnose the condition -- and we did!\n\n\"Our discovery offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management.\"\n\n\"Post-Covid syndrome, commonly referred to as long Covid, is one example of ME/CFS, where a similar cluster of symptoms is triggered by the Covid-19 virus, rather than by other known causes such as glandular fever. We therefore hope that our research will also help pave the way for a similar test to accurately diagnose long Covid.\"\n\nUsing DNA Folding to Detect Disease\n\nTo develop the test, researchers employed Oxford BioDynamics' advanced EpiSwitch® 3D Genomics technology, which examines how DNA is folded within cells. The study analyzed blood samples from 47 people with severe ME/CFS and compared them to 61 healthy volunteers.\n\nEach human cell contains around two metres of DNA, intricately folded in three dimensions. These folds are not random; they form deliberate patterns that help control how genes are activated or silenced, keeping the body functioning properly.\n\nAlexandre Akoulitchev, Chief Scientific Officer at Oxford BioDynamics, said, \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is not a genetic disease you're born with. That's why using EpiSwitch 'epigenetic' markers -- which can change during a person's life, unlike fixed genetic code -- was key to reaching this high level of accuracy.\n\n\"The EpiSwitch platform behind this test, together with OBD's vast 3D Genomic knowledgebase, has already been proven to deliver practical, rapid blood diagnostics accessible at scale.\n\n\"With this breakthrough, we are proud to enable a first-in-class test that can address an unmet need for a quick and reliable diagnostic for a complex, challenging-to-identify illness.\"\n\nProven Technology Behind the Discovery\n\nEpiSwitch technology has previously helped identify blood-based biomarkers for other complex conditions, including fast-progressing ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), rheumatoid arthritis, and several cancers. It also underpins the EpiSwitch PSE prostate cancer test, which delivers world-leading accuracy and is already in clinical use across the UK and US.\n\nIn the ME/CFS study, researchers found a distinctive genomic pattern present only in affected individuals and absent in healthy participants. This work looked beyond the linear DNA sequence explored in the large DecodeME study, which was the most extensive genetic investigation of ME/CFS to date.[1]\n\nBy examining the 3D architecture of DNA, the UEA and Oxford BioDynamics team uncovered hundreds of additional biological differences, including five of the eight genetic regions previously identified by DecodeME. This deeper insight could advance scientific understanding of the illness.\n\nUncovering Biological Clues for Future Treatments\n\nThe new analysis demonstrated exceptional precision, achieving 92 percent sensitivity (correctly identifying those with ME/CFS) and 98 percent specificity (correctly identifying those without it).\n\nResearchers also observed signs of immune system involvement and inflammation pathways, suggesting potential biological targets for future therapies. These findings may help determine which patients are most likely to benefit from specific treatments.\n\nToward More Accurate Diagnosis and Personalized Care\n\n\"This is a significant step forward,\" said UEA's Prof Pshezhetskiy. \"For the first time, we have a simple blood test that can reliably identify ME/CFS -- potentially transforming how we diagnose and manage this complex disease.\"\n\n\"Additionally, understanding the biological pathways involved in ME/CFS opens the door to developing targeted treatments and identifying which patients might benefit most from specific therapies.\n\n\"We hope that the Episwitch® CFS test could become a vital tool in clinical settings, paving the way for more personalized and effective care.\"\n\nNotes\n\nGenetics Discovery Team, et al (2025).

      "summary": "Scientists have discovered that a “longevity gene” found in people who live beyond 100 can reverse heart aging in models of Progeria, a devastating disease that causes children to age rapidly. By introducing this supercentenarian gene into Progeria-affected cells and mice, researchers restored heart function, reduced tissue damage, and slowed aging symptoms. The discovery opens the door to new therapies inspired by the natural biology of long-lived humans—possibly reshaping how we treat both rare diseases and normal aging.",
      "content": "Scientists have uncovered a breakthrough in the fight against a rare genetic condition that causes children to age much faster than normal. The discovery involves \"longevity genes\" found in people who live exceptionally long lives, often beyond 100 years. Researchers from the University of Bristol and IRCCS MultiMedica found that these genes, which help maintain the health of the heart and blood vessels during aging, could reverse some of the damage caused by this devastating disease.\n\nThe study, published in Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, is the first to show that a gene from long-lived individuals can slow down heart aging in a model of Progeria. Known scientifically as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), this rare and fatal disorder causes children to exhibit signs of \"accelerated aging.\"\n\nProgeria stems from a mutation in the LMNA gene, which leads to the creation of a harmful protein called progerin. This protein disrupts normal cell function, particularly in the heart and blood vessels. Most affected children die in their teenage years from heart complications, though some, like Sammy Basso -- the oldest known person with Progeria -- live longer. Sammy passed away on October 24, 2024, at the age of 28.\n\nProgerin harms cells by destabilizing their nucleus, the \"control center\" that manages cell activity. This damage accelerates aging, especially in the cardiovascular system.\n\nAt present, the only drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is lonafarnib, which reduces the accumulation of progerin. Researchers are now testing a combination of lonafarnib with another experimental drug, Progerinin, to determine whether the two work better together.\n\nTesting Longevity Genes from Supercentenarians\n\nTo explore new treatments, Dr. Yan Qiu and Professor Paolo Madeddu of the Bristol Heart Institute collaborated with Professor Annibale Puca's team at IRCCS MultiMedica in Italy. Their goal was to determine if genes from people who live to extreme old age -- supercentenarians -- could protect against the cellular damage caused by Progeria.\n\nThe scientists focused on one particular gene, LAV-BPIFB4, which previous research has shown supports healthy heart and blood vessel function during aging.\n\nUsing genetically engineered mice that develop Progeria, the researchers observed early heart problems similar to those found in children with the disease. After a single injection of the LAV-BPIFB4 longevity gene, the mice showed improved heart function, particularly in the way the heart relaxes and fills with blood (a process known as diastolic function).\n\nThe gene treatment also reduced heart tissue damage, known as fibrosis, and lowered the number of \"aged\" cells in the heart. In addition, it promoted the growth of new small blood vessels, potentially improving heart health and resilience.\n\nThe team then tested the gene on human cells derived from Progeria patients. These experiments revealed that introducing the longevity gene reduced cellular aging and fibrosis without altering progerin levels directly. This suggests that the gene helps cells withstand the toxic effects of progerin rather than eliminating it. The approach strengthens the body's natural defenses instead of attacking the defective protein itself.\n\nA New Approach to Treating Progeria and Heart Aging\n\nDr. Yan Qiu, Honorary Research Fellow in the Bristol Heart Institute at the University of Bristol, said: \"Our research has identified a protective effect of a \"supercentenarian longevity gene\" against progeria heart dysfunction in both animal and cell models.\n\n\"The results offer hope to a new type of therapy for Progeria; one based on the natural biology of healthy aging rather than blocking the faulty protein. This approach, in time, could also help fight normal age-related heart disease.\n\n\"Our research brings new hope in the fight against Progeria and suggests the genetics of supercentenarians could lead to new treatments for premature or accelerated cardiac aging, which might help us all live longer, healthier lives.\"\n\nLooking Ahead: Toward New Anti-Aging Therapies\n\nProfessor Annibale Puca, Research Group Leader at IRCCS MultiMedica and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Salerno, added: \"This is the first study to indicate that a longevity-associated gene can counteract the cardiovascular damage caused by progeria.\n\n\"The results pave the way for new treatment strategies for this rare disease, which urgently requires innovative cardiovascular drugs capable of improving both long-term survival and patient quality of life. Looking ahead, the administration of the LAV-BPIFB4 gene through gene therapy could be replaced and/or complemented by new protein- or RNA-based delivery methods.\n\n\"We are currently conducting numerous studies to investigate the potential of LAV-BPIFB4 in counteracting the deterioration of the cardiovascular and immune systems in various pathological conditions, with the goal of translating these experimental findings into a new biologic drug.\"",

      "summary": "UC San Diego researchers combined artificial intelligence with molecular biology to unravel how immune cells in the gut decide between inflammation and healing, a process gone awry in Crohn’s disease. They discovered that the NOD2 gene’s interaction with a protein called girdin is crucial for maintaining balance. When this connection is lost due to a common mutation, inflammation spirals out of control.",
      "content": "The human digestive system relies on two main kinds of macrophages, a type of specialized white blood cell, to maintain intestinal health. One group, the inflammatory macrophages, attacks harmful microbes, while the other, the non-inflammatory macrophages, repairs tissue and promotes healing. In Crohn's disease (a chronic form of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD), this balance breaks down. When the inflammatory type dominates, the result is persistent inflammation that damages the intestinal wall and causes pain and other symptoms.\n\nScientists at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine have created a new method that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with cutting-edge molecular biology tools to uncover what determines whether a macrophage becomes inflammatory or restorative.\n\nTheir research also sheds light on a mystery that has puzzled scientists for decades: how a gene known as NOD2 influences this process. Discovered in 2001, NOD2 was the first gene linked to an increased risk of Crohn's disease.\n\nMapping the Gut's Genetic Blueprint\n\nUsing advanced machine learning, the team examined thousands of macrophage gene expression profiles taken from both healthy colon tissue and tissue affected by IBD. This analysis revealed a genetic signature made up of 53 genes that consistently distinguished between aggressive, inflammatory macrophages and those responsible for repairing tissue.\n\nAmong these 53 genes, one encodes a protein called girdin. The researchers discovered that in non-inflammatory macrophages, a particular part of the NOD2 protein attaches to girdin. This interaction helps keep inflammation under control, removes harmful bacteria, and allows tissue to heal. However, the most common Crohn's disease mutation in the NOD2 gene deletes the section where girdin normally binds. Without that connection, the system becomes unbalanced, tipping toward chronic inflammation.\n\n\"NOD2 functions as the body's infection surveillance system,\" said senior author Pradipta Ghosh, M.D., professor of cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. \"When bound to girdin, it detects invading pathogens and maintains gut immune balance by swiftly neutralizing them. Without this partnership, the NOD2 surveillance system collapses.\"\n\nTesting the Discovery in Animal Models\n\nTo confirm their findings, the scientists compared mouse models of Crohn's disease that lacked the girdin protein with those that still had it. The mice missing girdin developed severe gut inflammation and an altered microbiome, and many died from sepsis, a dangerous condition caused by an uncontrolled immune response that inflames the entire body and harms vital organs.\n\n\"The gut is a battlefield, and macrophages are the peacekeepers,\" said co-first author Gajanan D. Katkar, Ph.D., assistant project scientist at UC San Diego School of Medicine. \"For the first time, AI has allowed us to clearly define and track the players on two opposing teams.\"\n\nToward New Treatments for Crohn's Disease\n\nBy merging AI-based analysis, biochemical research, and animal experiments, the study resolves one of the longest-standing questions in Crohn's disease research. The findings explain how a crucial genetic mutation drives inflammation and could guide the development of new therapies aimed at restoring the lost partnership between girdin and NOD2.\n\nThe study was published on October 2 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.",

      "summary": "Duke-NUS scientists unveiled BrainSTEM, a revolutionary single-cell map that captures the full cellular diversity of the developing human brain. The project’s focus on dopamine neurons provides crucial insight for Parkinson’s treatment. Their findings reveal flaws in current lab-grown models while offering a precise, open-source standard for future research. It’s a leap toward more accurate brain modeling and powerful cell-based therapies.",
      "content": "Scientists at Duke-NUS Medical School and partner institutions assembled one of the most complete single-cell maps of the developing human brain. The atlas identifies nearly every cell type, records their genetic signatures, and shows how these cells grow and interact. It also compares leading laboratory methods for producing high-quality neurons, advancing efforts to develop new therapies for Parkinson's disease and other brain disorders.\n\nParkinson's disease is Singapore's second most common neurodegenerative condition, affecting about three in every 1,000 people aged 50 and above. The disorder harms midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which release dopamine to regulate movement and learning. Restoring these neurons could eventually ease symptoms such as tremors and difficulty with mobility.\n\nTo clarify how dopaminergic neurons form in laboratory settings, the team created a two-step mapping approach called BrainSTEM (Brain Single-cell Two tiEr Mapping). In collaboration with partners including the University of Sydney, they profiled nearly 680,000 cells from the fetal brain to chart the full cellular landscape.\n\nA second, higher-resolution projection targets the midbrain with added precision and pinpoints dopaminergic neurons. This \"comprehensive reference map\" now serves as a global standard for evaluating how accurately midbrain models match real human biology.\n\nDr. Hilary Toh, an MD-PhD candidate from the Neuroscience & Behavioural Disorders program at Duke-NUS Medical School and one of the first authors of the paper, said:\n\n\"Our data-driven blueprint helps scientists produce high-yield midbrain dopaminergic neurons that faithfully reflect human biology. Grafts of this quality are pivotal to increasing cell therapy efficacy and minimizing side effects, paving the way to offer alternative therapies to people living with Parkinson's disease.\"\n\nPublished in Science Advances, the study reports that several methods used to grow midbrain cells also generated unwanted cells originating from other brain regions. These findings indicate that both experimental protocols and data analysis pipelines need refining to detect and remove such off-target populations.\n\nDr. John Ouyang, Principal Research Scientist from Duke-NUS' Centre for Computational Biology and a senior author of the study, said:\n\n\"By mapping the brain at single-cell resolution, BrainSTEM gives us the precision to distinguish even subtle off-target cell populations. This rich cellular detail provides a critical foundation for AI-driven models that will transform how we group patients and design targeted therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\nAssistant Professor Alfred Sun from Duke-NUS' Neuroscience & Behavioural Disorders programme, who's also a senior author of the paper, added:\n\n\"BrainSTEM marks a significant step forward in brain modelling. By delivering a rigorous, data-driven approach, it will speed the development of reliable cell therapies for Parkinson's disease. We're setting a new standard to ensure the next generation of Parkinson's models truly reflects human biology.\"\n\nThe researchers will release their brain atlases as open-source references and provide the multi-tier mapping approach as an out-of-the-box package. Because BrainSTEM can be applied to isolate any cell type in the brain, labs worldwide can use it to deepen insight, streamline workflows, and accelerate discovery across neuroscience.\n\nProfessor Patrick Tan, Senior Vice-Dean for Research at Duke-NUS, said:\n\n\"This study redefines the benchmark -- establishing multi-tier mapping as essential for capturing cellular detail in complex biological systems. By revealing how the human midbrain develops in such detail, we will accelerate Parkinson's research and cell therapy, delivering better care and offer hope to people living with the disease.\"\n\nThis work received support from programs including the USyd-NUS Ignition Grant and the Duke-NUS Parkinson's Research Fund through a generous donation by The Ida C. Morris Falk Foundation.\n\nDuke-NUS remains a leader in medical research and education, committed to improving patient care through scientific innovation. The study advances ongoing efforts to understand fundamental brain mechanisms and to develop new therapeutic strategies for neurological conditions.",
