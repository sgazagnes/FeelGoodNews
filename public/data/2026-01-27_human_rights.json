      "content": "NI to become first in the UK to introduce graduated driving licences\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Julie McCullough BBC News NI Share Save\n\nGetty Images The new rules are aimed at 17 to 23-year-olds and will change how people learn to drive\n\nNorthern Ireland will become the first area of the UK to bring in graduated driver licensing for learner drivers in a bid to reduce the amount of fatal road crashes involving young people, it has been announced. The reforms, described as the most significant changes to licencing in 70 years, will see Northern Ireland adopt a version of laws in place in countries including Australia, the US and the Republic of Ireland. The rules, due to be introduced in October, are aimed at 17 to 23-year-olds and will change how people learn to drive. They include a six-month wait for learner drivers before taking a practical test, as well as restrictions on night-time driving and passenger numbers.\n\nInfrastructure Minister Liz Kimmins said the changes were \"aimed at young drivers who are sadly most likely to be killed or seriously injured on our roads\". A senior Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officer, Ch Supt Sam Donaldson, said the scheme would save lives on the roads. Some young people who spoke to BBC News NI gave a mixed reaction to the reforms, with one saying they were \"not looking forward to the changes\".\n\nJames,15, says he is a bit \"shocked\" that he will have to wait six months before taking his driving test\n\nWhy is graduated driver licensing coming into NI?\n\nThe Department for Infrastructure said graduated driving licences were aimed at revising training and testing for new drivers and motorcyclists. The minister said that in 2024, there were 164 people killed or seriously injured in Northern Ireland's roads from crashes caused by a driver aged between 17 and 23. \"This age group of drivers account for 24% of fatal or serious collisions despite holding just 8% of licences,\" she added. Pat Delaney, director of operations in the Driver and Vehicle Agency Northern Ireland (DVANI) said the new measures would affect anyone who gets a provisional driving licence from 1 October. He said the overall aim of these changes was to \"improve road safety\" for young people.\n\nWhat are in NI's graduate driving license rules?\n\nThe major rule changes are: New drivers will not be permitted to take their driving test for at least six months after being granted a provisional licence\n\nThey must also complete 14 modules in a programme of training, which has to be signed off by an approved driving instructor or a supervising driver that could be a parent or guardian\n\nAn increase in the restriction period from 12 months to 24 months requiring new drivers to display an 'R' plate style mark on their vehicles after passing their test - a different colour of 'R' plate will signify a driver in their initial six-month period\n\nFor the first six months after passing their test, new drivers up to the age of 24 are only permitted to have one passenger aged between 14 and 20 in their car between the hours of 23:00 and 06:00\n\nThat restriction would not include immediate family members and does not apply if someone aged 21 or over, who has held a drivers licence for at least three years, is sitting in the front seat\n\nLearner drivers will be allowed to drive on the motorway if accompanied by an approved instructor and will be allowed to drive on the motorway up to the posted speed limit, after passing their test The current speed limit of 45mph for restricted drivers will also be removed. Drivers who do not follow the restrictions could receive three penalty points or a fine of up to £1,000. PSNI Ch Supt Donaldson welcomed the scheme, and said he wished it was introduced immediately. \"Young people who are 17, 18 and new drivers regardless of what age, they don't recognise the risk the way perhaps some of us here a little bit older do,\" he said. \"So I absolutely welcome this graduated response, some restrictions in terms of who they can carry, times of day they can travel and things like that because we've got to bring our new drivers on a slower journey to allow them to learn how to drive on the roads. \"That's the way it's done in Scandinavia and they have far safer roads than we have, so we've got to learn from them and we've got to bring this in.\" The Department for Infrastructure said it would shortly launch a public information campaign about graduated driver licensing, and officials would liaise with approved instructors, the PSNI and a range of others ahead of the new rules being introduced.\n\nWhat have young people said about the changes?\n\n15-year-old Oliver understands why they are making the changes\n\nAt St Mark's High School in Warrenpoint, County Down, present and past pupils from the GCSE Motor Vehicle & Road User Studies class give their reaction to the changes. Oliver, 15, said: \"It would be a bit of an annoyance to not be able to drive right way\" but he does think it makes sense. \"There are people who get their licence too early and aren't experienced enough on the road to be going out and driving themselves.\"\n\nCormac, 17, would not have wanted to wait six months before getting his test\n\nCormac - who passed his driving test in less than six months after his 17th birthday - said he would have understood if they required a \"minimum lessons amount\". But he does welcome the removal of the 45mph speed limit. \"When you're on a dual carriageway and having to go 45mph it does feel more dangerous than safe,\" he said.\n\nAmy, 18, said restricting passenger numbers at night could end up costing more money\n\nAmy, 18, has not got her drivers licence yet, but said she did not like the idea of restricting the passengers she is allowed to take at night time. \"Instead of taking one car load you'd maybe have to take three,\" she said, adding she accepts it is probably for the \"greater good\". \"You wouldn't be getting distracted as much if your friends were sitting beside you trying to show you something.\"\n\n17-year-old Matthew got his driving test within three months of his birthday\n\nMatthew, 17, said it would prevent him from being able to give someone a lift home late at night but thinks it would be safer. \"The majority of accidents do happen at those times. It is safer for everyone.\"\n\nWhat's the view from driving instructors?\n\nDriving instructor Peter Carmichael welcomes the changes but wants to see more details",

      "content": "Caribbean cannabis growers eye budding domestic sales and exports\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Gemma Handy Business reporter, St John’s, Antigua Share Save\n\nGemma Handy Antiguan cannabis grower Michaelus Tracey says that a lot of effort is put into developing new strains\n\nRub the leaf and inhale the fragrance, Michaelus Tracey is saying. The musky scent of this cannabis plant is distinctly different from the citrusy aroma of another that he is also holding. To the untrained eye, the neat rows of flowering cannabis crops in front of us are indistinguishable from each other. Yet master cultivator Tracey can identify the separate varieties by their smell and the shape of their leaves. Nine strains are being grown here at Pineapple Road, a farm deep in the countryside on the Caribbean island of Antigua. The warm temperatures, abundant sunshine, and high humidity make this prime territory for growing the plants. Intense trials were conducted to produce the various strains, Tracey explains. \"We wanted different flavour profiles as well as different effects, but all with a medicinal value - something to help you relax, something to give you more energy, more pain relief, less anxiety.\"\n\nGemma Handy Cannibis plants thrive in Antigua's warm, sunny conditions\n\nLast year marked a decade since Jamaica decriminalised the recreational use of cannabis and legalised its production and sale for medical reasons. Several other Caribbean nations, including the twin island country Antigua and Barbuda in 2018, have since followed suit. Smoking cannabis is emblematic of Caribbean culture, to the extent it has become a cliché. But while the region's affection for the plant is well documented, its status as a leader in the field is less so. Today the region is home to a plethora of legally registered cannabis farms and medicinal dispensaries, where both locals and tourists can purchase the drug if they have a valid medical authorisation card. Yet Prof Rose-Marie Belle Antoine, an expert on the cannabis industry in the Caribbean, believes there needs to be further liberalisation. \"Decriminalisation isn't good enough,\" says Antoine, a former chair of the Caribbean Community's Regional Commission on Marijuana. \"We should just make it legal but regulated.\" Antoine is campus principal at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad, where researchers are due to start studying various potential benefits of cannabis. Areas tipped for study range from alleviating the side effects of cancer treatment, to how the plant can boost agriculture by improving soil health. The research will take place in Antigua, where legislation is more progressive. The work offers \"a lot of potential\", she says, but adds that legalisation would make life easier. \"The Caribbean is a leader in cannabis, in terms of strains and knowledge, and it has a long tradition of this. But legalities, the 'war on drugs' and all that nonsense, stifled not just the industry, but research and development,\" says Antoine.\n\nSome in the region hope that US President Donald Trump's executive order in December to reclassify cannabis as a lower-level drug will benefit the Caribbean. \"It's a significant milestone,\" says Alexandra Chong, chief executive of Jamaica-based business Jacana, which sells a range of products derived from cannabis, from extract oil drops to skin cream. \"So much US public policy gets filtered down to the Caribbean,\" she says. \"Because cannabis was classified as a schedule one drug alongside heroin in the US, regulatory bodies across the Caribbean have not been as bullish with [reducing] regulation.\" Chong adds that the US reducing cannabis to the lower schedule three level, which also includes combined paracetamol-codeine tablets, was \"far more appropriate\". The White House lowering the classification of cannabis may mean that in the future Caribbean nations can export the drug to the US for recreational use. However, the importation of such cannabis into the US is currently still illegal under federal law. This is despite 24 US states having now legalised the use of the drug recreationally. Producers in both Jamaica and Antigua are keen to start legally exporting the drug. Jamaica's Cannabis Licensing Authority says it \"has put in place interim administrative procedures to facilitate the export of ganja by licensees that hold a valid import permit from the country that the product will be exported to\". Meanwhile, Antigua and Barbuda's Medicinal Cannabis Authority is working hard to develop a cannabis export industry. \"We already have the legal framework in place, a prime geographical location and an international airport,\" the body's chief executive Regis Burton tells the BBC. He says it's \"highly likely\" that Antigua will eventually be able to export its products, not least for the novelty value. \"Very few people can say they've tried Antiguan cannabis,\" he adds.\n\nJacana Alexandra Chong hopes that Trump's move will lead to more liberalisation in the Caribbean\n\nDomestically, high overheads in both Jamaica and Antigua and Barbuda – and rules that limit the sale of cannabis to people with medical approval - are said to be leaving most of the market to illegal producers. Jacana estimates that more than 800,000 people a year in Jamaica use cannabis, of whom half are tourists. But that 90% of the 87 tonnes of the drug consumed per annum comes through illicit channels. Chong adds that \"over-regulation has strangled the industry. Over time it's got easier, but it's by no means perfect\". She says that due to these problems, she estimates that of the 160-plus licences of various categories granted by Jamaica's Cannabis Licensing Authority between 2017 and 2024, \"very few\" are still in operation. In Antigua, Robert Hill, a consultant to the industry, says: \"It's still more profitable to import cannabis illegally. Unlike dealers, private companies have staff and bills to pay.\" Currently the island has just six cannabis farms, four dispensaries and a cannabis lounge, where people can smoke on the premises. At the same time, Antiguan authorities intercepted 45kg of illegally imported cannabis in just 24 hours back in September. Meanwhile, Antigua has been innovative in its approach to domestic illegal growers. Instead of prosecutions, violators were invited to take part in a free six-week course to teach them how to enter the market legally. \"Twenty-two have already graduated, with two soon to transition to a medicinal business,\" Burton tells the BBC. \"The industry won't be successful if the illicit market does as it pleases.\"\n\nThe continuing liberalisation of cannabis across the Caribbean is also said to be having a positive impact on social justice for one community in particular. In 2018, Antigua's Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a formal apology to the country's Rastafarians, for decades of historic persecution, stigma and abuse over their cannabis use. Six years later, the government granted Rastafarians official sacramental authorisation to grow the plants. And last summer, it announced plans to expunge the criminal records of people previously prosecuted for possession of small amounts of marijuana.\n\nGemma Handy Rastafarian High Priest Selah, left, says that efforts to allow the legal use of cannabis were hard fought",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The Darfur region of Sudan has suffered from violent conflict and serious crimes for many years. Since 2005, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity there, following a request from the United Nations Security Council.\n\n**What happened** – On January 19, 2026, ICC Deputy Prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan updated the UN Security Council about recent findings in Darfur. She spoke remotely because she was denied a visa to travel to New York, due to US sanctions against some ICC officials. Khan reported that in October 2025, a militia called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) committed mass killings and other abuses in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur. She warned that similar attacks are continuing in other parts of Darfur. She also asked countries to provide more support and resources to help the ICC continue its investigations.\n\n**Impact** – A major milestone was reached in 2025 when the ICC convicted Ali Kosheib, a former militia leader known as Janjaweed, for war crimes committed in 2003-2004. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. This was the first time victims in Darfur saw justice through the ICC after two decades. The ICC’s ongoing work is crucial because violence and abuses still happen in the region. However, US sanctions could make it harder for the ICC to do its work worldwide.\n\n**What's next step** – The Security Council and ICC members expressed regret that Khan could not speak in person and promised to protect the ICC’s mission. They need to increase support, provide enough resources, and encourage the US to lift sanctions on ICC officials. This will help the court keep investigating and bringing justice to victims in Darfur and other conflict zones.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The ICC’s conviction of a Darfur war criminal marks important progress in justice, but continued support is needed to address ongoing crimes and protect the court’s work worldwide.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – La région du Darfour au Soudan connaît des conflits violents et des crimes graves depuis de nombreuses années. Depuis 2005, la Cour pénale internationale (CPI) enquête sur des crimes de guerre et des crimes contre l’humanité, suite à une demande du Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Le 19 janvier 2026, la procureure adjointe de la CPI, Nazhat Shameem Khan, a informé le Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU des dernières découvertes au Darfour. Elle a parlé à distance car elle n’a pas obtenu de visa pour se rendre à New York, en raison des sanctions américaines contre certains responsables de la CPI. Khan a rapporté qu’en octobre 2025, une milice appelée Forces de soutien rapide (RSF) a commis des massacres et d’autres abus à El Fasher, capitale du Nord-Darfour. Elle a averti que des attaques similaires continuent dans d’autres régions du Darfour. Elle a aussi demandé aux pays d’apporter plus de soutien et de ressources pour aider la CPI à poursuivre ses enquêtes.\n\n**Impact** – Une étape majeure a été atteinte en 2025 lorsque la CPI a condamné Ali Kosheib, un ancien chef de milice Janjaweed, pour des crimes de guerre commis en 2003-2004. Il a été condamné à 20 ans de prison. C’est la première fois que les victimes du Darfour voient la justice grâce à la CPI après vingt ans. Le travail continu de la CPI est essentiel car la violence et les abus se poursuivent dans la région. Cependant, les sanctions américaines pourraient compliquer le travail de la CPI dans le monde.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – Le Conseil de sécurité et les membres de la CPI ont exprimé leur regret que Khan n’ait pas pu s’exprimer en personne et ont promis de protéger la mission de la CPI. Ils doivent augmenter le soutien, fournir des ressources suffisantes et encourager les États-Unis à lever les sanctions contre les responsables de la CPI. Cela aidera la Cour à continuer ses enquêtes et à rendre justice aux victimes au Darfour et ailleurs.\n\n**En une phrase** – La condamnation d’un criminel de guerre au Darfour par la CPI marque un progrès important en matière de justice, mais un soutien continu est nécessaire pour lutter contre les crimes persistants et protéger le travail de la Cour dans le monde.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – La región de Darfur en Sudán ha sufrido conflictos violentos y graves crímenes durante muchos años. Desde 2005, la Corte Penal Internacional (CPI) investiga crímenes de guerra y crímenes contra la humanidad, tras una solicitud del Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El 19 de enero de 2026, la fiscal adjunta de la CPI, Nazhat Shameem Khan, actualizó al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU sobre los hallazgos recientes en Darfur. Habló de forma remota porque no le concedieron una visa para viajar a Nueva York, debido a sanciones de Estados Unidos contra algunos funcionarios de la CPI. Khan informó que en octubre de 2025, una milicia llamada Fuerzas de Apoyo Rápido (RSF) cometió asesinatos masivos y otros abusos en El Fasher, la capital del norte de Darfur. Advirtió que ataques similares continúan en otras partes de Darfur. También pidió a los países más apoyo y recursos para ayudar a la CPI a continuar sus investigaciones.\n\n**Impacto** – En 2025, la CPI alcanzó un hito importante al condenar a Ali Kosheib, un exlíder de la milicia Janjaweed, por crímenes de guerra cometidos en 2003-2004. Fue sentenciado a 20 años de prisión. Esta fue la primera vez que las víctimas de Darfur vieron justicia a través de la CPI después de veinte años. El trabajo continuo de la CPI es clave porque la violencia y los abusos siguen ocurriendo en la región. Sin embargo, las sanciones de EE.UU. podrían dificultar el trabajo de la CPI en todo el mundo.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El Consejo de Seguridad y los miembros de la CPI lamentaron que Khan no pudiera hablar en persona y prometieron proteger la misión de la CPI. Necesitan aumentar el apoyo, proporcionar suficientes recursos y pedir a EE.UU. que levante las sanciones contra los funcionarios de la CPI. Esto ayudará a la Corte a seguir investigando y llevando justicia a las víctimas en Darfur y en otras zonas de conflicto.\n\n**Mensaje en una frase** – La condena de un criminal de guerra en Darfur por parte de la CPI representa un avance importante en justicia, pero se necesita apoyo continuo para enfrentar los crímenes que siguen ocurriendo y proteger el trabajo de la Corte en todo el mundo.",

Cyprus recognizes North Macedonia’s commitment to advancing reforms and aligning with European standards and encourages the country’s constant and continuous efforts in that direction, said Fotiou.\n\nSkopje – The Cypriot ambassador to North Macedonia, Andreas Fotiou, today, before the joint session of the National Council for Euro-Integration and the Parliamentary Committee on European Affairs, presented the priorities of Cyprus as the current holder of the EU presidency for the next six months, emphasizing that Cyprus will remain committed to regular and open dialogue with the Western Balkans, and that North Macedonia remains part of the EU enlargement process.\n\nFotiou pointed out that the Cypriot presidency, whose motto is “An autonomous Union open to the world”, means that the European Union must be autonomous because a more autonomous Union will demonstrate the necessary internal strength to cooperate with external partners whenever possible, while at the same time acting independently when necessary, respecting international law and order.\n\nThe Cypriot ambassador stressed that the Western Balkans remains a region of strategic importance for the EU, and the Union’s engagement with North Macedonia will continue with a credible, merit-based policy.\n\n– The Cypriot presidency pays attention to regular and open dialogue with the Western Balkans, and North Macedonia remains part of the Union’s enlargement process. Cyprus recognizes North Macedonia’s commitment to advancing reforms and aligning with European standards and encourages the country’s constant and continuous efforts in that direction – said Fotiou.\n\nThe ambassador presented the five pillars of the Cypriot presidency of the Union, according to which, he pointed out, Cyprus will focus on autonomy through security and defense, autonomy through competitiveness, openness to the world, shared values, and negotiations on the budget for the next EU financial framework.\n\nThe newly appointed Minister for European Affairs Bekim Sali, in his address at the session, pointed out that the country’s European integration is not an administrative process, nor a technical agenda, but a civilizational determination that enjoys social support.\n\n– For us, European integration is a clear state orientation that unites the government and the opposition, the institutions and the citizens. In a time of serious geopolitical turmoil, the enlargement policy is not an option but a necessity; it is also an investment in a stable and autonomous EU. In this picture, North Macedonia is part of the solution – said Sali.\n\nHe emphasized that the country continuously shows that it is a credible and responsible partner with the EU.\n\nAccording to him, the accession process is not easy, which is why the country does not treat the implementation of reforms as an externally imposed obligation, but as an internal issue. This, Sali says, is our conscious political choice to strengthen the state and institutional capacities.\n\n– For us, EU enlargement is an inseparable part of this vision. Europe cannot be complete if the Western Balkans remains on the margins; North Macedonia is ready to close that European political gap and become part of those agreements. That is why today we are sending a clear message – North Macedonia is ready, and this is a moment of political maturity both for North Macedonia and for the EU, a moment that neither we nor the EU must miss – emphasized Sali.
