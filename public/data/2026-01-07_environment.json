      "content": "How Christmas trees are getting a new lease of life\n\n23 hours ago Share Save Gem O'Reilly , reporting from Peckham , Leyla Hayes , reporting from Dulwich and James W Kelly , London Share Save\n\nBBC Caelo Dineen Vanstone and Hugo Knox co-founded a firm turning Christmas trees into building material\n\nAs Christmas decorations come down, London's streets will be strewn with real trees waiting to be picked up by council workers, raising questions about their environmental impact and what can be done to reduce waste. Around seven million Christmas trees in the UK end up in landfill each year, according to industry estimates. In response, a growing number of schemes in the capital are offering more sustainable alternatives. One option is to rent a living Christmas tree rather than buying a cut one. At London Christmas Tree Rental, all of the trees are potted and returned after the festive season to be grown on for reuse the following year. \"Just simply, rent, water, return,\" said Jonathan Mearns, the founder of the company.\n\nJonathan Mearns said some customers have had the same tree for years\n\n\"You can rent via our website, pick your dates, come along to one of the hubs to choose your tree, water it, bring it back, and then it grows on.\" The trees are available from four hubs across London, including one in Dulwich, south-east London, before being sent back to a farm once Christmas is over. Some customers are reunited with the same tree the following year. \"Sometimes people come back and say, 'is that really my tree?'\" Mearns said. \"We get pictures and we'll compare, and they'll say actually it is, it's just grown a little bit, so people love it.\"\n\nSome councils provide a collection service for real trees to be collected and recycled on designated days\n\n\"We've been doing it about four years now,\" one customer told BBC London. \"I just like the idea, it's more environmentally friendly.\"\n\nA separate scheme in Peckham, south-east London, is focused on repurposing trees once they are no longer needed. The ORNA Group works to turn discarded Christmas trees into construction materials. Hugo Knox, one of its co-founders, said the idea grew out of first-hand experience of selling real trees. He said: \"Back in November 2019, I left my first job coming out of university. \"I rang up one of my close friends, Max. I said, look, 'it's Christmas, Christmas trees, shall we give it a go?'\" He said the pair initially went door-to-door in Camberwell offering trees and installations, before expanding the idea into a seasonal business. \"But from that I learned a lot about Christmas tree waste and saw all of the waste first-hand in the streets of London, and that's what led to ORNA Group,\" he said.\n\nThe environmental impact of discarded trees can be significant, according to the Carbon Trust. It said on average a real Christmas tree produces about 3.5kg of carbon dioxide emissions, but a 2m tree sent to landfill without its roots can have a carbon footprint of 16kg. The trust said an artificial tree used over several years creates lower emission levels overall. Most London boroughs have schemes where trees can be recycled to reduce the number going to landfill. Information on your council's scheme can be found at London Recycles. At the ORNA workshop, real trees collected from homes and businesses are chipped and combined with natural binders to create new materials.\n\nDineen Vanstone turns the Christmas tree shavings into construction material\n\n\"When it arrives here, it's mostly unprocessed,\" said material scientist Caelo Dineen Vanstone, another of the start-up's co-founders. \"The trees have come straight out of houses or businesses in different forms, but it comes here chipped up into the right consistency.\" She said the process involved cooking and modifying natural ingredients before combining them with the tree waste \"to create a homogenous wet material\". The project also works with young people to show how small actions can make a difference. \"We're not trying to change the world quite yet,\" Dineen Vanstone said. \"But it's just about trying to make our street corner a little bit nicer and trying to do something positive rather than doing something that's going to impact our future generations in a negative way.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Every year, millions of real Christmas trees in the UK end up in landfill, causing environmental problems. In London, new ideas are being tested to reduce this waste and lower carbon emissions related to discarded trees.\n\n**What happened** – Two main projects in London are changing how Christmas trees are used. One company, London Christmas Tree Rental, lets people rent living trees that they return after Christmas to be grown again. Another group, the ORNA Group, collects used trees and turns them into building materials by chipping the wood and mixing it with natural binders.\n\n**Impact** – These projects help stop millions of trees from being thrown away and reduce harmful gases released when trees decompose in landfill. Renting trees means families can enjoy a fresh tree year after year without cutting a new one down. Turning old trees into construction materials gives them a useful purpose instead of waste.\n\n**What's next step** – Both groups plan to keep growing their work, reaching more people and improving their methods. They also involve young people to raise awareness about recycling and environmental care.

      "title": "This simple math trick could transform earthquake science",
      "summary": "Earthquakes happen daily, sometimes with devastating consequences, yet predicting them remains out of reach. What scientists can do is map the hidden layers beneath the surface that control how strongly the ground shakes. A new approach speeds up complex seismic simulations by a factor of about 1,000, making risk assessments far more practical. While it won’t forecast the next quake, it could help cities better prepare for one.",
      "content": "On December 6, 2025, a powerful 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Alaska. While quakes of that size draw attention, earthquakes occur far more often than many people realize. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that roughly 55 earthquakes happen every day worldwide, adding up to about 20,000 each year. Typically, one earthquake per year reaches a magnitude of 8.0 or higher, while around 15 others fall within the magnitude 7 range on the Richter scale, which measures the amount of energy released. In 2025 alone, an offshore 8.8 earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula ranked among the 10 strongest earthquakes ever recorded, according to USGS.\n\nEarthquakes can cause loss of life, destroy buildings and roads, disrupt economies, and leave lasting emotional scars on those affected. Their financial impact is also increasing. A 2023 report from USGS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) found that earthquake damage now costs the United States an estimated $14.7 billion each year. One major reason is that more people are living in regions where seismic activity is common.\n\nBeing able to forecast when and where a major earthquake will strike would greatly improve preparedness and reduce harm. Despite decades of research, scientists still cannot predict earthquakes with reliable accuracy.\n\nUnderstanding the Ground Beneath Our Feet\n\nWhile timing remains unpredictable, understanding what lies beneath the Earth's surface can significantly improve risk assessments. Kathrin Smetana, Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Stevens, explains that underground materials vary widely. \"You may have layers of solid rock, or you may have sand or clay,\" she says. Because seismic waves move differently through each material, the type of subsurface strongly influences how shaking is felt at the surface.\n\nHow Scientists Image the Subsurface\n\nTo map these underground layers, researchers use a method known as Full Waveform Inversion. This seismic imaging technique helps reconstruct the structure of the subsurface by combining simulations with real earthquake data. Scientists first generate computer-based earthquakes and track how seismic waves travel through the Earth. They then analyze the simulated wave patterns at seismograph locations and compare them with real seismograms, which are graphical records of ground motion from actual earthquakes. After many rounds of refinement, the simulated data begins to closely match real observations, offering a clearer picture of underground conditions.\n\nIn practice, researchers begin with an initial estimate of the subsurface in a given area. They repeatedly adjust this model, running new simulations each time, until it aligns with real earthquake measurements.\n\n\"You compare the data from your computer simulation with actual data that you got from earthquakes,\" says Smetana. \"This allows you to find out what the subsurface looks like and what effect an earthquake has on the composition of the subsurface -- and that ultimately, helps determine the risk for an earthquake at a certain location.\"\n\nThis approach plays a crucial role in improving earthquake monitoring and risk assessment tools. However, it comes with a major drawback. Each simulation can involve millions of variables and must be repeated thousands of times. According to Smetana, a single simulation using traditional methods can take several hours even on advanced computing clusters. Running enough simulations to support ongoing monitoring can quickly become too expensive and time consuming.\n\nA Faster Way to Simulate Earthquakes\n\nTo overcome this barrier, Smetana teamed up with computational seismologists Rhys Hawkins and Jeannot Trampert from Utrecht University, along with Matthias Schlottbom and Muhammad Hamza Khalid from the University of Twente in the Netherlands. Together, they developed a streamlined model that dramatically reduces the computational burden while preserving accuracy.\n\n\"Essentially we reduced the size of the system that you need to solve by about 1000 times,\" Smetana says. \"It was a very interdisciplinary project, and we found a clever way to construct the reduced model while still maintaining the accuracy of the prediction. I really enjoy interdisciplinary collaborations and this one in particular because you learn to see things with a new perspective, which, in my opinion, ultimately helps finding creative and novel approaches to solve a problem in an interdisciplinary team.\"\n\nTheir research is detailed in a paper titled \"Model Order Reduction for Seismic Applications,\" published in the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing.\n\nImproving Risk Assessment, Not Prediction\n\nThe new model does not make it possible to predict when earthquakes will occur. Instead, it offers a more efficient way to evaluate earthquake risk in different locations. \"If you get a good picture of the subsurface, you have a better idea of assessing the risk of future earthquakes,\" Smetana explains.\n\nThe same modeling approach could eventually help scientists simulate tsunamis triggered by undersea earthquakes. In many cases, tsunamis take at least an hour to reach land after an earthquake, depending on where the rupture occurs. That time window could allow researchers to run rapid simulations that inform emergency responses.\n\nToward Greater Earthquake Resilience\n\nAccurate images of the subsurface are key to understanding how earthquakes affect different regions. \"There's no way to predict earthquakes at this time,\" Smetana says. \"But our work can help generate a realistic view of the subsurface with less computational power, which would make our models more practical and help us be more earthquake resilient.\"",

Ocean sensors confirmed the quake’s rupture was longer than earlier models suggested. Together, the findings could reshape how tsunamis are modeled and predicted.",
      "content": "A satellite designed to measure the height of the ocean surface was in the right place at the right time when a powerful earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula sent a tsunami across the Pacific in late July.\n\nThe spacecraft, known as the Surface Water Ocean Topography or SWOT satellite, recorded the first high resolution space-based track of a major subduction zone tsunami, according to researchers writing in The Seismic Record.\n\nInstead of a simple wave moving cleanly across the ocean, the satellite data revealed a surprisingly intricate pattern of waves spreading, interacting, and scattering across the basin. Scientists say this detailed view could improve understanding of how tsunamis travel and how they may ultimately affect coastlines.\n\nCombining satellite data with ocean sensors\n\nTo better understand the event, Angel Ruiz-Angulo of the University of Iceland and his colleagues combined the satellite observations with measurements from DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) buoys located along the tsunami's path. These deep-ocean sensors helped them refine estimates of the earthquake that triggered the waves.\n\nThe July 29 earthquake struck in the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone with a magnitude of 8.8, making it the sixth largest earthquake recorded worldwide since 1900.\n\n\"I think of SWOT data as a new pair of glasses,\" said Ruiz-Angulo. \"Before, with DARTs we could only see the tsunami at specific points in the vastness of the ocean. There have been other satellites before, but they only see a thin line across a tsunami in the best-case scenario. Now, with SWOT, we can capture a swath up to about 120 kilometers wide, with unprecedented high-resolution data of the sea surface.\"\n\nA satellite built for water, not disasters\n\nSWOT was launched in December 2022 as a joint mission between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. Its main goal is to deliver the first global survey of Earth's surface water, including oceans, rivers, and lakes.\n\nRuiz-Angulo said he and co-author Charly de Marez had spent more than two years studying SWOT data to understand everyday ocean features such as small eddies. \"[We] had been analyzing SWOT data for over two years understanding different processes in the ocean like small eddies, never imagining that we would be fortunate enough to capture a tsunami.\"\n\nRethinking how giant tsunamis behave\n\nBecause the wavelength of large tsunamis is much longer than the depth of the ocean, scientists have traditionally described them as \"non-dispersive.\" In simple terms, this means the wave is expected to travel as a single, stable form rather than breaking into multiple waves that spread out over time.\n\n\"The SWOT data for this event has challenged the idea of big tsunamis being non-dispersive,\" Ruiz-Angulo explains.\n\nWhen the team compared the satellite observations with computer simulations, they found that tsunami models that included dispersion matched the real-world data more closely than traditional models.\n\n\"The main impact that this observation has for tsunami modelers is that we are missing something in the models we used to run,\" Ruiz-Angulo added. \"This 'extra' variability could represent that the main wave could be modulated by the trailing waves as it approaches some coast. We would need to quantify this excess of dispersive energy and evaluate if it has an impact that was not considered before.\"\n\nA longer earthquake rupture than expected\n\nThe researchers also noticed a mismatch between tsunami arrival times predicted by earlier models and the actual measurements recorded by two DART tide gauges. One gauge recorded the tsunami earlier than expected, while the other detected it later.\n\nUsing the buoy data in a technique known as inversion, the team reexamined the source of the tsunami. Their analysis suggested the earthquake rupture extended farther south than previously thought and stretched about 400 kilometers -- significantly longer than the 300 kilometers estimated by other models.\n\n\"Ever since the 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake in Japan, we realized that the tsunami data had really valuable information for constraining shallow slip,\" said study co-author Diego Melgar.\n\nWhy mixing data matters\n\nSince that 2011 disaster, Melgar's research group and others have worked to better integrate DART buoy data into earthquake and tsunami analyses. However, this approach is still not routine.\n\nSince then, Melgar's lab and others have been working on ways to include DART data in inversions, \"but it is still not always done because the hydrodynamic models needed to model DARTs are very different than the seismic wave propagation ones for modeling the solid Earth data. But, as shown here again, it is really important we mix as many types of data as possible,\" Melgar said.\n\nImproving future tsunami warnings\n\nThe Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone has produced some of the largest tsunamis on record, including a devastating event in 1952 triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake. That disaster led to the creation of the international tsunami warning system that later issued alerts across the Pacific during the 2025 event.\n\n\"With some luck, maybe one day results like ours can be used to justify why these satellite observations are needed for real or near-real time forecasting,\" Ruiz-Angulo said.",

      "content": "Biofuels, such as rapeseed, are not an ideal alternative to non-fossil carbon.Credit: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nThere’s a relatively new word doing the rounds in sustainability research and policy: defossilization. Beyond expert circles, it isn’t necessarily obvious that phasing out fossil fuels does not mean phasing out carbon. Under net-zero scenarios, carbon-based fuels are still needed, to provide power, for example, and for aviation. Carbon, currently often derived from fossil hydrocarbons, is also integral to everyday consumer products such as soaps and detergents, as well as medicines, fertilizers and plastics.\n\nWorldwide, demand for ‘embedded’ carbon — that found in chemicals — is expected to double by 2050, according to the nova-Institute, a green-energy research institute in Hürth, Germany (see go.nature.com/4jpx6qi). But this carbon cannot come from the usual sources, such as coal, natural gas and oil. These must remain in the ground, and this is where defossilization comes in.\n\nChemistry can make plastics sustainable – but isn’t the whole solution\n\nDefossilization means finding sustainable ways to make carbon-based chemicals. Alternative sources of carbon include the atmosphere and plants, as well as carbon in existing biological or industrial waste, such as used plastics or agricultural residue. In some cases, these chemicals will eventually return carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through burning or biodegradation. In principle, this will occur as part of a circular process, rather than one that has added greenhouse gases.\n\nThe subject of defossilization is of increasing research interest — as it needs to be — despite signs that some governments, including a number in Europe and that of the United States, are backsliding on their climate commitments. In this two-part Editorial, we describe some of the challenges faced by researchers, in both academia and industry, that scientists and policymakers need to solve to enable defossilization to happen on the scale required. In this first instalment, we focus on Europe. In the next, we explore advances under way in China.\n\nBiomass from crops is a key source of non-fossil carbon, and one that can be obtained at scale. One driver of large-scale production is the European Union’s biofuels strategy. This mandates that transport fuels include biomass-derived products. Examples include biodiesel, which can be made from oils such as sunflower and palm, and bioethanol, which is synthesized from crops such as maize (corn) and wheat. But clearing existing cropland or converting uncultivated land to grow biofuels can’t be the alternative of choice, not least because of the attendant risk to biodiversity and soil health, and the demand it puts on water resources. There’s also some evidence that, by encouraging farmers to convert land previously used to grow food crops, the directive has pushed up food prices.\n\nReinvent oil refineries for a net-zero future\n\nThe extraction of carbon from lignocellulose — tough plant matter — in crop waste is an alternative with potential that remains mostly untapped. One major advantage is the fact that it can be produced without the use of extra land. But it is expensive to extract, and production timelines are long, both of which hinder scalability1.\n\nOther potential sources of waste carbon include municipal and industrial waste, with used plastic among this. More than 40% of plastic produced in the EU is already recycled. This recycling rate could be increased if technical challenges can be surmounted2. Current recycling methods break waste plastics into flakes through shredding or melting, then form pellets that can be used to make new products. For higher recycling rates to be achieved, chemical recycling methods will need to be further developed and scaled up. These methods break down plastics into smaller molecules that can be used to rebuild new, larger ones.\n\nCarbon dioxide captured from fossil-fuel burning or the air offers one of the largest potential avenues for defossilization. The global chemicals industry could obtain one-third of its carbon needs from this source by 2050, according to the nova-Institute. That compares with 22% from biomass. By one estimate, there are almost 900 gigatonnes of carbon in the atmosphere, nearly double the 450 gigatonnes of carbon contained in vegetation3. But the scenarios for 2050 vary widely. Some say CO 2 will become the main feedstock for chemicals, whereas others say its contribution will be negligible.\n\nHow fast fashion can cut its staggering environmental impact\n\nTo make useful carbon-based molecules, CO 2 must first be transformed into other molecules. Usually, it is reacted with hydrogen, either to form hydrocarbons or to remove an oxygen atom. Because CO 2 is highly stable, a considerable amount of energy is needed to overcome the thermodynamic barrier to these reactions. This must be powered renewably for the process to be truly sustainable. Capturing atmospheric CO 2 is difficult and expensive, in part because of the compound’s stability. As a result, the technology has not been a priority for European governments. This must change.\n\nIn May, Elisa Morgera, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights in the context of climate change, published a report urging governments to defossilize economies as part of the fossil-fuel phase-out. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Society and the Institution of Chemical Engineers have urged the government to support research on defossilization. They have a strong case, because such research, which is intended to boost the chemical industry, aligns with government policies to invest in science that supports economic growth. The EU and China also have a joint research programme called the EU–China Bridge, which is focused on decarbonization, but this is set to expire next year. This not only needs to be renewed, it needs a renewed focus — on defossilization.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas have long been the main sources of carbon for making energy and everyday products. But to fight climate change, we need to stop using fossil fuels. The challenge is that carbon itself is still very important in things like medicines, plastics, and fertilizers.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists and experts are now focusing on “defossilization,” which means making carbon-based chemicals without using fossil fuels. Instead, they use carbon from plants, waste materials, and even carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the air. Europe is working on this by using crop waste and recycling plastics better. Some methods, like turning CO2 into useful chemicals, need more energy and technology but could provide a big part of the solution.\n\n**Impact** – This approach keeps carbon in our products while protecting the planet by leaving fossil fuels underground. It also helps reduce greenhouse gases because the carbon used comes from natural or recycled sources that can be part of a cycle, rather than adding new pollution. For example, using crop waste doesn’t require clearing new land, which helps protect nature and food supplies.\n\n**What's next step** – Governments and researchers need to invest more in developing these defossilization methods, especially improving recycling and CO2 capture. Europe and China have worked together on this, but their program is ending soon and needs to continue. Strong support and new policies will help make these sustainable carbon sources widely available.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Defossilization offers a promising way to keep using carbon in products without relying on fossil fuels, helping industries and the environment at the same time.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les combustibles fossiles comme le charbon, le pétrole et le gaz naturel ont longtemps été les principales sources de carbone pour produire de l’énergie et des objets du quotidien. Mais pour lutter contre le changement climatique, il faut arrêter de les utiliser. Le carbone reste cependant essentiel dans des produits comme les médicaments, les plastiques et les engrais.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Les scientifiques se concentrent désormais sur la « défossilisation », c’est-à-dire produire des produits chimiques à base de carbone sans utiliser de combustibles fossiles. Ils utilisent à la place du carbone provenant des plantes, des déchets ou même du dioxyde de carbone (CO2) capturé dans l’air. L’Europe travaille sur ces solutions en valorisant les déchets de cultures et en améliorant le recyclage des plastiques. Certaines méthodes, comme transformer le CO2 en produits utiles, demandent encore beaucoup d’énergie et de progrès technologiques, mais elles pourraient être une grande partie de la solution.\n\n**Impact** – Cette approche permet de conserver le carbone dans nos produits tout en protégeant la planète, en laissant les combustibles fossiles sous terre. Elle aide aussi à réduire les gaz à effet de serre, car le carbone utilisé vient de sources naturelles ou recyclées qui font partie d’un cycle, sans ajouter de pollution nouvelle. Par exemple, utiliser les déchets agricoles n’exige pas de défricher de nouvelles terres, ce qui préserve la nature et les ressources alimentaires.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les gouvernements et les chercheurs doivent investir davantage dans le développement de ces méthodes de défossilisation, surtout pour améliorer le recyclage et la capture du CO2. L’Europe et la Chine ont collaboré, mais leur programme arrive à sa fin et doit être prolongé. Un soutien fort et de nouvelles politiques aideront à rendre ces sources de carbone durables accessibles à grande échelle.\n\n**En résumé** – La défossilisation offre une voie prometteuse pour continuer à utiliser le carbone dans les produits sans dépendre des combustibles fossiles, aidant à la fois l’industrie et l’environnement.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Los combustibles fósiles como el carbón, el petróleo y el gas natural han sido durante mucho tiempo las principales fuentes de carbono para producir energía y objetos cotidianos. Pero para combatir el cambio climático, debemos dejar de usarlos. Sin embargo, el carbono sigue siendo esencial en productos como medicamentos, plásticos y fertilizantes.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Científicos y expertos ahora se enfocan en la “defossilización”, que significa fabricar productos químicos basados en carbono sin usar combustibles fósiles.

Algunos métodos, como convertir el CO2 en productos útiles, requieren más energía y tecnología, pero podrían ser una gran parte de la solución.\n\n**Impacto** – Este método mantiene el carbono en nuestros productos mientras protege el planeta al dejar los combustibles fósiles bajo tierra. También ayuda a reducir los gases de efecto invernadero porque el carbono proviene de fuentes naturales o recicladas que forman parte de un ciclo, en lugar de añadir nueva contaminación. Por ejemplo, usar residuos de cultivos no requiere limpiar nuevas tierras, lo que ayuda a proteger la naturaleza y los alimentos.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Gobiernos e investigadores deben invertir más en desarrollar estos métodos de defossilización, especialmente en mejorar el reciclaje y la captura de CO2. Europa y China han trabajado juntas, pero su programa está por terminar y necesita continuar.
