      "summary": "The Polish nuclear power plant is to have a capacity of 3750 MW.",
      "content": "The European Commission has approved Poland’s provision of aid for the construction of a nuclear power plant; the first 4 billion PLN for the investment will be provided this month, Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced on Tuesday. The approval for granting support was issued in record time, added Energy Minister Miłosz Motyka.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission officially approved Poland’s provision of state aid for the construction of a nuclear power plant.\n\n“We’ve got it! Billions in state aid for the construction of the first Polish nuclear power plant. There is Europe’s approval and there is money. The first four billion already this month,” the prime minister wrote on X.\n\nMinister Motyka pointed out that this is another step towards building the first Polish nuclear power plant. He added that the decision was issued in record time, in less than 12 months. “We submitted the application, carried out the process and obtained approval in record time (…) in less than a year. We are now moving on to the key phase of the investment. This is the real dimension of the energy transition, this is the building of energy sovereignty, this is a guarantee of stable energy and energy security,” Motyka said in a video posted on X.\n\n“Today, Poland is the fastest-growing large EU economy. We need a stable and safe source of energy. Nuclear power is precisely such a source,” said Finance and Economy Minister Andrzej Domański in a video published on X.\n\nDuring a press conference after the meeting of the Council of Ministers, Motyka stated that the green light from the European Commission for state aid in the construction of a nuclear power plant means that Poland will now be able “to freely begin further investment steps in this area.” He added that in 2027 an application for a construction permit for the power plant will be submitted, and in 2028 construction work will begin: “pouring the first concrete for the reactor, so that everything is finalized according to plan in 2036, in order to be able then to start the actual commissioning of the nuclear power plant.”\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Ministry of Energy pointed out that the European Commission had accepted “a complete support model for the project to build the first nuclear power plant in Poland (…) in line with the expectations of the Polish side.” It added that Poland submitted the notification request in September 2024, and the decision was made “almost twice as fast as in the case of the last decision of this type in Europe.”\n\n“The construction of the first Polish nuclear power plant is becoming a fact, and the decision of the European Commission underlines the enormous strength of the project we are implementing. (…) Nuclear energy will be one of the foundations of the Polish energy mix. Today we have taken an extremely important step towards unleashing it. Nuclear power will become the foundation of Poland’s electricity security and a driver of our economic development. Today we are already the world’s 20th-largest economy. With nuclear, we can reach even further,” said Motyka, quoted in the Ministry of Energy’s statement. The ministry also stressed that the first nuclear power plant in Poland is the largest investment in the energy sector in Poland’s history.\n\nThe ministry explained that the support mechanism includes three basic elements: recapitalization of the investor, i.e. the company Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe (PEJ) by the State Treasury, State Treasury guarantees for the project covering 100 percent of debt financing, and a two-way contract for difference for the operational phase of the power plant.\n\nIt added that the contract for difference will be shortened from 60 to 40 years, which remains consistent with the debt repayment cycle. It also assumes the inclusion of long-term markets (PPA, forward) in the settlement system and the possibility of flexibly adjusting production if this is economically and technically justified.\n\n“The adopted model provides the investor with predictable revenues while at the same time protecting consumers. A mechanism for sharing extraordinary profits has been introduced which—if they occur—will go directly to the state budget and will be able to finance public tasks. The contract for difference is also a tool used by other European Union countries developing nuclear power: the Czech Republic, Belgium, Sweden, France, the Netherlands and Bulgaria,” the energy ministry wrote.\n\nAs stated, up to 30 percent of production will be sold through PPA auctions, and the remaining 70 percent will go to organized markets (exchanges), with full transparency of the process.\n\nThe financial model verified by the European Commission assumes a strike price of below 500 PLN per MWh, which is competitive, particularly taking into account the numerous benefits that the nuclear power plant will provide for the entire power system.\n\nThe Polish nuclear power plant is to have a capacity of 3750 MW. The projected capacity factor of the plant in 2040 is about 88.5 percent, the ministry said in the statement.\n\nDeputy Energy Minister and government plenipotentiary for strategic energy infrastructure Wojciech Wrochna, quoted by the Ministry of Energy, assessed that the European Commission’s decision is one of the key stages of this project. He added that, as part of the dialogue with the European Commission, the Polish side clarified “all, even the smallest” doubts of the Commission. “Receiving the final decision of the European Commission is the culmination of the extremely hard work of our team. It served to develop a mechanism that will make it possible to finance and implement the project to build a nuclear power plant, taking into account the interests of the state, the investor and, most importantly, electricity consumers. (…) This investment will be completed—we are convinced of that,” Wrochna explained.\n\nAs Prime Minister Tusk said before the government meeting on Tuesday, the construction of the power plant “will be able to start at full speed, and already in December.” He declared that financial resources have been secured in full, i.e. the amount of 60 billion PLN. Referring to the European Commission’s approval, Tusk stated that it was “an absolutely necessary condition and by no means so easy to obtain.” “We will indeed be able to start this construction with the appropriate momentum so that electricity from the first nuclear power plant in Poland will flow as soon as possible,” he said.\n\nThe company Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe, 100 percent owned by the State Treasury, is the investor and future operator of the first nuclear power plant being built in Pomerania under the 2020 Polish Nuclear Power Programme. The plant at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site is to have three units using Westinghouse AP1000 technology. The contractor will be the Westinghouse-Bechtel consortium. The pouring of the so-called first nuclear concrete is planned for 2028, and the start of commercial operation of the first unit is scheduled for 2036. (9.12.2025)",

      "title": "The deep ocean is fixing carbon in ways no one expected",
      "summary": "Researchers have uncovered surprising evidence that the deep ocean’s carbon-fixing engine works very differently than long assumed. While ammonia-oxidizing archaea were thought to dominate carbon fixation in the sunless depths, experiments show that other microbes—especially heterotrophs—are doing far more of the work than expected. This discovery reshapes our understanding of how carbon moves through the deep ocean and stabilizes Earth’s climate.",
      "content": "In an effort to better understand how the ocean stores carbon, researchers at UC Santa Barbara and their collaborators have uncovered results that challenge long-held ideas about how carbon dioxide is \"fixed\" in the dark, deep sea. Led by UCSB microbial oceanographer Alyson Santoro, the team reports in Nature Geoscience that their work helps close a long-standing gap between estimates of nitrogen availability and measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fixation in deep waters.\n\n\"Something that we've been trying to get a better handle on is how much of the carbon in the ocean is getting fixed,\" Santoro said. \"The numbers work out now, which is great.\"\n\nThis project was supported in part by the National Science Foundation.\n\nThe ocean as a planetary carbon sink\n\nWho's doing the fixing? The ocean is the Earth's largest carbon sink, soaking up roughly a third of human carbon dioxide emissions and helping to keep global temperatures in check. Because we rely so heavily on this natural buffering capacity, scientists are keen to untangle the complex processes that control how carbon enters, moves through, and is stored in the sea.\n\n\"We want to know how carbon moves around the deep ocean, because in order for the ocean to impact the climate, carbon has to make it from the atmosphere to the deep ocean,\" Santoro said.\n\nMuch of this inorganic carbon fixation is carried out by microscopic life. At the surface, phytoplankton, which are single-celled, photosynthetic organisms, take up inorganic carbon dioxide (including dissolved carbon dioxide gas). As autotrophs, they manufacture their own food in a way similar to land plants, using carbon dioxide and water to build organic matter (sugars) and release oxygen.\n\nOld assumptions about deep-ocean microbes\n\nScientists have generally believed that most DIC fixation occurs in the sunlit surface layer thanks to photosynthetic phytoplankton, but that a meaningful amount of non-photosynthetic DIC fixation also takes place in the deeper, darker regions of the ocean. In these sunless waters, the process was thought to be dominated by autotrophic archaea that oxidize ammonia (a nitrogen-containing compound) for energy instead of using sunlight.\n\nHowever, when researchers examined the nitrogen-based energy budget of these carbon-fixing microbes by sampling the water column, they soon realized that the math did not work out.\n\n\"There was a discrepancy between what people would measure when they went out on a ship to measure carbon fixation and what was understood to be the energy sources for microbes,\" Santoro said. \"We basically couldn't get the budget to work out for the organisms that are fixing carbon.\" The microbes require energy to fix carbon, she explained, but there did not appear to be enough nitrogen-derived energy in the deep ocean to support the high carbon fixation rates that were being reported throughout the water column.\n\nA decade-long carbon cycle mystery\n\nThis mismatch has occupied the attention of Santoro and the paper's lead author Barbara Bayer for nearly ten years as they have sought to close a key gap in our understanding of the ocean's carbon cycle. Earlier studies tested the idea that perhaps the carbon-fixing archaea were far more efficient than scientists assumed, needing less nitrogen to fix the same amount of carbon. Their work, however, showed that this explanation did not hold up.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers shifted their focus and asked a different question: How much do these ammonia oxidizers actually contribute to the overall dissolved inorganic carbon fixation in the dark ocean? To answer that, Bayer designed a targeted experiment.\n\n\"She came up with a way to specifically inhibit their activity in the deep ocean,\" Santoro explained. By limiting the activity of these oxidizers with a specialized chemical, the team expected to see a sharp drop in carbon fixation. The inhibitor, phenylacetylene, was confirmed to have no other measurable effects on other community processes.\n\nTheir results indicated that despite inhibiting these ammonia oxidizers -- mostly archaea that are abundant in the dark ocean -- the rate of carbon fixation in the study areas didn't drop as much as expected.\n\nNew suspects in deep-sea carbon fixation\n\nIf ammonia-oxidizing archaea are not responsible for as much carbon fixation as once believed, other microbes must be stepping in. The pool of likely contributors now includes additional types of microbes in the surrounding community, particularly bacteria and some archaea.\n\n\"We think that what this means is that the heterotrophs -- microorganisms that feed on organic carbon from decomposing microbes and other marine life -- are taking up a lot of inorganic carbon in addition to the organic carbon that they usually consume,\" Santoro said, \"meaning that they're also responsible for fixing some carbon dioxide.\n\n\"And that's really interesting because even though we know this to be a theoretical possibility, we didn't really have a quantitative number on what fraction of the carbon in the deep ocean was getting fixed by these heterotrophs versus autotrophs. And now we do.\"\n\nRethinking the deep-ocean food web\n\nThe new findings do more than clarify who is fixing carbon at depth. They also provide fresh insight into how the deep ocean's food web is structured and sustained.\n\n\"There are basic aspects of how the food web works in the deep ocean that we don't understand,\" Santoro said, \"and I think of this as figuring out how the very base of the food web in the deep ocean works.\"\n\nMore mysteries of the deep\n\nFurther work in this realm for Santoro and her collaborators will dive into the finer aspects of carbon fixation in the ocean, such as how the nitrogen cycle and carbon cycle interact with other elemental cycles in the ocean, including for iron and copper.\n\n\"The other thing we're trying to figure out is once these organisms fix the carbon into their cells, how does it become available to the rest of the food web?\" she noted. \"What kinds of organic compounds might they be leaking out of their cells that could be feeding the rest of the food web with?\"\n\nResearch in this paper was also conducted by Nicola L. Paul, Justine B. Albers and Craig A. Carlson at UCSB; Katharina Kitzinger and Michael Wagner at the University of Vienna as well as Mak A. Saito at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",

      "content": "The scale of agriculture’s environmental impact is staggering. According to the EPA, agricultural runoff is the leading cause of degraded water quality in rivers and streams. Today’s farming practices lead to 1.70 billion tons of U.S. topsoil annually, and agriculture produces 31% of human greenhouse gas emissions. Tune in to meet Kelsey Timmerman, author of the new book, Regenerating Earth, from Patagonia Books, who faces a heartbreaking reality shared by many rural families: he can’t let his children swim in the pond near their Indiana home because of agricultural contamination. Rather than accept environmental degradation as inevitable, Kelsey embarked on a global journey to find farmers and communities who prove there’s another way. From standing barefoot in traditional Hawaiian kalo patches to protecting cattle from lions alongside Maasai warriors in Kenya to discovering how chocolate could save Brazilian rainforests, he found regenerative agriculture practices that build soil, sequester carbon, and challenge everything we think we know about farming.\n\nKelsey’s story revolves around systems thinking that connects everything from chloroplasts to mycorrhizal fungi with how we eat. He argues that industrial agriculture leads to farmers being farmed by corporations, trapping them in debt to buy chemically treated seeds, fertilizer, herbicides, and fungicides. His journey uncovered regenerative practices rooted in Indigenous and traditional farming practices combined with cutting-edge soil science. Farming can be more profitable for farmers who heal the land. The solutions aren’t new. They’re already in hand but largely ignored or forgotten because they require attention to nature’s complexity rather than simplifying life to fit profit margins. Regenerative thinking starts by approaching problems through the same lens that nature does, by putting everything to use and accounting for all positive and negative impacts while treating nothing as waste to be discarded. For consumers, this means understanding that grocery choices ripple through complex ecological networks, with practical steps starting at farmers markets and supporting farms that regenerate rather than degrade the land which you can find using the Farm Map at https://regenerationinternational.org/.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Agriculture has a big impact on the environment. It causes water pollution, soil loss, and makes up nearly a third of greenhouse gas emissions. Many farming methods today harm the land and water.\n\n**What happened** – Kelsey Timmerman, an author, traveled around the world to find farms using regenerative agriculture. These farms use traditional and nature-based methods to improve soil health and capture carbon. He visited places like Hawaii, Kenya, and Brazil to see how these farming practices work and meet the people behind them.\n\n**Impact** – Timmerman’s journey shows that farming doesn’t have to damage the environment. Regenerative farming helps the land heal, supports farmers financially, and reduces pollution. This approach connects nature’s processes with how we grow food, offering a better way than industrial farming.\n\n**What’s next step** – People can support these farms by choosing food from places that use regenerative methods. Tools like the Farm Map from Regeneration International help consumers find such farms. Timmerman’s book, Regenerating Earth, shares more stories and ideas to inspire change.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Regenerative agriculture offers proven ways to farm that restore the Earth while supporting farmers and communities.\n",
