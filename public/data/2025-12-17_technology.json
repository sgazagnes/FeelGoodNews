      "title": "Ramanujan’s 100-year-old pi formula is still revealing the Universe",
      "summary": "Ramanujan’s elegant formulas for calculating pi, developed more than a century ago, have unexpectedly resurfaced at the heart of modern physics. Researchers at IISc discovered that the same mathematical structures behind these formulas also describe real-world phenomena like turbulence, percolation, and even black holes. What once seemed like pure mathematics now appears deeply intertwined with the physical laws governing the universe.",
      "content": "Most people first encounter the irrational number π (pi) -- commonly approximated as 3.14 and extending infinitely without repeating -- during school lessons about circles. In recent decades, advances in computing have pushed this familiar constant far beyond the classroom, with powerful supercomputers now calculating pi to trillions of decimal places.\n\nResearchers have now uncovered an unexpected twist. Physicists at the Centre for High Energy Physics (CHEP), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) report that mathematical formulas developed a century ago to compute pi are closely linked to some of today's most important ideas in fundamental physics. These connections appear in theoretical descriptions of percolation, fluid turbulence, and even certain features of black holes.\n\nRamanujan's Remarkable Pi Formulae\n\nIn 1914, shortly before leaving Madras for Cambridge, renowned Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan published a paper presenting 17 different formulas for calculating pi. These expressions were strikingly efficient, allowing pi to be computed much faster than existing techniques of the time. Despite containing only a small number of mathematical terms, the formulas produced an impressive number of accurate digits.\n\nTheir impact has endured. Ramanujan's methods became foundational to modern mathematical and computational approaches for calculating pi, including those used by today's most advanced machines. \"Scientists have computed pi up to 200 trillion digits using an algorithm called the Chudnovsky algorithm,\" says Aninda Sinha, Professor at CHEP and senior author of the study. \"These algorithms are actually based on Ramanujan's work.\"\n\nA Deeper Question Behind the Mathematics\n\nFor Sinha and Faizan Bhat, the study's first author and a former IISc PhD student, the mystery went beyond computational efficiency. They asked why such powerful formulas should exist in the first place. Rather than treating them as purely abstract results, the team searched for an explanation rooted in physics.\n\n\"We wanted to see whether the starting point of his formulae fit naturally into some physics,\" says Sinha. \"In other words, is there a physical world where Ramanujan's mathematics appears on its own?\"\n\nWhere Pi Meets Scale Invariance and Physics Extremes\n\nTheir investigation led them to a broad family of theories known as conformal field theories, and more specifically to logarithmic conformal field theories. These theories describe systems that exhibit scale invariance symmetry -- meaning they look the same regardless of how closely they are examined, similar to fractals.\n\nA familiar physical example appears at the critical point of water, defined by a precise temperature and pressure at which liquid water and water vapor become indistinguishable. At this point, water displays scale invariance symmetry, and its behavior can be captured using conformal field theory. Similar critical behavior arises in percolation (how substances spread through a material), during the onset of turbulence in fluids, and in certain theoretical treatments of black holes. These phenomena fall within the domain of logarithmic conformal field theories.\n\nUsing Ramanujan's Structure to Solve Physics Problems\n\nThe researchers discovered that the mathematical framework at the heart of Ramanujan's pi formulas also appears in the equations underlying these logarithmic conformal field theories. By exploiting this shared structure, they were able to compute key quantities within the theories more efficiently. Such calculations could ultimately improve scientists' understanding of complex processes like turbulence and percolation.\n\nThe approach mirrors Ramanujan's own method of starting from a compact mathematical expression and rapidly arriving at precise results for pi. \"[In] any piece of beautiful mathematics, you almost always find that there is a physical system which actually mirrors the mathematics,\" says Bhat. \"Ramanujan's motivation might have been very mathematical, but without his knowledge, he was also studying black holes, turbulence, percolation, all sorts of things.\"\n\nA Century-Old Insight With Modern Impact\n\nThe findings reveal that Ramanujan's formulas, developed more than 100 years ago, offer a previously hidden advantage for making modern high-energy physics calculations faster and more manageable. Beyond their practical value, the researchers say the work highlights the extraordinary reach of Ramanujan's ideas.\n\n\"We were simply fascinated by the way a genius working in early 20th century India, with almost no contact with modern physics, anticipated structures that are now central to our understanding of the universe,\" says Sinha.",

      "title": "This rare earthquake did everything scientists hoped to see",
      "summary": "A rare, ultra-long earthquake in Myanmar revealed that mature faults can deliver their full force directly to the surface. The discovery could mean stronger shaking near faults like California’s San Andreas than current models predict.",
      "content": "The powerful earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28, 2025, has given researchers an uncommon chance to observe how some of the planet's most dangerous fault systems behave, including faults similar to California's San Andreas. Earthquakes are usually chaotic and difficult to study, but this one occurred along an unusually straight and geologically \"mature\" fault, creating nearly ideal conditions to examine how energy is released during a major continental rupture.\n\nScientists have long struggled to observe earthquakes that behave in such a clean and predictable way. The Myanmar event stood out because its fault geometry removed many of the complications that typically obscure how seismic energy moves through the Earth.\n\nInvestigating the Longstanding Shallow Slip Deficit Mystery\n\nAn international research team led by The University of New Mexico focused on understanding how mature faults behave during large earthquakes, with special attention on a debated phenomenon called the \"shallow slip deficit.\" In many earthquakes, surface movement is far smaller than the motion that occurs deep underground. This gap has raised questions about whether some of the energy is absorbed by surrounding rock or simply goes undetected.\n\nBy closely analyzing the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, the researchers aimed to determine how energy moves along an ancient, relatively simple fault system and whether deep motion is fully transferred to the surface.\n\nThe study, titled \"Mature fault mechanics revealed by the highly efficient 2025 Mandalay earthquake,\" was published in Nature Communications. It was led by UNM Assistant Professor Eric Lindsey, working alongside collaborators from Taiwan and Myanmar.\n\nStudying a Major Earthquake From Space\n\nBecause Myanmar is currently affected by armed conflict and the earthquake caused further damage to infrastructure, researchers were unable to quickly conduct on-the-ground investigations. Instead, they turned to satellite-based observations to collect the data needed for their analysis.\n\n\"We used two primary satellite technologies: Optical Image Correlation (using Sentinel-2 satellites) to track how pixels in satellite photos moved between two images collected before and after the quake, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) using Sentinel-1 satellites, which measures the change in distance to the ground from the satellite between two consecutive passes. These tools allowed us to measure ground shifts with incredible precision without setting foot in the danger zone,\" explained Lindsey.\n\nHow InSAR Reveals Ground Movement in Extreme Detail\n\nInSAR functions like a sophisticated version of \"spot the difference,\" using radar signals to detect extremely small changes in the Earth's surface from orbit. As a satellite circles the planet, it sends radar waves toward the ground and records the returning signals.\n\n\"By comparing the time it takes for the signal to bounce back to the satellite from each point on the ground, we can detect changes in the ground's elevation or position down to a fraction of an inch. It allows us to map exactly how the Earth warped over an area hundreds of miles wide, day or night, and through clouds,\" Lindsey said.\n\nThis approach allowed the team to reconstruct the earthquake's impact across an enormous region with remarkable accuracy.\n\nA 500-Kilometer Rupture Unlike Most Earthquakes\n\nThe rupture caused by the Myanmar earthquake extended for nearly 500 kilometers. To visualize that scale, it is similar to a crack stretching from Albuquerque to Denver, with the ground on either side suddenly sliding past each other by 10 to 15 feet.\n\n\"Most earthquakes we study break much shorter fault segments -- perhaps 30 to 60 miles long. It is incredibly rare and scientifically significant to see a rupture that is this long, continuous, and straight,\" Lindsey said.\n\nSuch a long, uninterrupted rupture provided scientists with an exceptional natural experiment.\n\nA Fault System Comparable to California's San Andreas\n\nThe earthquake occurred along the Sagaing Fault, which is a strike-slip fault. In this type of fault, the two sides move horizontally past one another, similar to cars scraping by each other on a highway.\n\n\"This is just like the San Andreas fault in California,\" Lindsey said. \"We also describe the Sagaing fault as 'mature,' which means it has been slipping in the same way for millions of years. Over that vast time, the rough edges and bends in the fault have been ground down. Because it is so smooth and straight, the earthquake rupture could travel very efficiently across a huge distance.\"\n\nThis long history of motion has shaped the fault into a structure that allows seismic energy to move with little resistance.\n\nNo Missing Energy at the Surface\n\nFor decades, researchers have observed that many earthquakes show far less movement at the surface than deep underground, a phenomenon known as the \"Shallow Slip Deficit.\"\n\n\"We found that in the 2025 Mandalay earthquake, this deficit was non-existent. The massive amount of slip that happened miles underground was transferred 100% to the surface,\" Lindsey explained.\n\nThis result contrasts sharply with many recent earthquakes where surface motion was reduced because energy was spread across networks of small fractures rather than concentrated on a single fault.\n\n\"This shows that on mature, smooth faults, the energy is highly focused and comes right to the surface,\" Lindsey said. \"This is significant because it means the ground shaking near the fault line might be more intense than our current hazard models predict for these types of faults.\"\n\nHow One Earthquake Linked Multiple Fault Segments\n\nThe research also revealed that the rupture was able to connect several fault sections into one continuous 500-km event, passing through boundaries that scientists previously believed might halt an earthquake.\n\n\"We found that the fault followed a historical pattern: it slipped less in areas that had experienced earthquakes in the 20th century and slipped the most in areas that hadn't broken since the 1800s,\" Lindsey said. This behavior is known as \"slip predictability\" and suggests scientists may be able to estimate how much movement could occur on fault segments that have not yet ruptured.\n\nSuch insights could improve long-term earthquake forecasting and preparedness efforts.\n\nWhy Satellite Science Matters for Global Safety\n\nThe study demonstrates the growing power of satellite-based observation. Even in a conflict zone where traditional fieldwork was not possible, researchers were able to produce one of the most detailed analyses of earthquake mechanics to date.\n\n\"It's a testament to how global scientific collaboration and open data access (like the Copernicus Sentinel missions) can help us understand natural hazards that affect millions of people,\" Lindsey said. \"The significance lies in safety. This earthquake showed us that mature faults can be much more efficient at transmitting energy to the surface than younger ones, which has direct implications for how we build infrastructure to withstand the 'Big One' in the United States.\"\n\nApplying These Methods Closer to Home\n\nLindsey noted that New Mexico sits on a very different fault system known as the Rio Grande Rift, which is pulling apart inside of sliding sideways.\n\n\"The remote sensing techniques we refined in this paper are the exact same methods we can use to monitor safety issues close to home,\" he explained.\n\nBy using InSAR to track land subsidence caused by aquifer depletion in New Mexico, as well as slow ground movement related to the rift and deep magma body inflation beneath Socorro, researchers can help state officials better plan for future risks.\n\n\"Understanding the physics of 'mature' faults helps us understand the general mechanics of the earth's crust, which improves earthquake hazard models globally,\" Lindsey concluded.",

By using atoms that emit light cooperatively between mirrors, acceleration subtly shifts when a powerful light burst appears. That early flash acts like a timestamped signature of the effect. The method could make once-theoretical physics experimentally reachable.",
      "content": "Scientists at Stockholm University and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali have outlined a realistic strategy to observe one of the most unusual ideas in modern physics: the Unruh effect. This effect predicts that an object that is speeding up (accelerating) would experience empty space as slightly warm. In practice, however, producing enough acceleration to directly heat something is far beyond what laboratory experiments can achieve. The researchers instead describe how this extremely weak effect could be transformed into a distinct, precisely timed burst of light.\n\nThe basic setup is easier to picture than the underlying physics. Consider a collection of atoms placed between two parallel mirrors. These mirrors can influence how quickly the atoms release light. Under the right conditions, the atoms stop acting independently and instead emit light together, like a choir singing in unison -- much louder than solo singers. This phenomenon is known as superradiance.\n\nAccording to the new work, if the atoms experience the subtle warmth associated with the Unruh effect, that influence gently shifts their behavior. The result is that the collective flash of light occurs slightly earlier than it would if the atoms were not accelerating. This advance in timing becomes a clear and measurable sign of the Unruh effect.\n\nTurning a Whisper Into a Clear Signal\n\n\"We've found a way to turn the Unruh effect's whisper into a shout,\" said Akhil Deswal, a PhD student at IISER Mohali. \"By using carefully spaced high-quality mirrors, we make ordinary background signals quieter while the acceleration-seeded burst comes out early and clean.\"\n\nAn important advantage of this approach is that it dramatically reduces how much acceleration is needed. Without high-quality mirrors, the required acceleration would be far greater and well beyond practical limits.\n\nWhy Timing Makes the Difference\n\n\"Timing is the key,\" added Navdeep Arya, a postdoctoral researcher at Stockholm University. \"The choir of atoms is not only louder but also shouts earlier if they feel the faint Unruh effect-related warmth of empty space. That simple clock-like marker can make it easier to separate the Unruh signal from everyday noise.\"\n\nBy focusing on when the light appears rather than how intense it is, the method offers a new way to isolate the desired signal from background effects that normally overwhelm it.\n\nConnecting Laboratory Experiments to Extreme Physics\n\nBy tackling a detection problem that has challenged physicists for decades, the proposal helps narrow the gap between standard laboratory equipment and phenomena usually associated with extreme environments. Since acceleration and gravity are closely linked, similar timing-based methods could eventually allow scientists to study delicate quantum effects driven by gravity -- right on the lab bench.\n\nThe research, co-authored with Kinjalk Lochan and Sandeep K. Goyal of IISER Mohali, has been published in Physical Review Letters.",

El tiempo del destello de luz es más fácil de medir que la intensidad de la luz, ayudando a los científicos a notar el efecto incluso con ruido alrededor.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos ahora pueden intentar probar este método en el laboratorio para ver el efecto Unruh por primera vez. Esto podría abrir la puerta a estudiar otras ideas difíciles de física relacionadas con la aceleración y la gravedad usando equipos comunes.\n\n**Una frase clave** – Un uso inteligente de átomos y espejos puede permitir que los científicos finalmente observen el pequeño calor que sienten los objetos que aceleran en el espacio vacío, haciendo que un efecto teórico sea medible en el laboratorio.",

      "content": "How will artificial intelligence reshape the global economy? Some economists predict only a small boost — around a 0.9% increase in gross domestic product over the next ten years1. Others foresee a revolution that might add between US$17 trillion and $26 trillion to annual global economic output and automate up to half of today’s jobs by 20452. But even before the full impacts materialize, beliefs about our AI future affect the economy today — steering young people’s career choices, guiding government policy and driving vast investment flows into semiconductors and other components of data centres.\n\nWhy evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now\n\nGiven the high stakes, many researchers and policymakers are increasingly attempting to precisely quantify the causal impact of AI through natural experiments and randomized controlled trials. In such studies, one group gains access to an AI tool while another continues under normal conditions; other factors are held fixed. Researchers can then analyse outcomes such as productivity, satisfaction and learning.\n\nYet, when applied to AI, this type of evidence faces two challenges. First, by the time they are published, causal estimates of AI’s effects can be outdated. For instance, one study found that call-centre workers handled queries 15% faster when using 2020 AI tools3. Another showed that software developers with access to coding assistants in 2022–23 completed 26% more tasks than did those without such tools4. But AI capabilities are advancing at an astounding pace. For example, since ChatGPT’s release in 2022, AI tools can now correctly handle three times as many simulated customer-support chats on their own as they could before5. The better, cheaper AI of tomorrow will produce different economic effects.\n\nSecond, carefully controlled studies do not capture the wider ripple effects that accompany AI adoption. For example, the studies involving call-centre workers3 and software developers4 found that when organizational structure remained fixed, the less-experienced workers benefited most from AI assistance. But in the real world, managers might respond by reorganizing work or even replacing some of the less-experienced workers with AI systems. If they do, the effect on those individuals could be the opposite of that estimated in controlled studies. Indeed, payroll data suggest that employment of younger workers has declined since 2022, particularly in occupations that include tasks that AI excels at, such as customer service and software development6. However, researchers are still trying to understand how much of the pattern is attributable to AI technology.\n\nCarefully controlled studies are like flashing a bright, narrow spotlight: they are only part of the illumination needed to understand how society is adapting to AI. With so much still unknown about its broader economic and social effects, popular debate often slips into speculative, science-fiction narratives of a world dominated by machine intelligence.\n\nSocial science could help to navigate these uncertainties, but it would require both imagination and grounding. Here, I describe three complementary approaches that can guide researchers working in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nSocial science fiction\n\nOne approach is to create what economist Jean Tirole calls social science fiction7 — speculation about the future that remains rooted in fundamental economic principles and behavioural theories. Rather than relying on imagination alone, this kind of analysis uses models to explore how technologies might interact with market forces.\n\nFor example, in 2019, researchers modelled how self-driving cars might reshape cities and found that the vehicles could make traffic worse8. Because passengers in self-driving cars can relax, read or watch videos, the personal cost of time spent in traffic falls. But as more people choose to travel by car, they impose greater congestion on others. Whether that leads to inefficiency will depend on whether governments implement policies such as congestion pricing to correct the ‘externality’.\n\nCan AI help beat poverty? Researchers test ways to aid the poorest people\n\nAnother illustration of imaginative, yet grounded, social science comes from research on how market forces might limit AI’s disruptive potential. Studies9,10 suggest that, as automation boosts productivity in some tasks, other activities that cannot easily be automated — such as creative direction or vetting final outputs — will grow in relative value. That might raise demand for labour, and therefore wages, in such jobs. These opportunities could cushion some of the disruptive effects of automation. But it might also deepen inequalities between people who thrive in these roles and those who do not.\n\nMore thought experiments like these can help policymakers to imagine how the economy might shift in a more disciplined manner. Such experiments can identify which indicators to monitor and provide a head start on planning the policies that might be needed. Other open problems include understanding the incentives to create knowledge for AI systems, and how innovation and economic growth might be affected if AI labs remain competitive with each other, or if one pulls ahead as a clear market leader.\n\nForward-looking data\n\nAs well as theory, policymakers will also need evidence to understand how the economy will change. Different types of information need to combine to form a more complete picture.\n\nOne common approach to assessing AI capabilities is benchmarking — testing the systems on standardized tasks, much as exams do. Benchmarks can assess an AI system’s ability to solve mathematics problems, respond to customer-support requests or diagnose medical conditions. However, benchmark scores often diverge from performance in real-world settings, where tasks are noisier, more complex and context-dependent. For example, a medical AI system might perform well on textbook-style clinical questions, but could misinterpret communications from patients if they omit key details. More research is needed to design benchmarks that better capture real-world performance.\n\nIf AI is anywhere near as transformative as many expect, its effects will show up in numerous indicators that can be monitored in real time, such as tracking which tasks people use AI for. These usage data show, for instance, that AI chatbots are often used for software development, suggesting that this sector might feel the earliest effects of AI adoption11,12. Other indicators include employment, job openings and whether firms that integrate AI earn higher profits and expand. However, there will be questions that such descriptive indicators alone cannot answer. For that reason, researchers might still attempt to measure the causal impact of AI: that is, whether AI causes improvements, rather than merely being adopted by high performers who also happen to be more willing to try new technologies.\n\nAI can supercharge inequality — unless the public learns to control it\n\nEstimating AI’s causal effects is difficult because the technology is evolving and organizations are adapting. But this challenge is not unique to AI. Similar issues arise when evaluating how any pilot programme — whether in business, education or public health — will perform once it is expanded. When scaled up, programmes often encounter fresh constraints or trigger wider economic fallouts. Economists have developed methods to anticipate these scaling effects when designing experiments, such as replicating the conditions of the eventual implementer — for example, a government agency — rather than those of the more agile, well-resourced organizations that typically run pilots13–15. Researchers studying AI can similarly attempt to anticipate future changes when designing experiments.\n\nOne important parameter is the cost of running AI models, which has been falling. Researchers can model how cost declines might affect the viability of different applications. For example, one study16 examined AI usage by teachers in Sierra Leone who pay for Internet access by the megabyte. In early 2022, querying an AI chatbot was 12 times more expensive than loading a standard web page; by 2025, thanks to falling compute costs and the bandwidth efficiency of AI, using the technology had become 98% cheaper than accessing a web page. This cost advantage suggests that AI might expand access to information in low-resource settings where the Internet is expensive.\n\nThe capabilities of AI are another crucial determinant of its impact. It is hard to predict how these will evolve, but researchers can try to anticipate how humans might respond to more-powerful systems. Even as technology advances, human behaviour tends to follow stable patterns — in terms of how people develop trust, how they respond to incentives and how they adapt to automation.",

      "personality_title": "New approaches help us understand AI’s fast-changing impact on the economy",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how the world’s economy works, but experts disagree on how big this change will be. Some say AI will only slightly increase economic growth, while others predict it could add trillions of dollars and change many jobs by 2045. Because AI is developing so quickly, it’s hard to measure its full effects right now.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers have been using special studies where some people get AI tools and others don’t, to see how AI affects work and productivity. These studies show AI can help workers do tasks faster and better. But they don’t capture bigger effects, like companies changing how they organize work or replacing some jobs with AI. Also, AI is improving so fast that studies can quickly become outdated. To understand AI’s real impact, economists suggest working with social scientists to imagine different futures based on economic rules and human behavior.\n\n**Impact** – This combined approach helps us think more clearly about how AI might change jobs, cities, and wages, instead of guessing wildly. For example, AI might increase demand for creative jobs that machines cannot do well, but could also widen wage gaps. Falling costs of AI tools mean more people, even in poor countries, can access information and services. This shows AI’s potential to help many people, but also highlights the need to watch carefully how society adapts.\n\n**What’s next step** – Researchers will develop better ways to track AI’s effects in real life, using new kinds of data and improved tests that work outside the lab. They will also create models to predict how AI and humans might work together in the future. Policymakers can use this information to prepare for changes in jobs, education, and economic fairness. Understanding AI’s impact will be an ongoing process as the technology keeps evolving.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Combining data and imagination helps experts better understand how rapidly advancing AI will shape the economy and society over the coming years.",

La rapidité des progrès rend difficile la mesure complète de ses effets.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs ont mené des études où certains utilisateurs disposent d’outils IA tandis que d’autres non, pour observer l’impact sur le travail et la productivité. Ces études montrent que l’IA aide les travailleurs à accomplir les tâches plus rapidement et mieux. Mais elles ne captent pas les effets plus larges, comme la réorganisation des entreprises ou le remplacement de certains emplois par l’IA. De plus, l’IA évolue si vite que les résultats deviennent vite obsolètes. Pour mieux comprendre, les économistes proposent de collaborer avec les sciences sociales pour imaginer des futurs basés sur des règles économiques et le comportement humain.\n\n**Impact** – Cette approche combinée permet de réfléchir plus clairement à la manière dont l’IA pourrait changer les emplois, les villes et les salaires, plutôt que de faire des suppositions. Par exemple, l’IA pourrait augmenter la demande pour des emplois créatifs difficiles à automatiser, mais aussi creuser les écarts de revenus. La baisse des coûts des outils IA signifie que davantage de personnes, même dans les pays pauvres, peuvent accéder à l’information et aux services. Cela montre le potentiel positif de l’IA, tout en soulignant la nécessité de surveiller l’adaptation de la société.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs vont développer de meilleures méthodes pour suivre les effets de l’IA dans la vie réelle, en utilisant de nouvelles données et des tests améliorés hors laboratoire. Ils créeront aussi des modèles pour prédire comment humains et IA pourraient collaborer à l’avenir. Les décideurs pourront ainsi mieux préparer les changements dans l’emploi, l’éducation et l’équité économique. Comprendre l’impact de l’IA sera un processus continu à mesure que la technologie évolue.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Allier données et imagination aide les experts à mieux comprendre comment l’IA en rapide évolution façonnera l’économie et la société dans les années à venir.",
