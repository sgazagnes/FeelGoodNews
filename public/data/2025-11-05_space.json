      "title": "New evidence suggests Einstein’s cosmic constant may be wrong",
      "summary": "Astronomers are rethinking one of cosmology’s biggest mysteries: dark energy. New findings show that evolving dark energy models, tied to ultra-light axion particles, may better fit the universe’s expansion history than Einstein’s constant model. The results suggest dark energy’s density could be slowly declining, altering the fate of the cosmos and fueling excitement that we may be witnessing the universe’s next great revelation.",
      "content": "Dark energy, the mysterious force thought to drive the universe's accelerating expansion, remains one of the deepest puzzles in modern physics. For years, the leading explanation has been that this energy is constant -- an unchanging property of empty space responsible for cosmic acceleration. But recent evidence has scientists rethinking that assumption.\n\nLast year, results from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) caught the attention of cosmologists by suggesting that dark energy might not be fixed after all. \"This would be our first indication that dark energy is not the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein over 100 years ago but a new, dynamical phenomenon,\" explained Josh Frieman, Professor Emeritus of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nNew Analysis Points to an Evolving Force\n\nIn a study published in Physical Review D in September, Frieman and Anowar Shajib, a NASA Hubble Fellowship Program Einstein Fellow in Astronomy and Astrophysics, analyzed a broad range of existing cosmological data. Their findings indicate that dynamic, time-varying models of dark energy provide a better fit to current observations than the long-standing cosmological constant model.\n\nShajib specializes in observational cosmology and galaxy evolution, applying strong gravitational lensing to measure the Hubble constant and narrow down dark energy parameters. Frieman's work also centers on observational cosmology, making use of massive sky surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the DES to study the universe's origin, structure, and fate while probing the mysterious force driving its accelerated expansion.\n\nThe University of Chicago spoke with Shajib and Frieman about their findings, what these new models could mean for our understanding of cosmic evolution, and how future observations might reveal whether dark energy truly changes over time.\n\nWhy is dark energy significant in the study of the universe?\n\nFrieman: We now know precisely how much dark energy there is in the universe, but we have no physical understanding of what it is. The simplest hypothesis is that it is the energy of empty space itself, in which case it would be unchanging in time, a notion that goes back to Einstein, Lemaitre, de Sitter, and others in the early part of the last century. It's a bit embarrassing that we have little to no clue what 70 percent of the universe is. And whatever it is, it will determine the future evolution of the universe.\n\nWhat recent findings led cosmologists to consider that dark energy may be evolving?\n\nShajib: Although there has been interest in the dynamical nature of dark energy since its discovery in the '90s to resolve some observational discrepancies, until recently, most of the major and robust datasets were consistent with a non-evolving dark energy model, which is accepted as the standard cosmology. However, interest in evolving dark energy was vigorously rekindled last year from the combination of supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation, and cosmic microwave background data from the DES, DESI, and Planck experiments. This combination of datasets indicated a strong discrepancy with the standard, non-evolving model of dark energy. The interesting feature of non-evolving dark energy is that its density stays constant through time even though space is expanding. However, for the evolving dark energy model, dark energy density will change with time.\n\nFrieman: The data from these surveys allow us to infer the history of cosmic expansion -- how fast the universe has been expanding at different epochs in the past. If dark energy evolves in time, that history will be different than if dark energy is constant. The cosmic expansion history results suggest that over the last several billion years or so, the density of dark energy has decreased by about 10 percent -- not much, and much less than the densities of other matter and energy, but still significant.\n\nWhat was the goal of this study, and what were the overall findings?\n\nShajib and Frieman: The goal of this study is to compare the predictions of a physical model for evolving dark energy with the latest data sets and to infer the physical properties of dark energy from this comparison. The evolving dark energy \"model\" used in most previous data analyses is just a mathematical formula that isn't constrained to behave as physical models do. In our paper, we directly compare physics-based models for evolving dark energy to the data and find that these models describe the current data better than the standard, non-evolving dark energy model. We also show that near-future surveys such as DESI and the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will be able to definitively tell us whether these models are correct or if, instead, dark energy really is constant.\n\nDescribe the models presented and why they better explain the behavior of dark energy compared to existing models.\n\nFrieman: These models are based on particle physics theories of hypothetical particles called axions. Axions were first predicted by physicists in the 1970s, who sought to explain certain observed features of strong interactions. Today, axions are considered plausible candidates for dark matter, and experiments worldwide are actively searching for them, including physicists at Fermilab and the University of Chicago.\n\nThe models in our paper are based on a different, ultra-light version of the axion that would act as dark energy, not dark matter. In these models, dark energy would, in fact, be constant for the first several billion years of cosmic history, but the axion would then start to evolve -- like a ball on a sloping field that's released from rest and starts to roll -- and its density would slowly decrease, which is what the data appear to prefer. So the data suggest the existence of a new particle in nature that's about 38 orders of magnitude lighter than the electron.\n\nWhat are the implications of these findings for understanding cosmic expansion?\n\nShajib: In these models, the dark energy density decreases with time. Dark energy is the reason for the universe's accelerated expansion, so if its density decreases, the acceleration will also decrease with time. If we consider the very far future of the universe, different characteristics of dark energy can lead to different outcomes. Two extremes of these outcomes are a Big Rip, where the accelerated expansion itself accelerates to the point that it rips everything apart, even atoms, and a Big Crunch, where the universe stops expanding at some point and recollapses, which will look like a reverse Big Bang. Our models suggest that the universe will avoid both of these extremes: it will undergo accelerated expansion for many billions of years, yielding a cold, dark universe -- a Big Freeze.\n\nCould these results have other, less apparent implications?\n\nFrieman: The only practical implications I can imagine are the technologies we need to develop to explore these ideas further -- building new telescopes, launching new satellites, or developing novel detectors, for example. Such developments are likely to have much more of an impact on our lives than events happening trillions of years in the future.\n\nWhat excites you the most about these results?\n\nShajib: For this paper, we gathered all the major data sets -- from the DES, DESI, SDSS, Time-Delay COSMOgraphy, Planck, and Atacama Cosmology Telescope -- and combined them to get the most constraining measurement of dark energy to date. All these measurements come from extensive experiments, so in a way, they represent the collective knowledge that the cosmological community has gathered as a whole.\n\nFrieman: When we began working on the DES in 2003, our goal was to constrain the properties of dark energy to determine whether it was constant or changing. For two decades, the data indicated that it was constant. We almost gave up on that question because the data consistently supported the assumption. However, we now have the first hint in over 20 years that dark energy might be changing, and if it is evolving, it must be something new, which would change our understanding of fundamental physics. That feeling is reminiscent of where we were at the beginning. It could still turn out that these hints are incorrect, but we may be on the cusp of answering that question, and that's quite exciting.",

      "title": "Brightest black hole flare ever caused by huge star being ripped apart",
      "summary": "A distant black hole has been caught releasing the brightest flare ever, which is the result of it ripping apart and devouring an enormous star",
      "content": "A distant black hole has been caught releasing the brightest flare ever, which is the result of it ripping apart and devouring an enormous star\n\nA supermassive black hole in the process of shredding an enormous star Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC)\n\nAstronomers have spotted the brightest flare we have ever seen coming from a supermassive black hole. The flare was so powerful it can only have come from a huge star being ripped apart at the centre of a distant galaxy in what is called a tidal disruption event (TDE), releasing an extraordinary burst of energy that still hasn’t completely faded.\n\nThe flare came from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) – a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy that is actively consuming matter – nearly 20 billion light years away, making it one of the most distant TDEs ever detected. In fact, we haven’t discovered many of these tidal disruption events in AGNs at all, because the intrinsic changes in brightness near active black holes make it difficult to tell if a flare is a TDE, or something else.\n\n“We’ve known what AGNs are for about 60 years, and we knew that they were very variable, but we didn’t understand the variability,” says Matthew Graham at the California Institute of Technology. “Now we have millions of AGN and we still don’t understand the variability.” This event, nicknamed “Superman” for its incredible brightness and power, could help demystify these cosmic objects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuperman was first spotted in 2018, but with no way of measuring its distance from Earth, astronomers assumed it was simply a bright but not unexpected burst from a relatively nearby galaxy. It wasn’t until 2023 that follow-up observations revealed the flare was much more distant, making its intrinsic brightness far higher than researchers initially thought.\n\nThe initial flare brightened the AGN by more than a factor of 40, making it 30 times as powerful as the previous strongest flare ever seen from an AGN. Graham and his colleagues found the most likely cause by far was a massive star being ripped apart: one at least 30 times the mass of the sun, but possibly much bigger.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nIn the area around every active supermassive black hole is a ring of material in the process of falling in, called an accretion disc. The density of material in that area should produce huge stars, but we have never seen them directly. “If our interpretation is correct that this is a TDE, then it is proving the existence of these massive stars in that environment, which we have suspected,” says Graham.\n\n“We used to think that an active supermassive black hole would just have its disc of gas and it would sit there and burble along. But it’s a much more vibrant and dynamic environment,” he says. Studying Superman as it continues to fade could help us understand that environment more deeply.\n\nIt could also enable us to build a model of TDEs in AGNs that we could use to search for more. “Often if we see that a TDE appears to be in one of these AGN hosts, we don’t really know if this is just the active galactic nucleus acting up or if we really have a TDE, so it’s really great to have something that’s not ambiguous in that way,” says Vivienne Baldassare at Washington State University. “This will be really important for trying to find future TDEs and untangle different sources of variability in AGNs.”\n\nJournal reference The Astrophysical Journal Letters DOI: 10.3847/2041-8213/ae0b5e",

This flare, named \"Superman,\" was caused by a huge star—at least 30 times heavier than the sun—being ripped apart as it neared the black hole.
