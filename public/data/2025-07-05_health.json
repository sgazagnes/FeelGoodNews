      "title": "Parkinson’s reversal? One drug brings dying brain cells back to life",
      "content": "Stanford researchers discovered that dialing down an overactive enzyme, LRRK2, can regrow lost cellular “antennae” in key brain cells, restoring vital dopamine communication and neuroprotective signals in a mouse model of genetic Parkinson’s. After three months on the LRRK2-blocking drug MLi-2, damaged circuits revived and early signs of neuronal recovery emerged, hinting that timely treatment could not only halt but reverse disease progression—and perhaps benefit other Parkinson’s forms.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nParkinson’s disease slowly damages brain cells that control movement and mood, and so far, treatments mostly help manage symptoms but don’t fix the problem.\n\n**What happened**\nResearchers at Stanford found that blocking a specific enzyme called LRRK2 with a drug named MLi-2 helped damaged brain cells grow back their tiny antennae in mice.\n\n**Impact**\nThis regrowth revived important brain signals, showing signs that the brain circuits were healing, which means the drug might actually stop or even reverse Parkinson’s damage.\n\n**What’s next**\nScientists are hopeful this discovery will lead to new treatments for people with Parkinson’s, including those with different forms of the disease.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nA new drug has shown promising signs of reversing brain cell damage in Parkinson’s, offering fresh hope for patients and families.",
