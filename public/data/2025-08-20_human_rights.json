      "content": "Deborah Daley 00:06\n\nHello and welcome to Changemakers, a podcast series brought to you by Nature where we shine a light on fascinating and extraordinary scientists.\n\nI’m Deborah Daley, global chair of Springer Nature’s Black Employee Network. And I’m very proud to present this series where we explore exclusion in science and how some researchers are doing something about it.\n\nIn episode seven, we meet a Mexican American research leader who has turned mentoring into an evidence-based science.\n\nJoAnn Trejo 00:50\n\nHello. My name is JoAnn Trejo. I’m a professor at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nMy job, basically is as a teacher, mentor, and I also conduct biomedical research.\n\nThe goal of our work is to understand how to make cells that line blood vessels, called endothelial cells, resilient, so that they can resist injury and inflammation.\n\nThis work is actually quite important because it provides fundamental knowledge regarding how cell behaviour is controlled, but it’s also important because it helps us identify new proteins or targets that might be able to be used to develop drugs to treat vascular diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases.\n\nAnd cardiovascular disease is a disease that can lead to heart attacks and to strokes. And in the US, the United States, at least almost 1 million people a year lose their lives related to cardiovascular disease.\n\nAnd that’s sort of the greatest cause of death in the United States, and it’s greater than cancer and all other chronic diseases combined.\n\nI come from a very modest background, from a family of Mexican farm workers. My family immigrated to the United States in the late 1800s actually, my grandfather came over in 1880 and my grandmother in the early 1900s.\n\nBoth of my parents were born in California, and I’m a third generation Mexican American. Neither of my parents finished high school. There was a lot of pressure to continue to work to provide for the family.\n\nComing from a Mexican American family, it’s very family oriented, and families often work together collaboratively to provide enough money to support the families.\n\nSo I have four older siblings, and I am the second in my family to go to college, and I grew up in the central valley, working with my family in the fields, harvesting produce on the weekends and also in the summers.\n\nAnd I can tell you from my experience that the work is extremely hard, very harsh conditions, extremely hot, and the pay was minimal.\n\nSo I have a lot of respect for people, particularly labourers, that work in these types of sectors, and often these are people that are the most vulnerable and often exploited. I liked school from a very early age. I was extremely fortunate also to have great teachers and mentors in grade school and in high school, and they really served as the role models that really set a road path for me with regards to my education.\n\nThese early mentors saw my potential. They believed in me. They provided guidance and support and encouraged me to pursue an education and a career in science. When I reflect on my life and I think about how a poor Mexican American farm worker kid from an impoverished background, became a scientist professor, it’s actually extraordinary.\n\nAnd I reflect on that, you know, was it just sheer luck that I just happened to be at the right place, at the right time and meet the right people? Maybe it was, you know, innate drive, probably had part of it, just my own capacity to be resilient, to be motivated to be really committed and dedicated and goal-oriented.\n\nAnd sometimes I think maybe there was a little divine power, I don’t know, or maybe it was a bit of all of it. And, you know, it certainly was not easy, though. I had to learn a lot on my own on how to navigate the educational system.\n\nSo there have been challenges and barriers you know along the way. You know as a 60-year-old full professor, it is absolutely clear that mentorship is critical for success in everything that that one does, and particularly in science.\n\nAnd when I think about my journey through grade school, through college, through postdoctoral training, you know, mentorship was absolutely essential for my success.\n\nI would say that my background there were there are no scientists in my family, and neither of my parents finished high school, so my sister finished high school and went on to become an elementary school teacher, but she is not a scientist.\n\nSo I had this innate interest in in science based on my experience of, you know, trying to fix things, trying to understand how things work so one could fix them.\n\nAnd I took, you know, the upper division math, chemistry and physics, and I absolutely, I absolutely loved it.\n\nAnd I also had the very fortunate experience of meeting a professor from UC Berkeley that was the father of one of my high school teachers. So small world, but he was an engineer and was thrilled that I was interested in science and invited me to visit his lab at UC Berkeley.\n\nAnd that was just fascinating. And I loved it just be...it was my first time on a college campus. Being in the Bay Area in Berkeley was absolutely beautiful.\n\nAnd from that introduction and forming that relationship, Dr Oppenheim then informed me that there was an opportunity to do undergraduate research at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is part of the University of California system, which just sits right above UC Berkeley.\n\nThe views from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory are absolutely spectacular. So I applied to this internship, and I got an offer to come and work in the summer at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which, at that time, this is what’s, you know, I was 20 years old, so that was like 40 years ago, these types of experiences didn’t exist.\n\nIt was very rare to have an undergraduate come and work into a laboratory, and it was a paid internship also.\n\nI did learn later that he had some influence, again, you know the importance of networking, of getting to know people who can help you, and mentors who can really help sponsor you with these sort of activities. And that experience was absolutely transformational.\n\nI got to work in the laboratory. It was my first time actually doing experiments in college. You know, in a chemistry lab at some of the Bio Labs, you did a little bit, but was always in teams, and it was pretty limited with what you could do.\n\nBut here I was working in, you know, you know, fully functioning laboratories where there were other scientists and postdocs and students, and it was just fantastic.\n\nDr, you know, Oppenheim was, you know, an extremely generous person. He also lived up in north Berkeley, and on his property, he had a small, small cottage that they would often rent to international students. It so happened that during the summer the cottage was vacant, so I was actually able to live free of charge, you know, in the cottage.\n\nAnd that really also allowed me to be able to work at the laboratory to save some money, and just to have this amazing experience. I also got to see what it was like to live a life of as a professor. And I was like, wow, this is actually pretty good. I like this.\n\nAnd I think you know, when I reflect on this, having again crossed path with this amazing person that took interest in, you know, my education and really opened doors for me, it’s just incredible. And my experience as a mentor, as well as, you know, a faculty member, I see faculty and academics and scientists doing this all the time.\n\nWe are a community of individuals that are scientists, and we love our research, but we also understand the importance of training the next generation of scientists, of providing opportunities and access to science, because the next generation are the future of science, and so that is also our mission and our responsibility.\n\nProfessor Oppenheim was a Polish immigrant. He came from a very educated Jewish family. Immigrated to the US after World War Two.\n\nHe had life-changing experiences from World War Two that he shared with me, and really was an amazing, amazing person, and I’m very, very fortunate to have crossed paths with him.\n\nI live in a country where there is significant and growing wealth disparity in the US. This may be prevalent in other countries. I don’t know the data, but it’s very likely.\n\nAnd you know, I’m also keenly aware that there are many people from different, you know, racial, ethnic backgrounds, that lack generational wealth and live in communities that lack resources and jobs where they can live, earn a living wage to support their families.\n\nAnd people are struggling. You know, rents are high. It’s tough. And I see so many young people from, you know, low-resource communities that are brilliant, creative, forward thinking, but they can’t afford to go to high quality institutions for their education.\n\nThey can’t afford to take, you know, additional courses or tutoring to do well on standardized tests. They can’t afford to have their parents send them away, you know, in the summer, to get, you know experiences in different areas.\n\nAnd that really does disadvantage them to be competitive for the best educational institutions, graduate programs, physician scientists, training programs and so on and so forth. And I see this as a big problem and a significant waste of talent.\n\nYou know, it’s really difficult to come up with a solution, right? There’s really no clear path to how we can ensure that the brightest and the most talented people have access to opportunities in education to pursue careers in science.\n\nSo I see it as my job and my responsibility to encourage people to take advantage of as many opportunities as as they can, and again, trying to find mentors and teachers that can help guide you and provide support and sponsorship, you know, on your journey.\n\nThe other thing, though, it’s important to recognize, is that it is hard work and you really have to hustle. You have to be resilient, you have to be passionate, you have to be motivated, and you have to sacrifice.\n\nYou know, I have spent a lot of my hours working beyond an eight-hour day to be successful in my my graduate training, in my postdoctoral training. It’s not a nine to five job, but I also see this work as my passion.\n\nAnd it’s like an artist, right? It’s like your passion. It’s something that helps you thrive. And so I don’t mind working. I love I love it. I love doing science.\n\nYou know a lot of people who are just have amazing talent, and we really need to seek these individuals, you know, to pursue careers in science, because it’s really important for, you know, the scientific enterprise that we have people who come from a range of different experiences, different, different thought processes, different ways of approaching problems, how they see things differently, because all of that brings innovation and creativity to our work, and It’s really critical to push the field forward in all sorts of different areas of science, in, you know, engineering, in biomedical research and mathematics, and all of these particular areas.\n\nIt’s, it really is quite critical to have this diverse range of individuals. And there are a lot of preconceived notions about what is merit and who should be admitted to our program or who should be recruited as a faculty, and many of these merit-based decisions are based on individual performance on standardized tests or individuals grade point average, or individuals institution and over and over and over again, when people have studied these merit based parameters, they have shown that they are not the best predictors of success, right?\n\nYou know, it really has to do more with people’s motivation and determination to really pursue a career in science, and that really has to be taken into consideration.\n\nMaybe a student has a lower standardized test because they could not afford to take these additional tutorial courses to teach them how to take these standardized tests well or during college and even high school, they had to work because they needed to help their family or they needed to work in order to be able to go to college.\n\nAnd these are things that are not considered often in decisions, when we’re making decisions about admissions into programs and or hiring of faculty.\n\nSo mentorship is is very, very important, and we cannot leave mentorship up to chance, because if we leave it up to chance, we’re going to have a situation where some people are going to get extraordinary mentorship, and others may get no mentorship.\n\nAnd this can be applied to students to postdocs to early career faculty.\n\nAnd you know, in my mind, it’s very simple is you create a structure, a program, where everybody has access to effective mentorship, where everyone has access to participate in programs that will help them learn how to write a grant, where everyone has access to a program who will help them understand all the different types of skillsets that they need to develop, to become an academic, or to become a scientist, or to be promoted within an academic institutions, or to seek a position in industry, or those sort of things.\n\nAnd so you create structure, and you then utilize within the structure or program activities that have been shown to be evidence-based, effective in improving whatever the program’s intent is to improve.\n\nYou also need to evaluate programs. You need to assess outcomes. You need to determine whether your idea, it’s like doing science, right? You have a hypothesis, you create an experimental design, you do the experiment, and then you get the data, and are the data meaningful?\n\nBut you got to have the important controls right, and you have to evaluate this, and it’s the same sort of concept, but we’re doing it with people and programs, and it actually works.\n\nI’m always astonished by the success of these programs, and then how we see no difference based on gender, no difference based on race or ethnicity that everyone is doing equally well in this system where everyone has access to the same mentors and activities that the program provides.\n\nWhen I think about how I started, which was, you know, now, dating myself, you know, started my academic position actually in 2000 so that’s like 25 years ago, it was a very different environment.\n\nYou know, we didn’t have as many platforms to connect with people beyond your neighbours in the same building down the hallway, and it was a lonely experience.\n\nAnd when I think about how I started and what I did, and what I would do differently if I was that person, (wind back) is I would be much more proactive in building networks, in establishing collaborations and developing relationships with other scientists, both within my institution and outside of my institution.\n\nAnd I was sort of under the impression when I started as an academic that it was frowned upon to collaborate, because people would think that you weren’t capable of doing the work by yourself. So it was more of a need to collaborate, and maybe people would have viewed me that way, but I know from experiences, it’s a lot more fun, it’s a lot more creative, the work is better when it’s done collaboratively with people.\n\nThe scientific community is an amazing community, and to work with people, to collaborate with people, to get to know people, and it just, it just makes science better.\n\nIt’s, it’s a way of being inclusive of the scientific community is really, really important.\n\nI intentionally now try to interact and collaborate more with early career faculty, with junior faculty, putting them on grants.\n\nFirst of all, they’re really smart. Second of all, they understand computational biology a lot better than I do.\n\nAnd I can benefit from having them, because they bring different skillsets.\n\nAnd they can benefit from me, because I can help them with generating the hypothesis. I understand the biology more. I am more of a biologist, and we’re a wet bench lab, and so can provide them with, you know, those research aspects of their career. So I really enjoy having these relationships with the junior faculty, particularly.\n\nDeborah Daley 21:22\n\nIn the next episode we meet a biochemist in Kathmandu who is determined to improve access and opportunities for Nepalese girls and women in STEM careers.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto**\nEn Sudáfrica, el trabajo sexual ha sido ilegal durante muchos años, lo que ha hecho que sea peligroso para las personas involucradas. Las leyes a menudo confunden el trabajo sexual con la trata de personas, pero son temas diferentes. Esta confusión ha causado problemas tanto para los trabajadores sexuales como para las víctimas de trata.\n\n**Qué pasó**\nEl 1 y 2 de septiembre de 2025, la Corte Superior del Cabo Occidental de Sudáfrica escuchará un caso que podría cambiar la ley y dejar de tratar el trabajo sexual como un delito. Grandes organizaciones como Human Rights Watch y Amnistía Internacional apoyan el caso con investigaciones que muestran que criminalizar el trabajo sexual no hace que las personas estén más seguras.\n\n**Impacto**\nSi el tribunal decide despenalizar el trabajo sexual, esto ayudará a los trabajadores a protegerse mejor y a trabajar sin miedo a ser arrestados. También facilitará que reciban atención médica y compartan información para combatir la trata de personas. En general, este cambio podría reducir la violencia y la discriminación, haciendo las comunidades más seguras.\n\n**Próximo paso**\nDespués de las audiencias, los jueces decidirán si cambian la ley. Si la decisión es positiva, Sudáfrica podría ser uno de los primeros países en tratar el trabajo sexual como un trabajo normal, dando a los trabajadores sexuales los mismos derechos y protecciones que a otros trabajadores. Este caso podría inspirar cambios similares en otros países.\n\n**Resumen en una frase**\nEl próximo caso judicial en Sudáfrica podría acabar con la criminalización del trabajo sexual, mejorando la seguridad y los derechos de los trabajadores sexuales y ayudando a combatir más eficazmente la trata.",

      "summary": "Before Pedro Matos joined the World Food Programme (WFP) for 17 years, he said his job in space engineering just “wasn’t enough”.",
      "content": "Ahead of donning a beige WFP vest and boots to face hurricanes, wars and refugee camps, the Portuguese scientist worked with satellite imagery and cartography, creating maps to support humanitarian missions, until he realised he didn’t want to stay behind a computer screen.\n\nOn the occasion of World Humanitarian Day, marked annually on 19 August, Mr. Matos shared his story with UN News.\n\nWFP/Marco Frattini Pedro Matos joined the WFP response team following the deadly Cyclone Idai in Mozambique in 2019. (file)\n\nFrom hurricanes to war\n\n“At a certain point, it just wasn’t enough,” he recalled about his space engineering job. “I didn’t want to be making maps for other people to go and do humanitarian responses. I want to take those maps and be the one to do the responding.”\n\nThat’s exactly what he did. At WFP, he first developed maps on the ground and then went on to coordinate the agency’s emergency operations.\n\nSince then, he has visited dozens of countries often at the epicentre of crises, from Hurricane Idai in Mozambique to the outbreak of war in Ukraine.\n\nWFP/Michelle Sanson In 2018, Pedro Matos looks at the Kutupalong refugee camp where Rohingya refugees live. (file)\n\n‘Like moving an entire government’\n\nCoordinating in an emergency response is like “moving an entire government”, where each UN agency represents a “ministry” and the response only works when everyone comes together over the four essential areas in a crisis response: food, shelter, water and health.\n\nHaving just returned from a mission in Bangladesh, he described efforts to respond at Cox’s Bazar, the world’s largest refugee camp and home to 700,000 people who fled violence in Myanmar.\n\n“We’ve been able to provide better conditions for people to live in this limbo with a little more comfort,” he said, also remembering his visit there in 2018 at the height of the crisis.\n\nAt the time, “a million people crossed the border in a month.” Today, although they remain in “limbo”, he pointed to improvements such as more monsoon-resistant homes and roads, gas stoves and reforestation.\n\nJohnny Shipley Pedro Matos on board a humanitarian aid flight after Cyclone Idai in Mozambique. (file)\n\nHeart-shredding challenges and profound rewards\n\nThe job has meant both challenges and rewards.\n\n“We’ve also had a few instances where we’ve been kidnapped, or come under fire, but it’s not the things that happen to us that impact us the most,” he said. “It’s the things that happen to others that have the most impact.”\n\nHurricane Idai in Mozambique was a Category 5 hurricane that hit Beira in 2019 was one of the biggest and most intense crisis, but also most rewarding, he said.\n\n“There’s this mix of something that was very intense and hard because we couldn’t reach everyone, but at the same time, the fact was that there were many people – tens or hundreds of thousands of people – who would have died if we hadn’t been there,” he said. “That was the most impactful response in my 17 years at the United Nations.”\n\nWhen he was in Yemen, “we were bombed 20 times a day” in the capital, Sana’a, he said, adding that “there’s a strange normalcy” that develops.\n\n“We find ourselves saying things like, ‘no, that wasn’t very far; it was only 500 metres from here,’” he said. “It’s something I never thought I’d think or say before doing this work.”\n\nWhen reaching central Ukraine several weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion in early 2022, he called the situation “very intense”. Within a week, he and his colleagues began distributing money to people coming from the frontlines.\n\nWe couldn’t reach everyone, but there were tens or hundreds of thousands of people who would have died if we hadn’t been there.\n\n“When we interviewed people and asked them what they were doing with the money we gave them, it was very gratifying,” he said. “It was beautiful.”\n\nThose who had been wounded in the war were using the money to buy painkillers. Others used it to pay for gas to escape the frontlines. One mother had been able to buy her daughter a scoop of ice cream for the first time since the war began.\n\n“Her daughter was delighted,” he said. “There are very rewarding moments.”\n\nFeeding millions every day\n\n“We all think we know what the humanitarian or aid sector is,” Mr. Matos explained, adding that the scale during a crisis is much, much larger.\n\n“I thought we’d be rehabilitating schools, feeding 100 people,” he continued. “I never imagined I’d be feeding 13 million people a day in Yemen. The scale is absolutely incredible.”\n\nHowever, humanitarian work is often seen as a separate job, he said. Almost every profession that exists in private and government sectors also exists in an aid landscape, from lawyers, those who work in procurement, like in supermarkets, and human resources.\n\n“I basically do the same work as social workers or firefighters,” he said. “They do it here every day, and I do it elsewhere. But, our work is in the same field and very similar.”\n\n© WFP/Ahmed Basha A toddler eats a food supplement, as part of WFP's nutrition programme, in Mokha, Taiz, in Yemen.\n\nThe value of a Nobel Prize\n\nWFP was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020, a recognition that Mr. Matos received with humility.\n\n“Our work is largely invisible, despite feeding 120 million people every day,” he said. “It gave us a platform to raise awareness about crises like Congo, Myanmar, Sudan and Gaza, which often go unnoticed.”\n\nOur work is largely invisible, despite feeding 120 million people every day.\n\nHe said his job is to give voice to the voiceless when crises fade from news headlines. Despite the difficulties and risks across his career, Mr. Matos has no doubt about the most important lesson he learned.\n\n“People are essentially good,” he said. “When faced with the imminence of tragedy, people are fundamentally good and want to help others, even if that other person is very different. It was good to realise this because it’s not always obvious when we’re far from these crises.”",

      "title": "‘I painted so prison wouldn’t swallow us whole’: An interview with Iranian journalist Vida Rabbani",
      "summary": "“[T]hrough brushwork and imagery, she documented what she could not publish: the contours of captivity and the quiet, defiant rituals of daily survival.”",
      "content": "Inside the walls of Tehran’s Evin Prison — a space synonymous with repression and pain — Vida Rabbani created a language of resistance through painting. Using bedsheets as canvas, smuggled brushes, and colors brought in tube by tube, she documented the intimate textures of carceral life in Iran’s most notorious women’s prison ward. Her work, both courageous and tender, transformed confinement into a form of creation. From portraits of fellow political prisoners to layered renderings of institutional staircases, Rabbani’s paintings gave a visual voice to the unseen lives of women navigating both isolation and solidarity behind bars. Her images were not just acts of self-expression; they became acts of collective preservation.\n\nRabbani, a journalist and former reporter at Shargh Daily and Seda Weekly, had never considered herself a professional artist. But following her 2022 arrest during Iran’s anti-government protests and her subsequent sentencing to more than 11 years combined over two cases, she began to paint in earnest. She spent 32 months in prison before her sentence was suspended, and she was released from Evin Prison. The Iranian authorities may have tried to stifle her speech, but through brushwork and imagery, she documented what she could not publish: the contours of captivity and the quiet, defiant rituals of daily survival.\n\n“In prison, limitations sharpen the imagination,” she said. “When space and materials are scarce, your mind does the work of finding freedom.” Rabbani’s art evolved in secret, sometimes illuminated only by a desk lamp late at night, and often under the threat of confiscation. Aided by fellow inmates, she covertly assembled acrylics and brushes, stretching fabric over wooden frames salvaged from the prison’s carpentry shop.\n\nWhile her early murals — such as one of the endangered Persian cheetah Pirouz — were painted directly onto courtyard walls, Rabbani soon turned inward, sketching rooms, beds, and portraits that conveyed not just presence but memory. The paintings, all modest in scale yet expansive in emotional reach, trace a remarkable arc of visual storytelling under constraint.\n\nIn an interview with Global Voices, Vida Rabbani spoke about documenting the visual culture of prison, the improvisational methods behind her work, the emotional toll and healing of art-making under surveillance, and how painting became her most powerful form of witness.\n\nExcerpts from the interview follow:\n\nOmid Memarian (OM): When did you first start painting, and how did it evolve alongside your work in journalism?\n\nVida Rabbani (VR): Memories start differently for everyone. I don’t remember exactly how old I was, but ever since I can recall, I have been drawn to painting and crafting. We were a middle-class family living in a remote town in southern Iran. I was obsessed with stationery shops — still am. I remember only owning two dolls throughout my childhood, but I was in love with picture books, coloring supplies, and playdough. My mother was protective of my tools, making sure I didn’t ruin them.\n\nAround the age of four, I began painting. I vividly remember the joy of finally receiving a six-color gouache set and a box of markers. In school, I was considered one of the better painters, even placing third in a national competition once. But instead of encouragement, my family saw my interest in art as a threat, especially my mother, who dreamed I’d become a doctor. She feared painting would distract me from studying. In third grade, I secretly enrolled in an art class and continued for a few years. But I didn’t return to painting seriously until I was imprisoned in Evin.\n\nOM: What themes did you explore in your prison paintings, and what did they mean to you?\n\nVR: It began when I helped a fellow inmate with a drawing, and others responded so warmly that I picked up my own brush. The enthusiasm of others encouraged me to request painting supplies, which my husband brought to the prison.\n\nI started by painting murals. One depicted Pirouz sprinting across a wall, dedicated to fellow inmates and environmental activists Sepideh Kashani and Niloufar Bayani. Another mural revealed a forest path behind crumbling bricks, symbolizing escape. Authorities painted over them, claiming they were politically subversive, and banned any more art supplies.\n\nNear the 2024 New Year, I spent 10 to 12 days painting prison walls to refresh the space. What began as a way to brighten our environment became a daily act of resistance and renewal.\n\nLater, other inmates asked me to paint their beds, rooms, or corners of the ward to share with their families. This inspired me to document the women’s ward in a way others outside could see. My first interior painting was a view of the Evin hills from my cell window.\n\nAlthough I had never painted portraits before, I wanted to show what imprisonment did to people’s faces and spirits. I painted Golrokh Iraee — my first-ever portrait. Later, when Pakhshan Azizi received a death sentence, my friend Hasti Amiri, who was about to be released, asked me to paint Pakhshan so she could raise awareness. I painted it by lamplight in bed the night before her release. Since photography was banned, drawing became the only way to visually archive people and spaces in prison.\n\nOM: Given the restrictions, how did you get art supplies in prison?\n\nVR: One of the prisoners helped by smuggling in oil paints and brushes during family visits, hiding them in her clothes. It took months to gather enough supplies.\n\nEventually, for the New Year, Narges Mohammadi [the 2023 Nobel Peace Laureate] convinced the authorities to let us bring in a larger shipment of materials. I took advantage of this to sneak in proper acrylic paints among the wall paints.\n\nOM: What obstacles did you face while painting in prison, and how did you overcome them?\n\nVR: There were many. I had no canvases, so I repurposed a wooden frame from the prison’s carpentry workshop and stretched bedsheets over it with nails. That’s why all my paintings are 70 x 50 cm [19.6 x 27.5 inches]. Paints were limited — white, especially, ran out quickly — so I used color sparingly. The paint layers are very thin as a result.\n\nWhen my brushes wore out, I sat in front of the warden’s office all day until they agreed to give me a palette knife and two brushes, on the condition that I wouldn’t take any artworks out without permission.\n\nOM: What impact did painting have on your mental and emotional state during imprisonment?\n\nVR: Though I never felt useless in prison, painting gave me new energy and purpose. I’d wake up excited to continue my work. I observed the ward constantly, looking for new subjects. I knew I wouldn’t have time to paint everything I wanted before my release, so I sketched prolifically to continue later outside. It made time pass faster and transformed my prison experience into an artistic opportunity I didn’t want to lose.\n\nOM: How did other inmates and prison staff respond to your work?\n\nVR: It was the inmates’ reactions that encouraged me most. I had initially planned to focus on reading and studying, but their enthusiasm pulled me into art. During the New Year, when I painted the stairwell, they constantly checked in on me, brought me food and coffee, and made me feel like I was doing something meaningful.\n\nSome nights, I’d come back exhausted and find a meal waiting on my bed. I don’t think I’ve ever felt as appreciated or purposeful as I did during those days. One inmate told me the murals had brought the spirit of Nowruz into the ward.\n\n\n\nOM: Did the experience influence your artistic style or technique?\n\nVR: I wasn’t a trained artist with a defined style. I had a basic understanding of various techniques but no formal education. I never liked photorealism — too much detail doesn’t appeal to me. I prefer visible brushstrokes and texture. I avoided blending colors too smoothly.\n\nStill, when I look at my prison paintings together, I see clear growth. My technique improved dramatically, and I gained much more confidence.\n\nOM: Now that you’re free, do you plan to exhibit or publish your prison paintings?\n\nVR: Yes, absolutely. I painted for two reasons: to make the prison more livable, and to show others what it looked and felt like inside. If I can exhibit these works, I would be thrilled. They were never just for me; they were always meant to be shared.\n\nOM: Do your paintings carry a specific message?\n\nVR: I tried to capture the atmosphere of prison — sometimes joyful, sometimes bleak. I wanted to reflect the rhythm of life inside. Emotions are heightened in prison. Grief, joy, solitude, solidarity; they're all more intense than on the outside. I hope that comes through in my work.\n\nOM: Have other imprisoned artists inspired you?\n\nVR: During a short leave from prison, I saw a BBC piece about a British man who began painting during his 13-year sentence for heroin trafficking. He said art changed his life, and after his release, he became a professional painter and even won awards. I joked with my friends that my sentence was too short; if I’d had 10 more years, maybe I’d have become a prize-winning artist too.\n\nOM: Artists like Richard Dadd created remarkable works while imprisoned. Do you feel that incarceration stimulated your creativity in any way?\n\nVR: I don’t think it’s just a cliché that limitations fuel creativity. When your physical environment and resources are restricted, you’re forced to rely more on your imagination to find solutions and adapt. That mental effort pushes the mind into motion. Perhaps psychologists could explain it better, but for me, that’s precisely what happened.",
