The ruling, made public on November 18, 2025, is a landmark victory for equality, ending a regime of state-sanctioned discrimination that violated the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) officers. In Judgment TC/1225/25, the court held that article 210 of the Code of Justice of the National Police and article 260 of the Code of Justice of the Armed Forces violate constitutional guarantees to nondiscrimination, privacy, free development of personality, and the right to work. Both articles punished same-sex “sodomy” by officers with up to two years and one year in prison, respectively. No equivalent penalties existed for heterosexual sexual acts. “For decades, these provisions forced LGBT officers to live in fear of punishment simply for who they are,” said Cristian González Cabrera, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “This ruling is a resounding affirmation that a more inclusive future is both possible and required under Dominican law.”In an amicus curiae brief submitted to the court in August 2024, Human Rights Watch argued that the criminalization of same-sex conduct violates international standards, including the rights to be protected against arbitrary and unlawful interference with one’s private and family life and to one’s reputation or dignity, as emphasized by the United Nations independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity.In its ruling, the court emphasized that the criminalization of same-sex conduct in the security forces lacked “a legitimate constitutional interest or aims to strengthen and improve institutional efficiency.” Notably, the court found that “no regulation issued by state authorities or private individuals may diminish or restrict in any way a person’s rights based on their sexual orientation, an essential aspect of personal privacy and the free development of personality.”The ruling aligns with a regional trend. In recent years, countries in the region, including Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and the United States, have eliminated similar discriminatory laws and policies that criminalized same-sex conduct by officers. Anderson Javiel Dirocie De León, one of the lawyers who brought the challenge, said: “This positive outcome represents the first case of general applicability advancing equality and dignity for LGBTI people in the Dominican Republic. There is still a long way to go, but it sets a historic precedent in the fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation.”His co-counsel, Patricia M. Santana Nina, said: “This decision marks a decisive step toward ensuring that these institutions, as well as any public or private body, adapt their rules and practices to guarantee that no person is discriminated against or sanctioned for their sexual orientation.”The Dominican Republic lags behind on LGBT and intersex rights compared with its Latin American neighbors, Human Rights Watch said. It lacks comprehensive civil antidiscrimination legislation, same-sex marriage or civil union rights, and gender identity recognition for transgender people, among other key protections. In the Caribbean region, five Anglophone countries—Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago—still have laws on the books that criminalize consensual same-sex conduct, a relic of British colonialism. Consensual same-sex conduct remains criminalized in 65 countries, including Iran, Myanmar, and Sudan.  “President Luis Abinader and Congress should use the momentum of this landmark ruling to advance long-overdue protections for LGBT people,” González said. “By moving forward with laws addressing discrimination and violence, the Dominican Republic can align itself with progress in Latin America and demonstrate a genuine commitment to equality and dignity for all.”",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nDignity and wellness access for underserved populations\n\nWelcome to the fourth week of The Optimist Daily’s Annual Local Changemakers series. This week, we highlight leaders ensuring that basic human needs like hygiene, nourishment, and health are met with creativity and compassion.\n\nIn San Luis Obispo County, California, Gwen Watkins transformed a simple idea into a mobile movement for dignity. In her seventies, Gwen launched Shower the People, a volunteer-run mobile hygiene nonprofit that’s now delivered more than 25,000 showers and counting.\n\nOne woman, one idea, and a whole lot of heart\n\nIt started with a need Gwen Watkins couldn’t ignore. In San Luis Obispo County, many unhoused individuals were unable to access the church-based shower services available in the area. Gwen recognized the gap, and at an age when many would be stepping back from service, she stepped up.\n\nIn her seventies, she began fundraising for a mobile shower trailer that could go where people were, not the other way around. After two years of determined effort, Shower the People officially launched in 2017 with a sustainable, completely volunteer-run model that continues to serve the community with compassion, consistency, and genuine human connection.\n\nAs nominator Alicia put it:\n\n“Gwen saw a need… Many folks can’t travel to the churches that provided shower services, and the mobile van brought the showers to areas where folks could access them more easily, providing them with a sense of dignity.”\n\nWith no blueprint but plenty of resolve, Gwen designed the program to be sustainable, flexible, and centered on the people it served. Her approach was simple but profound: meet people where they are, greet them by name, and make every interaction a moment of respect and care. As the organization’s new General Manager Gary Petersen explained:\n\n“Her vision was that the unhoused could find a place to be treated with dignity, called by their own name each time they arrived, and get a shower, supplies, and referrals for local services. She always emphasized, ‘We do showers.’”\n\nA growing community care hub\n\nWhat started as a mobile hygiene effort has grown into a robust, wraparound support network. As volunteer coordinator Kevin Dunlap shared with The Optimist Daily:\n\n“It is interesting to note that Shower the People is a completely volunteer-driven organization. From the Board, General Manager to the Shower Cleaners, there are no paid positions.”\n\nThat spirit of service is part of why the organization has grown into a wider care network. At sites like the alley behind the San Luis Obispo Library, Shower the People now offers, among other services:\n\nFree monthly health clinics in partnership with Vituity Cares, Access Support Network, and WashMeGo. In 2024 alone, these clinics served 340 guests, providing over 120 medical exams, 70 vaccinations, treatment, testing, and even haircuts and hot meals.\n\nNo-cook food bags from the SLO Food Bank, tailored to unhoused residents’ nutritional needs and distributed by STP volunteers at Thursday shower shifts.\n\nA new healthcare access guide, created by STP, which demystifies local medical and mental health resources for those without stable housing. The resource outlines eligibility, walk-in options, insurance requirements, and more, making healthcare less intimidating and more reachable.\n\nVeteran outreach at events like Veterans Stand Down in Santa Maria, where STP has provided showers every year since 2017.\n\nRegular hygiene days with community partners that transform shower sites into pop-up wellness hubs.\n\nThese services are essential to the community, as it is clear that the need continues to grow. Last month alone, more than 700 guests came for showers, supplies, or referrals.\n\nEach guest receives a clean T‑shirt, underwear, socks, toiletries, a towel and washcloth, and 15 minutes of private hot water. These seemingly small, simple things really deliver a big impact.\n\nAt the heart of it all are the volunteers, whom Gwen often called “the backbone of this work.” As one volunteer told KSBY News:\n\n“Everybody who’s part of the organization is doing it because they want to be there. The more volunteers we have, the more effective we can be.”\n\nA legacy in motion\n\nGwen officially retired at the end of 2024, but her vision lives on through the thriving nonprofit she built. In a resolution honoring her, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors wrote:\n\n“Her compassion, generosity, and humble leadership have guided the efforts of the all-volunteer-run organization since its founding in 2017.”\n\nThat legacy of seeing a need, showing up, and staying steady continues to ripple outward with every clean towel handed out and every guest reminded of their worth.\n\nSupport or get involved\n\nVisit their website: showerthepeopleslo.org\n\nFollow them on Instagram: @showerthepeopleslo\n\nTake a look at their volunteer opportunities!",

      "summary": "The world-first law aims to reduce the \"risks\" children face online - but it's received pushback.",
      "content": "Australia is banning social media for kids under 16. How will it work?\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Helen Livingstone Sydney Share Save\n\nGetty Images The ban on under-16s using social media is a world first\n\nFrom 10 December, social media companies will have to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed. The government says the ban - a world-first policy popular with many parents - is aimed at reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, which come from \"design features that encourage them to spend more time on screens, while also serving up content that can harm their health and wellbeing\". A study commissioned by the government earlier this year said 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour. This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide. One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.\n\nWhat platforms are affected?\n\nThe Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch. It is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord have recently introduced age checks on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban. The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so. These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material. YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.\n\nHow will the ban be enforced?\n\nChildren and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches. The government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones. Several possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.\n\nGetty Images A recent Australian government study found 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media - and seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour\n\nThe government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods. It has also said platforms cannot rely on users declaring their own age, or on parents vouching for their children. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has announced it will begin closing teen accounts from 4 December. Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said. The other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.\n\nWill it work?\n\nWithout a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage. The government's own report found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target. Questions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\". Critics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors. Others point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective. Communications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\". \"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"\n\nAre there data protection concerns?\n\nCritics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages. Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published. But the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches. It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.\n\nHow have social media companies responded?\n\nSocial media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy. They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies. YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nGetty Images Though included in the ban, YouTube has denied being a social media company\n\nEven as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\". At parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it. Kick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.\n\nDo other countries have similar bans?\n\nThe ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved. In the UK, new safety rules introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content. Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a French parliamentary enquiry recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds. Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access. Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.\n\nWill children try to get around the ban?",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Australia has introduced a world-first law to stop children under 16 from using social media. This comes after studies showed many kids face harmful content and risks like cyberbullying, grooming, and exposure to dangerous ideas online.\n\n**What happened** – From December 10, social media companies must prevent under-16s from creating accounts and remove existing ones. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and others are included. The government will fine companies up to $49.5 million if they don’t follow the rules. Kids and parents won’t be punished.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time a country has made a law banning social media for younger teens to protect their mental health and safety. It targets harmful content and behaviors that many children currently face online. The law also pushes companies to use new ways to check users’ ages, like ID checks or face scans, rather than trusting kids to say their age.\n\n**What's next step** – Social media companies will need to develop and use age verification tools before the law starts. The government will keep reviewing which platforms are covered and may add gaming sites in the future. Experts and parents will watch closely to see if the ban really helps kids stay safer online.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Australia is leading the world with a new law that requires social media companies to block children under 16, aiming to reduce online harms and improve young people’s wellbeing.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L'Australie a adopté une loi unique au monde pour interdire aux enfants de moins de 16 ans d'utiliser les réseaux sociaux. Cette décision fait suite à des études montrant que beaucoup d'enfants sont exposés à des contenus dangereux et à des risques comme le cyberharcèlement et le grooming.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – À partir du 10 décembre, les entreprises de réseaux sociaux doivent empêcher les moins de 16 ans de créer des comptes et supprimer ceux déjà existants. Des plateformes comme Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube et d'autres sont concernées. Le gouvernement peut infliger des amendes allant jusqu'à 49,5 millions de dollars aux entreprises qui ne respectent pas la loi. Les enfants et leurs parents ne seront pas punis.\n\n**Impact** – C'est la première fois qu'un pays adopte une loi interdisant aux jeunes adolescents d'utiliser les réseaux sociaux pour protéger leur santé mentale et leur sécurité. La loi vise les contenus et comportements nuisibles auxquels beaucoup d'enfants sont confrontés en ligne. Elle oblige aussi les entreprises à utiliser de nouveaux moyens pour vérifier l'âge des utilisateurs, comme les pièces d'identité ou la reconnaissance faciale, au lieu de se fier à la déclaration des enfants.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les entreprises devront mettre en place des outils de vérification d'âge avant l'entrée en vigueur de la loi. Le gouvernement continuera à revoir la liste des plateformes concernées et pourrait inclure les sites de jeux en ligne. Les experts et les parents suivront de près pour voir si cette interdiction aide vraiment les enfants à être plus en sécurité sur internet.\n\n**Message principal en une phrase** – L'Australie prend les devants avec une nouvelle loi obligeant les réseaux sociaux à bloquer les moins de 16 ans, pour réduire les dangers en ligne et protéger le bien-être des jeunes.\n",

Some became deputies! Imagine an exercise of this nature in different capitals, in different Parliaments, combining efforts with existing programs of this nature in the European Parliament,” he added, before his peers from other parliaments of the European Union.\n\nJosé Pedro Aguiar-Branco added that it is necessary to “create spaces for people to debate” and, although he recognizes the role of social media in this intention, “that does not erase the importance of human contact.”\n\n“The confrontation of ideas also has to be in person. This leads to the importance of creating debate spaces with citizens. Including European themes,” he advocated. (19/11/25)",
