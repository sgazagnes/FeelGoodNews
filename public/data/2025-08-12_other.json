      "content": "Keeping sea routes safe today while also addressing emerging challenges was the focus of a debate in the UN Security Council on Monday which was convened by Panama, president for the month of August.\n\nArsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), told the Council that last year, a workforce of just 1.9 million seafarers moved over 12.3 billion tonnes of goods, essentially “keeping global trade afloat”.\n\nSafety and security fundamental\n\nHe said the maritime sector has proved to be “remarkably resilient” in the face of geopolitical challenges.\n\n“Yet resilience cannot breed complacency,” he warned.\n\n“The safety and security of the maritime sector is fundamental to economic stability, sustainable maritime development and to livelihoods.”\n\nMultiple threats\n\nThe threats are numerous. Nearly 150 incidents of piracy and armed robbery were reported in 2024 alone. In some regions such as Southeast Asia, incidents are surging, according to the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL).\n\nBeyond piracy, international vessels plying the Red Sea have also come under attack against the backdrop of the war in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, trafficking continues – including drugs, endangered wildlife and protected timber – and organized crime groups tap into criminal supply chains to move weapons, operatives and illicit goods to finance their operations.\n\nILO Photo/Marcel Crozet Seafarers work in the engine room of a Chinese registered ship in the Port of Genoa in Italy. (file)\n\nA ‘network’ under attack\n\nMaritime routes were “the world’s first truly global network,” connecting distant shores for thousands of years, said Valdecy Urquiza, INTERPOL Secretary General.\n\n“Today, and more than ever, that same network is exploited by criminals who threaten navigation, trade, communication – and with them, the global stability essential to sustainable development,” he told the Council.\n\nHe said the “poly-criminality at sea” is “making criminals more resilient, and enforcement more complex” as new and less visible dangers arise.\n\n“As ports go digital – with automated vessel management, cargo tracking and logistics – vulnerabilities are emerging faster than they can be secured. Ports are facing a wave of cyber intrusions targeting the power, communication and logistics systems they rely on.”\n\nFurthermore, “cybercriminals can weaponise artificial intelligence to attack with greater speed, scale and precision.”\n\nGlobal coordination, environmental action\n\nIn response to the situation, IMO has developed binding mandatory requirements, for example to address international ship and port security as well as cybersecurity threats.\n\nThe UN agency has also supported projects to boost regional capacity, including information sharing. This is in addition to establishing partnerships with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), INTERPOL, regional entities and donor States, aimed at strengthening national capabilities and building trust.\n\n“While addressing maritime security, we must not lose sight of our responsibility to protect the ocean,” said Mr. Dominguez.\n\n“Maritime safety and security and environmental stewardship go hand in hand. Support for countries to develop and enhance response capabilities for maritime pollution incidents including from oil spills is ongoing.”\n\nUN News/Daniel Dickinson A ship passes through the Panama Canal in Central America. (file)\n\nPerspectives from the Panama Canal\n\nThe Council also heard from the agency responsible for the operation of the Panama Canal, one of the world’s most important maritime corridors.\n\nRicaurte Vásquez Morales, CEO of the Panama Canal Authority, shared perspectives from “one of the most emblematic channels for human cooperation,” highlighting the strength of “principles-based neutrality.”\n\n“The Panama Canal is governed by an international treaty which safeguards equal access to all nations in times of peace or war,” he said, speaking in Spanish.\n\n“This promise, which is incorporated in our Constitution, has enabled a small country to contribute stability to global trade, shielding this infrastructure from geopolitical tensions that also too often stymied progress.”\n\nHis remarks also showcased how the Canal has been under Panamanian administration for the last 25 years – a period which saw the completion of a third set of locks in 2016. As a result, the cargo volume transiting its waters increased by 50 per cent, while maintaining the same annual transit of roughly 13,500.\n\nClimate adaptation\n\nLike the IMO chief, Mr. Vásquez Morales also emphasised the need to address climate change. The Panama Canal experienced a drought over the past two years and this “global wake-up call” sparked water conservation efforts, logistical adjustments and the building of an artificial lake.\n\n“Today, the canal boasts technologies that strengthen climate resilience,” he said.\n\n“It creates financial mechanisms and ensures water and environmental security, while at the same time implementing efficient governance to harness the rapid progress in artificial intelligence and collaborating to strengthen cyber security on our roads and our logistics systems.”\n\nCommitment, peace and solidarity\n\nConcluding his remarks, Mr. Vásquez Morales insisted that “the Panama Canal is living proof that global public goods can be administered with equity, responsibility and vision.”\n\n“Through sustained cooperation, constant adaptation and steadfast commitment to the principles of international law, the Canal will remain a safe and efficient route ready to serve not only this generation, but also many more to come,” he said.\n\n“We trust that by working together, we will be able to keep open, not only waterways, but also the channels of understanding peace and solidarity.”",

Climbing fees brought in $5.9m last year, with Everest accounting for more than three quarters of that.\n\nNepal's tourism department said it hopes the initiative will highlight the country's \"unexplored tourism products and destinations\".\n\nIt comes as permit fees to summit Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, during peak season will go up to $15,000 (£11,170) from September - the first increase in nearly a decade.\n\nNepal will make 97 of its Himalayan mountains free to climb for the next two years in a bid to boost tourism in some of its more remote areas.\n\nThe peaks for which fees will be waived are located in Nepal's Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces, standing between 5,970m (19,590 ft) and 7,132m high.\n\nBoth provinces, located in the far-western region of Nepal, are among the country's poorest and least developed provinces.\n\n\"Despite their breathtaking beauty, the number of tourists and mountaineers here is very low as access is so difficult. We hope the new provision will help,\" said Himal Gautam, director of Nepal's Tourism Department.\n\n\"They can create jobs, generate income, and strengthen the local economy,\" he said, as reported by The Kathmandu Post.\n\nBut it is unclear if authorities have plans to improve infrastructure and connectivity to these remote areas - and how well communities in these areas might cope with an influx of climbers, if the free-to-climb initiative does take off.\n\nClimbers have historically shown little interest in these 97 remote peaks - only 68 of them have ventured there in the last two years. In contrast, some 421 climbing permits were issued for Everest in 2024 alone.\n\nEverest, the world's highest peak at over 8,849m, has in recent years been plagued by overcrowding, environmental concerns and a series of fatal climbing attempts.\n\nIn April 2024, Nepal's Supreme Court ordered the government to limit the number of mountaineering permits issued for Everest and several other peaks, saying that the mountains' capacity \"must be respected\".\n\nIn January this year, authorities announced a 36% mark-up in permit fees. For those attempting the summit outside the peak April to May season, it will now cost $7,500 to climb Everest during September to November and $3,750 during December to February.\n\nNepal's parliament is also debating a new law that will require anyone wanting to scale Everest to have first summited a mountain over 7,000m in the country.\n\nThis makes the peaks in Karnali and Sudurpaschim \"ideal training grounds\", according to The Kathmandu Post.",

      "content": "British man who perished in Antarctic glacier found 65 years later\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Georgina Rannard Climate and science correspondent Share Save\n\nDavid Bell Dennis Bell was on a two-year assignment in Antarctica\n\nThe bones of a British man who died in a terrible accident in Antarctica in 1959 have been discovered in a melting glacier. The remains were found in January by a Polish Antarctic expedition, alongside a wristwatch, a radio, and a pipe. He has now been formally identified as Dennis \"Tink\" Bell, who fell into a crevasse aged 25 when working for the organisation that became the British Antarctic Survey. \"I had long given up on finding my brother. It is just remarkable, astonishing. I can't get over it,\" David Bell, 86, tells BBC News.\n\nBritish Antarctic Survey Dennis Bell in 1959 at the Admiralty Bay station - he was known for his love of the husky dogs\n\n\"Dennis was one of the many brave personnel who contributed to the early science and exploration of Antarctica under extraordinarily harsh conditions,\" says Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey . \"Even though he was lost in 1959, his memory lived on among colleagues and in the legacy of polar research,\" she adds.\n\nDariusz Puczko The bones were found on the moraine and surface of the Ecology Glacier, on western shore of Admiralty Bay\n\nIt was David who answered the door in his family home in Harrow, London, in July 1959. \"The telegram boy said, 'I'm sorry to tell you, but this is bad news',\" he says. He went upstairs to tell his parents. \"It was a horrendous moment,\" he adds. Talking to me from his home in Australia and sitting next to his wife Yvonne, David smiles as stories from his childhood in 1940s England spill out. They are the memories of a younger sibling admiring a charming, adventurous big brother. \"Dennis was fantastic company. He was very amusing. The life and soul of wherever he happened to be,\" David says.\n\nDavid Bell, 86, spoke to BBC News from his home in Australia\n\n\"I still can't get over this, but one evening when me, my mother and father came home from the cinema,\" he says. \"And I have to say this in fairness to Dennis, he had put a newspaper down on the kitchen table, but on top of it, he'd taken a motorbike engine apart and it was all over the table,\" he says. \"I can remember his style of dress, he always used to wear duffel coats. He was just an average sort of fellow who enjoyed life,\" he adds.\n\nD. Bell Dennis Bell is on the far right of the picture, celebrating Christmas in Antarctica in 1958 - seven months before he died\n\nDennis Bell, nickednamed \"Tink\", was born in 1934. He worked with the RAF and trained as a meteorologist, before joining the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey to work in Antarctica. \"He was obsessed with Scott's diaries,\" David says, referring to Captain Robert Scott who was one of the first men to reach the South Pole and died on an expedition in 1912. Dennis went to Antarctica in 1958. He was stationed for a two-year assignment at Admiralty Bay, a small UK base with about 12 men on King George Island, which is roughly 120 kilometres (75 miles) off the northern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nRussell Thompson Men at the base on King George Island relied on sledges and dogs to get around the harsh terrain\n\nThe British Antarctic Survey keeps meticulous records and its archivist Ieuan Hopkins has dug out detailed base camp reports about Dennis's work and antics on the harsh and \"ridiculously isolated\" island. Reading aloud, Mr Hopkins says: \"He's cheerful and industrious, with a mischievous sense of humour and fondness for practical jokes.\"\n\nRussell Thompson Dennis Bell (on the left) was known for his sense of humour - he is re-enacting an advert on the snow in this picture\n\nDennis's job was to send up meteorological weather balloons and radio the reports to the UK every three hours, which involved firing up a generator in sub-zero conditions. Described as the best cook in the hut, he was in charge of the food store over the winter when no supplies could reach them. Antarctica felt even more cut off than it is today, with extremely limited contact with home. David recalls recording a Christmas message at BBC studios with his parents and sister Valerie to be sent to his brother. He was best known for his love of the husky dogs used to pull sledges around the island, and he raised two litters of dogs.\n\nBritish Antarctic Survey Dennis Bell, on the left, with dogs at the Admiralty Bay Station in 1959\n\nHe was also involved in surveying King George Island to produce some of the first mapping of the largely unexplored place. It was on a surveying trip that the accident happened, a few weeks after his 25th birthday. On 26 July 1959, in the deep Antarctic winter, Dennis and a man called Jeff Stokes left the base to climb and survey a glacier. Accounts in the British Antarctic Survey records explain what happened next and the desperate attempts to rescue him. The snow was deep and the dogs had started to show signs of tiredness. Dennis went on ahead alone to encourage them, but he wasn't wearing his skis. Suddenly he disappeared into a crevasse, leaving a hole behind him.\n\nAccording to the accounts, Jeff Stokes called into the depths and Dennis was able to shout back. He grabbed onto a rope that was lowered down. The dogs pulled on the rope and Dennis was hitched up to the lip of the hole. But he had tied the rope onto his belt, perhaps because of the angle he lay in. As he reached the lip, the belt broke and he fell again. His friend called again, but this time Dennis didn't reply. \"That's a story I shall never get over,\" says David.\n\nThe base camp reports about the accident are business-like. \"We heard from Jeff […] that yesterday Tink fell down a crevasse and was killed. We hope to return tomorrow, sea ice permitting,\" it continues. Mr Hopkins explains that another man, called Alan Sharman, had died weeks earlier, and the morale was very low. \"The sledge has got back. We heard the sad details. Jeff has badly bitten frostbitten hands. We are not taking any more risks to recover,\" the report reads the day after the accident. Reading the reports again, Mr Hopkins discovered that earlier in the season, it had been Dennis who'd made the coffin for Alan Sharman.\n\nRussell Thompson Dennis Bell (left) and Jeff Stokes (right) photographed before the accident. Jeff Stokes died five weeks ago before hearing the news that Dennis's remains had been found.\n\n\"My mother never really got over it. She couldn't handle photographs of him and couldn't talk about him,\" David says. He recalls that two men on Dennis's base visited the family, bringing a sheepskin as a gesture. \"But there was no conclusion. There was no service; there was no anything. Just Dennis gone,\" David says.\n\nBritish Antarctic Survey Dennis Bell died near Point Thomas in Admiralty Bay\n\nAbout 15 years ago, David was contacted by Rod Rhys Jones, chair of the British Antarctic Monument Trust. Since 1944, 29 people have died working on British Antarctic Territory on scientific missions, according to the trust. Rod was organising a voyage for relatives of some of the 29 to see the spectacular and remote place where their loved ones had lived and died. David joined the expedition, called South 2015. \"The captain stopped at the locations and give four or five hoots of the siren,\" he says. The sea-ice was too thick for David to reach his brother's hut on King George Island. \"But it was very, very moving. It lifted the pressure, a weight off my head, as it were,\" he says. It gave him a sense of closure. \"And I thought that would be it,\" he says.\n\nDariusz Puczko Scientists found Dennis's remains by the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station\n\nBut on 29 January this year, a team of Polish researchers working from the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station stumbled across something practically on their doorstep. Dennis had been found. Some bones were in the loose ice and rocks deposited at the foot of Ecology Glacier on King George Island. Others were found on the glacier surface. The scientists explain that fresh snowfall was imminent, and they put down a GPS marker so their \"fellow polar colleague\" would not be lost again.\n\nDariusz Puczko Researchers at the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station carefully recorded the remains\n\nA team of scientists made up of Piotr Kittel, Paulina Borówka and Artur Ginter at University of Lodz, Dariusz Puczko at the Polish Academy of Sciences and fellow researcher Artur Adamek carefully rescued the remains in four trips. It is a dangerous and unstable place, \"criss-crossed with crevasses\", and with slopes of up to 45 degrees, according to the Polish team. Climate change is causing dramatic changes to many Antarctic glaciers, including Ecology Glacier, which is undergoing intense melting.\n\n\"The place where Dennis was found is not the same as the place where he went missing,\" the team explains. \"Glaciers, under the influence of gravity, move their mass of ice, and with it, Dennis made his journey,\" they say. Fragments of bamboo ski poles, remains of an oil lamp, glass containers for cosmetics, and fragments from military tents were also collected. \"Every effort was made to ensure that Dennis could return home,\" the team say. \"It's an opportunity to reassess the contribution these men made, and an opportunity to promote science and what we've done in the Antarctic over many decades,\" adds Rod Rhys Jones.\n\nDariusz Puczko Many of Antarctica's glaciers are receding leaving behind rocky material and exposing material trapped inside",
