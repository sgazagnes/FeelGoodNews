      "title": "Europa’s ice may be feeding a hidden ocean that could support life",
      "summary": "Europa’s subsurface ocean might be getting fed after all. Scientists found that salty, nutrient-rich surface ice can become heavy enough to break free and sink through Europa’s icy shell, delivering essential ingredients to the ocean below. The process is fast, repeatable, and works under many conditions. It offers a promising new explanation for how Europa could support life.",
      "content": "A new study from geophysicists at Washington State University sheds light on how nutrients could travel from the surface of Europa into the moon's hidden ocean. Europa, one of Jupiter's largest moons, is considered one of the most promising places in the solar system to search for extraterrestrial life.\n\nFor years, scientists have struggled to explain how life-supporting materials might move from Europa's surface down to its ocean, which is sealed beneath a thick layer of ice. Researchers used computer simulations inspired by a geological process on Earth called crustal delamination. Their models suggest that dense ice packed with nutrients can break away from surrounding ice and slowly sink through the shell until it reaches the ocean below.\n\n\"This is a novel idea in planetary science, inspired by a well-understood idea in Earth science,\" said Austin Green, lead author and postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Tech. \"Most excitingly, this new idea addresses one of the longstanding habitability problems on Europa and is a good sign for the prospects of extraterrestrial life in its ocean.\"\n\nWhy Europa's Ocean Poses a Habitability Puzzle\n\nThe research was published in The Planetary Science Journal and authored by Green, who completed much of the work during his doctoral studies at WSU, along with Catherine Cooper, an associate professor of geophysics in the School of Environment and associate dean in the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nEuropa holds more liquid water than all of Earth's oceans combined. However, that vast ocean sits beneath an icy shell so thick it blocks sunlight entirely. Without sunlight, any life in Europa's ocean would need alternative sources of energy and nutrients, raising long-standing questions about whether the environment could actually support living organisms.\n\nAdding to the complexity, Europa is constantly exposed to intense radiation from Jupiter. This radiation reacts with salts and other materials on the moon's surface, producing compounds that could serve as nutrients for microbes. While scientists know these nutrients exist on the surface, it has remained unclear how they could move downward through the ice to reach the ocean. Although Europa's surface is geologically active due to Jupiter's gravitational forces, most of that motion occurs sideways rather than downward, limiting direct exchange between the surface and the ocean.\n\nBorrowing an Idea From Earth's Geology\n\nTo tackle this problem, Green and Cooper turned to Earth for inspiration. They focused on crustal delamination, a process in which sections of Earth's crust become compressed, chemically altered, and dense enough to detach and sink into the mantle below.\n\nThe researchers believed a similar process could occur on Europa. Certain areas of Europa's ice shell contain high concentrations of salt, which increases the density of the ice. Previous research has also shown that impurities weaken the structure of ice crystals, making them less stable than pure ice. For delamination to occur, this weakened ice would need to break free and sink deeper into the ice shell.\n\nHow Dense Ice Could Feed Europa's Ocean\n\nThe team proposed that heavy, salt-rich ice embedded within purer ice could slowly descend through the shell, recycling surface material and delivering nutrients to the ocean. Their computer models showed that this sinking could occur across a wide range of salt levels, as long as the surface ice experiences even modest weakening.\n\nAccording to the simulations, the process could happen relatively quickly on geological timescales and repeat over long periods. That makes it a potentially steady and reliable way to transport nutrients into Europa's ocean, improving the chances that life could survive there.\n\nRelevance to NASA's Europa Clipper Mission\n\nThese findings align closely with the goals of NASA's Europa Clipper mission, which launched in 2024. The spacecraft is designed to study Europa's ice shell, subsurface ocean, and overall habitability using a suite of scientific instruments.\n\nThe research was supported in part by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Grant NNX15AH91G and relied on computing resources from the Center for Institutional Research Computing at Washington State University.",

      "content": "At the heart of our own galaxy, there is a dense thicket of stars with a supermassive black hole at the very center. NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide the deepest-ever view of this zone, revealing stars, planets, and unique objects that resist definition.\n\nBased on the input of astronomers from across the globe, the Roman Space Telescope will spend three-quarters of its five-year primary mission conducting three revolutionary surveys of unprecedented scale. Their combined results will transform all areas of astronomy and answer longstanding questions about dark matter, dark energy, and planets outside of our solar system, called exoplanets.\n\nThat last theme will be addressed by the Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey, which will peer into the center of our galaxy to study the stars and exoplanets that make up the densely populated region around the center of the Milky Way, known as the galactic bulge.\n\nThis infographic describes the Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey that will be conducted by NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The smallest of Roman’s core surveys, this observation program will consist of repeat visits to six fields covering 1.7 square degrees total. One field will pierce the very center of the galaxy, and the others will be nearby — all in a region of the sky that will be visible to Roman for two 72-day stretches each spring and fall. The survey will mainly consist of six seasons (three early on, and three toward the end of Roman’s primary mission), during which Roman will view each field every 12 minutes. Roman will also view the six fields with less intensity at other times throughout the mission, allowing astronomers to detect microlensing events that can last for years, signaling the presence of isolated, stellar-mass black holes. Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThe survey will observe six patches of the galactic bulge, one pinpointing the center and five nearby, every 12 minutes during 438 days of total observing time. The observations will be separated into six “seasons” spread out over five years.\n\nSpending so much time focusing on a relatively small area of the sky, the mission will be able to track changes in the motion and light of hundreds of millions of stars, and any planets that orbit them, over long periods — the “time-domain” aspect of the survey.\n\n“This survey will be the highest precision, highest cadence, longest continuous observing baseline survey of our galactic bulge, where the highest density of stars in our galaxy reside,” said Jessie Christiansen of Caltech/IPAC, who served as co-chair of the committee that defined the Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey.\n\nExoplanet microlensing\n\nRoman will use a method called microlensing to search for exoplanets, a technique that has so far identified just over 200 exoplanets, compared to more than 4,000 discovered with the transit method, out of the greater than 6,000 currently confirmed.\n\nWith this survey, scientists expect to see over 1,000 new planets orbiting other stars just using microlensing alone. This would increase the number of exoplanets identified using this method by more than fivefold.\n\nA microlensing event is when light from a distant star in the background is warped slightly by a foreground object, like a star and its planet. This warping of light is called gravitational lensing, with the gravity from the star and planet bending the fabric of space that light is traveling through and focusing it like a magnifying glass.\n\nThis animation illustrates the concept of gravitational microlensing. When one star in the sky appears to pass nearly in front of another, the light rays of the background source star become bent due to the warped space-time around the foreground star. This star is then a virtual magnifying glass, amplifying the brightness of the background source star, so we refer to the foreground star as the lens star. If the lens star harbors a planetary system, then those planets can also act as lenses, each one producing a short deviation in the brightness of the source. Thus we discover the presence of exoplanets, and measure its mass and separation from its star.\n\nCredit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center/CI Lab\n\nWhile the transit method is very good at identifying exoplanets that orbit close to their star, the microlensing method can discover exoplanets that orbit farther away from their star, and in planetary systems farther from Earth than ever studied before. Roman will be versatile enough to see exoplanets dwelling from the inner edge of the habitable zone out to great distances from their stars, with a wide range of masses from planets smaller than Mars to the size of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. It may even discover “rogue planets” without host stars that either formed alone or were ejected from their host systems long ago.\n\n“For the first time, we will have a big picture understanding of Earth and our solar system within the broader context of the exoplanet population of the Milky Way galaxy,” Christiansen said. “We still don’t know how common Earth-like planets are, and the Roman Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey will provide us with this answer.”\n\nThis survey will create a census of exoplanets for scientists to draw statistical conclusions from, revealing common patterns found in exoplanets and furthering our understanding of planetary formation and habitability.\n\nOne survey; lots of science\n\nBecause of the immense amount of observing time and subsequent data produced, the Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey will advance not only the field of exoplanet microlensing, but other areas of astronomy, too.\n\n“There is an incredibly rich diversity of science that can be done with a high-precision, high-cadence survey like this one,” said Dan Huber of the University of Hawaii, the other survey co-chair.\n\nThe core survey was optimized not only for microlensing, but also to observe changes in brightness from small, fast blips to long-term trends. This property allows astronomers to discover and characterize transiting planets, red giant stars, stellar-mass black holes and other stellar remnants, and eclipsing binaries, and can lead to a deeper understanding about the physics of star formation and evolution.\n\nA simulated image of Roman’s observations toward the center of our galaxy, spanning only less than 1 percent of the total area of Roman’s galactic bulge time-domain survey. The simulated stars were drawn from the Besançon Galactic Model. Credit: Matthew Penny (Louisiana State University)\n\n“The stars in the bulge and center of our galaxy are unique and not yet well understood,” Huber said. “The data from this survey will allow us to measure how old these stars are and how they fit into the formation history of our Milky Way galaxy.”\n\nRoman’s observing strategy in the Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey, as well as the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey and the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey, will allow astronomers to maximize scientific output, all with one telescope.\n\nAbundance of data to explore\n\nRoman will observe hundreds of millions of stars every 12 minutes during the survey period, providing an unprecedented volume of data for astronomers to parse through.\n\nThe Roman Science Support Center at Caltech/IPAC in Pasadena, California, will be responsible for the high-level science data processing for the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, including exoplanet microlensing and general community outreach for Roman exoplanet science. The Science Support Center’s monitoring of these stars has been automated to detect microlensing and variable events within the data. This helps scientists understand features like how frequently a star’s brightness is changing, or if there are planets lurking near the lensed stars, or other sources of variability. The number of stars and frequency of the observations make the Roman data an ideal dataset for finding such sources.\n\nAll Roman observations will be made publicly available after a short processing period. The mission is scheduled to launch no later than May 2027, with the team on track for launch in fall 2026.\n\nThe Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is managed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, with participation by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California; Caltech/IPAC in Pasadena, California; the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore; and a science team comprising scientists from various research institutions.

      "content": "British particle physicist Mark Thomson is director-general of CERN.Credit: CERN\n\nLast month, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory, CERN, announced that it had secured private donations worth an unprecedented €860 million (US$1 billion) towards the cost of building a future collider of epic proportions.\n\nThe 91-kilometre Future Circular Collider (FCC), which would span the French–Swiss border and pass beneath Lake Geneva, is forecast to cost around 15 billion Swiss francs (US$19 billion) to make — if it gets built. The machine has the backing of the European Strategy Group, a group appointed by CERN’s council to gather input from its member states and the physics community. But CERN has yet to secure full funding for the project, which would smash together electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons, from around 2045.\n\nNature spoke to CERN’s new director-general, Mark Thomson, a British physicist who assumed the position on 1 January, about what the philanthropic cash injection — from the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation and others — means for the FCC, why he thinks the collider should be built and what to expect from his tenure.\n\nThis $1-billion commitment is by far CERN’s biggest-ever philanthropic investment. How did it come about?\n\nA lot of that was the result of the hard work of the previous director-general, Fabiola Gianotti. I’ve yet to meet the people investing, but I will. The thing that’s impressed me most is that these are no-strings-attached pledges. They really are there to support humanity’s quest to understand the Universe.\n\nHow do you make sure of that?\n\nIn the past year or so at CERN, we put in place internal governance around charitable donations. There’s significant due diligence in there, and these agreements are looked at by our council.\n\nWill the extra money help to reduce the contributions required from member states?\n\nAbsolutely. About half of the cost of building the FCC fits within the existing CERN budget, so we need to find additional resources of about 7 billion Swiss francs. Some of that could, but doesn’t necessarily have to, come from increases in member-state contributions. Or it could come from philanthropic contributions. In the European Union’s draft Multiannual Financial Framework budget for 2028 to 2034, there’s also a figure for “moonshot” projects that could be up to €3 billion. And, of course, there are our non-member-state partners. We need to really work on putting the pieces together to get to the point where we will be able to, hopefully, convince our member states that we have the money and that this is the right thing to do.\n\nIn the scientific community, there are those who feel that alternatives to the FCC haven’t been fully explored. What do you say to that?\n\nWe are just coming out of a long European strategy process for particle physics, where communities have come together in scientifically driven meetings, to discuss the scientific priorities.\n\nAlmost every one of our member states and associate member states — their scientific communities — recommended the FCC as the preferred choice for what CERN should do next. That was considering possible alternatives, as well. Scientifically, there’s a big gap between what the FCC can do and what anything else can do. I think only one of the countries was on the fence. That’s really unusual in science.\n\nSome researchers say that CERN should pursue cheaper, more varied experimental strategies instead. What do you think?\n\nYou absolutely need a range of experiments. I think we will always need colliders to push that high-energy frontier. But there are other complementary experiments, for example, direct searches for dark matter, that are also important. We have to pursue them all in parallel and, just like an investment portfolio, some things will be at the lower cost end, and some things will be at the higher end.\n\nCERN also hopes to build a follow-up to the FCC, in the same tunnel, that would collide protons until around 2095. Does it make sense to commit to one experiment type for the rest of the century?",

This is the largest philanthropic gift CERN has ever gotten. The money will help pay for the FCC, which is expected to cost about $19 billion and aims to start working around 2045.\n\n**Impact** – This donation is important because it lowers the amount of money CERN needs from its member countries and shows strong support for the project. The FCC would smash electrons and positrons together to explore new physics beyond what current machines can do.

Credit: NASA\n\nA new NASA study of its Apollo lunar soils clarifies the Moon’s record of meteorite impacts and timing of water delivery. These findings place upper bounds on how much water meteorites could have supplied later in Earth’s history.\n\nResearch has previously shown that meteorites may have been a significant source of Earth’s water as they bombarded our planet early in the solar system’s development. In a paper published Tuesday in the Proceedings to the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Tony Gargano, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Johnson Space Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), both in Houston, used a novel method for analyzing the dusty debris that covers the Moon’s surface called regolith. They learned that even under generous assumptions, meteorite delivery since about four billion years ago could only have supplied a small fraction of Earth’s water.\n\nThe Moon serves as an ancient archive of the impact history the Earth-Moon system has experienced over billions of years. Where Earth’s dynamic crust and weather erase such records, lunar samples preserve them. The records don’t come without challenge, though. Traditional methods of studying regolith have relied on analyzing metal-loving elements. These elements can get muddied by repeated impacts on the Moon, making it harder to untangle and reconstruct what the original meteoroids contained.\n\nEnter triple oxygen isotopes, high precision “fingerprints” that take advantage of the fact that oxygen, the dominant element by mass in rocks, is unaffected by impact or other external forces. The isotopes offer a clearer understanding of the composition of meteorites that impacted the Earth-Moon system. The oxygen-isotope measurements revealed that at least ~1% by mass of the regolith contained material from carbon-rich meteorites that were partially vaporized when they hit the Moon. Using the known properties of such meteorites allowed the team to calculate the amount of water that would have been carried within.\n\n“The lunar regolith is one of the rare places we can still interpret a time-integrated record of what was hitting Earth’s neighborhood for billions of years,” said Gargano. “The oxygen-isotope fingerprint lets us pull an impactor signal out of a mixture that’s been melted, vaporized, and reworked countless times.”\n\nThe findings have implications for our understanding of water sources on Earth and the Moon. When scaled up by roughly 20 times to account for the substantially higher rate of impacts on Earth, the cumulative water shown in the model made up only a small percent of the water in Earth’s oceans. That makes it difficult to reconcile the hypothesis that late delivery of water-rich meteorites was the dominant source of Earth’s water.\n\n“Our results don’t say meteorites delivered no water,” added co-author Justin Simon, a planetary scientist at NASA Johnson’s Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Division. “They say the Moon’s long-term record makes it very hard for late meteorite delivery to be the dominant source of Earth’s oceans.”\n\nFor the Moon, the implied delivery since about 4 billion years ago is tiny on an Earth-ocean scale but is not insignificant for the Moon. The Moon’s accessible water inventory is concentrated in small, permanently shadowed regions at the North and South Poles. These are some of the coldest spots in the solar system and introduce unique opportunities for scientific discovery and potential resources for lunar exploration when NASA lands astronauts on the Moon through Artemis III and beyond.\n\nThe samples analyzed for this study came from parts of the Moon near the equator on the side of the Moon facing Earth, where all six Apollo missions landed. The rocks and dust collected more than 50 years ago continue to reveal new insights but are constrained to a small portion of the Moon. Samples delivered through Artemis will open the door for a new generation of discoveries for decades to come.\n\n“I’m part of the next generation of Apollo scientists —people who didn’t fly the missions, but who were trained on the samples and the questions Apollo made possible,” said Gargano. “The value of the Moon is that it gives us ground truth: real, physical material we can measure in the lab and use to anchor what we infer from orbital data and telescopes. I can’t wait to see what the Artemis samples have to teach us and the next generation about our place in the solar system.”\n\nFor more information on NASA’s Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Division, visit:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/astromaterials\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\n\nHeadquarters, Washington\n\n240-285-5155 / 240-419-1732\n\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov\n\nVictoria Segovia\n\nNASA’s Johnson Space Center\n\n281-483-5111\n\nvictoria.segovia@nasa.gov",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long wondered how Earth got its water. One idea is that meteorites, space rocks that hit Earth and the Moon, brought water during the early history of the solar system. The Moon’s surface keeps a record of these impacts because, unlike Earth, it doesn’t have weather or moving plates to erase the evidence.\n\n**What happened** – NASA researchers studied soil samples from the Apollo missions, which collected dust and rocks from the Moon’s surface. They used a special method looking at oxygen isotopes—different forms of oxygen atoms—to identify materials from meteorites mixed in the lunar soil. Their analysis showed that meteorites contributed only a small amount of water to the Moon since about four billion years ago. By comparing the Moon’s impact record to Earth’s, they estimated meteorites could only explain a small fraction of Earth’s ocean water.\n\n**Impact** – This finding challenges the idea that meteorites were the main source of Earth’s water. It means we need to look for other sources or processes that brought most of our water. For the Moon, even a small amount of water is important because it exists in cold, shadowed places near the poles and could help future astronauts explore and live there.\n\n**What's next step** – NASA plans to bring back new samples from the Moon’s poles with upcoming Artemis missions. These fresh samples will help scientists learn more about the Moon’s water and how Earth and the Moon formed. It will also guide future space exploration by showing where water resources might be found.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – NASA’s study of Moon soil shows meteorites brought only a small part of Earth’s water, pointing to other sources and aiding future lunar exploration.\n",
