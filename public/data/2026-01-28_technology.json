      "content": "Chemist Omar Yaghi invented materials called MOFs, a few grams of which have the surface area of a football field. He explains why he thinks these super-sponges will define the next century\n\nChristopher Michel/Contour RA by Getty Images\n\nCivilisations name their ages after materials. In school, we learn about the Stone Age, the Bronze Age – and we are currently in a silicon age characterised by computers and phones. What might define the next age? Omar Yaghi at the University of California, Berkeley, thinks a family of materials he helped pioneer in the 1990s has a good shot. They are metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and working out how to make them earned him a share of the 2025 Nobel prize in chemistry.\n\nMOFs, and their cousins covalent organic frameworks (COFs), are crystalline materials, but what sets them apart is their incredible porosity. In 1999, Yaghi and his colleagues made a splash when they synthesised a zinc-based material called MOF-5 that was so riddled with pores that a couple of grams of it had an internal surface area comparable to a football field (see diagram below). The inside of the material was effectively an awful lot larger than its outside.\n\nFor decades, Yaghi has been at the forefront of making new MOFs and COFs, a discipline known as reticular chemistry, and working out just how useful they can be. Because other molecules can be sucked into these materials’ abundant pores, they turn out to be great at harvesting water from arid desert air, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and much more. Yaghi spoke to New Scientist about why he is optimistic about this work, the past, present and future of reticular chemistry – and why he thinks the age of these materials is dawning.\n\nKarmela Padavic-Callaghan: What originally grabbed you about reticular chemistry?\n\nOmar Yaghi: When we started working with MOFs, we didn’t think we would be addressing societal challenges – it was an intellectual challenge. We wanted to find a way to make materials one molecule at a time, like constructing a building, or programming molecules like Lego. But this was a really formidable chemistry challenge. For many people, it was taken as an article of faith that this would not work, that pursuing it was a waste of time.\n\nWhy did designing materials in this way seem so impossible?\n\nThe main challenge with building materials in a rational way is that, typically, when you mix the chemical building blocks, you end up with them joining together in a way that is disordered and hard to characterise. This is not surprising given the laws of physics that tell us that nature tends towards high entropy or disorder. Instead, we wanted to end up with crystals, with ordered matter that has a repeated, periodic structure.\n\nIt’s a bit like asking a room of kids to make a perfect circle: it takes hard work, and when they do it, they can still dissociate or “un-hold” hands and then take too long to complete the circle again. To put it another way, we were trying to do what nature does when it crystallises diamonds over the course of billions of years – but in a day. But I knew deep down inside that anything can be crystallised if you know how.\n\nIn 1999, your instincts were proven right and your team reported on the synthesis of MOF-5, which was unprecedentedly stable. Did you anticipate that a material like it could eventually become useful?\n\nWe identified a solvent that could help synthesise stable MOFs and were then able to understand how it worked. We realised that having its molecules in the mix was absolutely crucial for modulating the tendency towards disorder. Thousands of researchers have used this method since.\n\nAt the beginning, I was just excited to make beautiful crystals. Then we saw their great properties and could say, “Wow, what can we do with this?” And once you know how much porosity these materials have, you immediately think about trapping gases. These materials encompass compartments of space where a molecule of water or carbon dioxide or something else can sit.\n\nTell me about how you think about making these materials these days.\n\nWhen I’m cooking, I don’t like having to do more than three steps, and I don’t use butter. So, the challenge is how to get a master dish in so few steps and only use healthy ingredients. This philosophy also spilled into my chemistry. In other words, I want to keep the process simple and only use the chemicals we really need.\n\nThe first step is choosing the backbone of the material. The second is deciding on the size of its pores. You can also do chemistry on the skeleton and add molecules to it, to help capture other compounds into the pores. The third step is to let carbon dioxide or whatever you built the material for get sucked in. That’s how easy and how complex the process is.\n\nWhat sort of new technologies has this process allowed you to pursue?\n\nOnce you learn how to design materials at the molecular level, that’s the ultimate achievement, a geologic shift. My vision, and the vision for the company I founded in 2020, Atoco, is to go from the molecule to society, to look at places where there is no material for some task or it is doing it badly, then rationally design a better one. As we become better at making materials, we will improve societal standards.\n\nIn 2024, we reported the best yet material for capturing carbon dioxide, called COF-999. It captures it from air and we tested it for more than 100 cycles of capturing then [expelling] carbon dioxide here in Berkeley. Atoco aims to use reticular materials such as COF-999 to build carbon-capture modules that could operate in industrial settings, but also in residential buildings.\n\nWe have also developed materials that can capture thousands of litres of water per day from the atmosphere. This is the basis for our devices that can extract water vapour from air even in places where humidity is lower than 20 per cent, such as desert areas in Nevada. I think in 10 years, water harvesting will be everyday technology.\n\nMOFs have a crystalline structure that is riddled with tiny internal pores EYE OF SCIENCE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n\nThere are other technologies that can capture water, such as devices that condense atmospheric vapours, and there are other devices that can capture CO2, too. How do MOFs and COFs compare?\n\nWe have so much control over the chemistry that we can make our devices in a sustainable fashion. They could work for many, many years, and at the end of the journey of the MOF part of the device, you can disassemble it in water in such a way that no MOF escapes into the environment. So, in a world where MOFs are scaled to multi-tonne levels and used in many different applications, we will not face a “MOF waste problem”.\n\nAnd these devices can be a lot more energy-efficient because we worked out, for example, how to use ambient sunlight to make water harvesters release water. For carbon-capture devices, we could also use waste heat from industrial processes [to get them to release CO2], which would make them more economical and sustainable than competing technologies.\n\nBut there are still challenges with scalability, making materials chemically stable and having precise control over how and when they release the molecules that they suck in from the environment. For instance, we can already make MOFs at the scale of tonnes, but we cannot yet make COFs in such large quantities. Within a few years, I suspect that we will go bigger. As another example, for even better water harvesting, we need to optimise how materials hold onto the water – it cannot be too strong nor too weak.\n\nWe are now also using artificial intelligence agents to help optimise MOFs and COFs and make the design process as efficient as possible. It is, in general, easy to make a MOF or a COF, but it can take a year to make one with specifically optimised properties. If an AI agent can do it more quickly, that would be transformational. I went into the lab and told everyone to try using large language models and we already doubled the rate at which we can make some new MOFs.\n\nWhat are the uses for reticular chemistry that you think more people should be excited about?\n\nReticular chemistry is currently a massive field: millions of new MOFs can still be made, and chemists are behaving a little like children in a candy shop. One attractive idea is using MOFs to do what enzymes do when they speed up chemical reactions, a process called catalysis, which can help synthesise useful chemicals, such as in drug development. We have MOFs that can do what enzymes can do, but they could last and work for longer than enzymes. This is ripe to be exploited for biological applications, for therapeutics, in the next decade or so.\n\nBut I think the next-best use cases will come from “multivariate materials”, which is research that you don’t hear much about because it is only going on in my lab. Here, we want to make MOFs that don’t have the same structure through and through, but have massively different environments within them. We can make them from different modules that are “decorated” with different compounds, so inside the material, there would be very different microenvironments that would make specific molecules do specific things. In experiments, we have already been able to leverage this to make materials that absorb gases more selectively and efficiently. This is also a shift in chemists’ mindsets. Chemists are not used to thinking about making heterogeneous or uneven materials, but we want a very ordered skeleton for a material combined with very heterogeneous guts.\n\nWhat makes you optimistic about the future of MOFs and COFs? “Miracle materials” have come and gone before.\n\nWe have just scratched the surface here and we are not short on ideas. The field has been expanding since the 1990s. Often, research interests decline over time, but that has not happened here, and if you look at the growth in patents related to MOFs and COFs, you also see an exponential increase there. People are still seeing ways not just to solve intellectual challenges in chemistry, but to find new applications and uses for these materials. And I love how this work combines organic and inorganic chemistry into one field, and it is now also bringing in engineering and AI. It’s become more than chemistry: this type of research is a real scientific frontier.\n\nI think we are going through a revolution. It does not always feel like that, but something special is going on. We can design materials like we’ve never done before, and connect them to uses like we have never done before.",

Researchers say functional quantum systems now exist, but scaling them into truly powerful machines will require major advances in engineering and manufacturing. By comparing different quantum platforms, the study reveals both impressive progress and steep challenges ahead. History suggests the payoff could be enormous—but not immediate.",
      "content": "Quantum technology is rapidly moving beyond controlled laboratory experiments and into practical use. According to a new paper published in Science, the field has reached a critical phase that mirrors the early era of classical computing before the invention of the transistor reshaped modern technology.\n\nThe paper was written by researchers from the University of Chicago, Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Innsbruck in Austria, and the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. It examines the current state of quantum information hardware and highlights the key opportunities and obstacles involved in building scalable quantum computers, communication networks, and sensing systems.\n\n\"This transformative moment in quantum technology is reminiscent of the transistor's earliest days,\" said lead author David Awschalom, the Liew Family Professor of molecular engineering and physics at the University of Chicago, and director of the Chicago Quantum Exchange and the Chicago Quantum Institute. \"The foundational physics concepts are established, functional systems exist, and now we must nurture the partnerships and coordinated efforts necessary to achieve the technology's full, utility-scale potential. How will we meet the challenges of scaling and modular quantum architectures?\"\n\nFrom Lab Experiments to Early Real-World Uses\n\nOver the last ten years, quantum technologies have progressed from proof-of-concept experiments to systems capable of supporting early applications in communication, sensing, and computing. The authors attribute this rapid progress to close collaboration among universities, government agencies, and industry, the same mix of partnerships that helped microelectronics mature in the twentieth century.\n\nComparing Today's Quantum Hardware Platforms\n\nThe study reviews six major quantum hardware platforms: superconducting qubits, trapped ions, spin defects, semiconductor quantum dots, neutral atoms, and optical photonic qubits. To compare how far each platform has advanced across computing, simulation, networking, and sensing, the researchers used large language AI models such as ChatGPT and Gemini to estimate technology-readiness levels (TRL).\n\nTRLs measure how mature a technology is, using a scale from 1 (basic principles observed in a lab environment) to 9 (proven in an operational environment). A higher TRL does not necessarily mean a technology is close to widespread use, but rather that it has demonstrated more complete system functionality.\n\nThe analysis provides a snapshot of where the field stands today. While some advanced prototypes can already operate as full systems and are accessible through public cloud platforms, their overall performance remains limited. Many high-impact applications, including large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, could require millions of physical qubits with error rates far beyond what current technology can support.\n\nWhy Technology Readiness Needs Context\n\nEvaluating readiness without historical perspective can be misleading, explained coauthor William D. Oliver, the Henry Ellis Warren (1894) Professor of electrical engineering and computer science, professor of physics, and director of the Center for Quantum Engineering at MIT.\n\n\"While semiconductor chips in the 1970s were TLR-9 for that time, they could do very little compared with today's advanced integrated circuits,\" he said. \"Similarly, a high TRL for quantum technologies today does not indicate that the end goal has been achieved, nor does it indicate that the science is done and only engineering remains. Rather, it reflects a significant, yet relatively modest, system-level demonstration has been achieved -- one that still must be substantially improved and scaled to realize the full promise.\"\n\nScaling Challenges and Lessons From Computing History\n\nAmong the platforms studied, superconducting qubits scored highest for quantum computing, neutral atoms led in quantum simulation, photonic qubits ranked highest for quantum networking, and spin defects performed best for quantum sensing.\n\nThe authors identify several major hurdles that must be overcome for quantum systems to scale effectively. Advances in materials science and fabrication are needed to produce consistent, high-quality devices that can be manufactured reliably and at scale. Wiring and signal delivery remain major engineering challenges, since most platforms still rely on individual control lines for each qubit. Simply adding more wiring becomes impractical as systems move toward millions of qubits. (Similar problems were faced in the 1960s by computer engineers, known as the tyranny of numbers.) Power management, temperature control, automated calibration, and system-level coordination present additional challenges that will grow as quantum systems become more complex.\n\nThe paper draws parallels to the long development timeline of classical electronics. Many transformative breakthroughs, including lithography techniques and new transistor materials, took years or even decades to move from research labs into industrial production. The authors argue that quantum technology is likely to follow a similar path. They stress the need for top-down system design, open scientific collaboration that avoids early fragmentation, and realistic expectations.\n\n\"Patience has been a key element in many landmark developments,\" they write, \"and points to the importance of tempering timeline expectations in quantum technologies.\"",

These patterns closely track the temperature at which the pseudogap forms, suggesting magnetism may help set the stage for superconductivity.",
      "content": "Physicists have identified an unexpected connection between magnetism and the pseudogap, a puzzling phase of matter that appears in some quantum materials just before they become superconducting. This insight could help researchers develop new materials with valuable properties, including high-temperature superconductivity, where electricity travels without energy loss.\n\nThe discovery came from experiments using a quantum simulator cooled to temperatures just above absolute zero. As the system cooled, the researchers observed a consistent pattern in how electrons influence the magnetic orientation of nearby electrons. Since electrons can have spin up or down, these interactions shape the material's overall behavior. The work represents an important step toward explaining unconventional superconductivity and was made possible through a collaboration between experimental physicists at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany and theorists, including Antoine Georges, director of the Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ) at the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute in New York City.\n\nThe international team reported its findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nWhy Superconductivity Remains a Puzzle\n\nSuperconductivity has been studied for decades because of its potential to transform technologies such as long-distance power transmission and quantum computing. Despite this effort, scientists still lack a complete understanding of how superconductivity arises, especially in materials that operate at relatively high temperatures.\n\nIn many high-temperature superconductors, the superconducting state does not emerge directly from an ordinary metallic phase. Instead, the material first passes through an intermediate stage known as the pseudogap. During this phase, electrons behave in unusual ways, and fewer electronic states are available for current to flow. Because of this, understanding the pseudogap is widely seen as essential for uncovering the mechanisms behind superconductivity and improving material performance.\n\nMagnetism Under Pressure From Doping\n\nWhen a material contains the normal number of electrons, those electrons tend to organize into a well-ordered magnetic pattern called antiferromagnetism. In this arrangement, neighboring electron spins point in opposite directions, much like a carefully synchronized left right sequence.\n\nThis orderly pattern breaks down when electrons are removed through a process known as doping. For many years, scientists believed that doping completely eliminated long-range magnetic order. The new PNAS study challenges that assumption by showing that at extremely low temperatures, a subtle form of organization survives beneath the apparent disorder. These experiments were guided by earlier theoretical work on the pseudogap carried out at the CCQ, which led to a 2024 paper in Science.\n\nSimulating Quantum Matter With Ultracold Atoms\n\nTo explore this behavior, the research team used the Fermi-Hubbard model, a widely accepted theoretical framework that describes how electrons interact within a solid. Rather than studying actual materials, the researchers recreated the model using lithium atoms cooled to billionths of a degree above absolute zero. These atoms were arranged in a carefully controlled optical lattice created with laser light.\n\nUltracold atom quantum simulators allow scientists to reproduce complex material behavior under conditions that traditional solid-state experiments cannot achieve. Using a quantum gas microscope, which can image individual atoms and detect their magnetic orientation, the team collected more than 35,000 detailed snapshots. These images captured both the positions of atoms and their magnetic correlations across a broad range of temperatures and doping levels.\n\n\"It is remarkable that quantum analog simulators based on ultracold atoms can now be cooled down to temperatures where intricate quantum collective phenomena show up,\" says Georges.\n\nA Universal Magnetic Pattern Emerges\n\nThe data revealed a striking result. \"Magnetic correlations follow a single universal pattern when plotted against a specific temperature scale,\" explains lead author Thomas Chalopin of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics. \"And this scale is comparable to the pseudogap temperature, the point at which the pseudogap emerges.\" This means the pseudogap is closely tied to subtle magnetic structures that persist beneath what initially appears to be disorder.\n\nThe study also showed that electron interactions in this regime are more complex than simple pairings. Instead, electrons form larger, multiparticle correlated structures. Even a single dopant can disrupt magnetic order across a surprisingly wide area. Unlike earlier research that focused only on pairs of electrons, this study measured correlations involving up to five particles at once, a level of detail achieved by only a small number of laboratories worldwide.\n\nRevealing Hidden Correlations\n\nFor theorists, these findings provide an important new benchmark for models of the pseudogap. More broadly, the results bring scientists closer to understanding how high-temperature superconductivity emerges from the collective motion of interacting, dancing electrons. \"By revealing the hidden magnetic order in the pseudogap, we are uncovering one of the mechanisms that may ultimately be related to superconductivity,\" Chalopin explains.\n\nThe work also highlights the importance of close cooperation between theory and experiment. By combining precise theoretical predictions with carefully controlled quantum simulations, the researchers were able to uncover patterns that would otherwise remain hidden.\n\nThis international effort brought together experimental and theoretical expertise, and future experiments aim to cool the system even further, search for additional forms of order, and develop new ways to observe quantum matter from fresh perspectives.\n\n\"Analog quantum simulations are entering a new and exciting stage, which challenges the classical algorithms that we develop at CCQ,\" says Georges. \"At the same time, those experiments require guidance from theory and classical simulations. Collaboration between theorists and experimentalists is more important than ever.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Superconductivity is a special state where electricity flows without losing energy. Before some materials become superconductors, they enter a mysterious phase called the pseudogap, where electrons behave unusually. Understanding this phase is important for discovering how superconductivity works, especially at higher temperatures.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from Germany and the US used a quantum simulator cooled to near absolute zero to study how electrons interact in this pseudogap phase. Instead of using real materials, they recreated the system with ultracold lithium atoms trapped by laser light. They took over 35,000 detailed pictures showing how the atoms’ magnetic orientations align. The team found that even when normal magnetic order seems lost, a hidden pattern of magnetism remains and matches the temperature where the pseudogap appears.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery shows that magnetism plays a subtle but important role in the pseudogap phase, which was not fully understood before. It challenges the old idea that magnetism disappears completely when materials are doped (when electrons are removed). Finding these hidden magnetic patterns helps scientists better understand how superconductivity starts and could guide the creation of new materials that conduct electricity without loss at higher temperatures.\n\n**What's next step** – The team plans to cool the system even more to see if other forms of order appear and to develop new ways to study quantum materials. This research relies on close cooperation between theorists and experimentalists, combining theory with advanced quantum simulations to reveal hidden behaviors.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Using ultracold atoms, scientists found hidden magnetic patterns tied to the pseudogap phase, shedding light on how superconductivity begins.",

Avant que certains matériaux deviennent supraconducteurs, ils passent par une phase mystérieuse appelée pseudogap, où les électrons se comportent de façon inhabituelle. Comprendre cette phase est important pour découvrir comment fonctionne la supraconductivité, surtout à des températures plus élevées.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Des chercheurs d'Allemagne et des États-Unis ont utilisé un simulateur quantique refroidi près du zéro absolu pour étudier les interactions entre électrons dans cette phase de pseudogap.

Elle remet en question l'idée ancienne selon laquelle le magnétisme disparaît complètement lorsque le matériau est dopé (lorsque des électrons sont retirés).

      "content": "To get the most out of the sensing revolution, different disciplines need to be on the same wavelength. This is a priority for the Nature Portfolio’s newest journal, Nature Sensors .\n\nDriverless cars rely on sensors that both perceive and respond to their surroundings.Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty\n\nWhat do wearable technologies have in common with driverless cars? And what do observatories peering into outer space have in common with laboratories studying the deepest oceans?\n\nA sense of home\n\nAll use sensing technologies that perceive and respond to their surroundings. There are myriad sensors for detecting electrical signals, motion, pressure, temperature, force, gradients, fingerprints, chemicals and more. Sensor technologies are embedded in our lives, playing a central part in the function of everyday items — mobile phones, smart televisions, induction hobs and smoke detectors, to name but a few. Think of a piece of technology, and there are probably one or more sensors involved. Several estimates suggest that the global market for sensor technologies will exceed US$500 billion within a decade.\n\nThis is a field on the move, and now it has a new journal. Earlier this month, Nature Sensors launched with a mission1 to “convene the global sensing research community to advance discovery, enable real-world impacts and foster a shared scientific home for sensing research”.\n\nFrom simple devices such as the mercury thermometer to super-sensitive instruments such as the laser interferometer LIGO, sensors have a long history. So why does such an established community need convening? The answer lies in the sheer diversity of the sensing technologies that are at the heart of many innovations and scientific discoveries.\n\nThe evolution of science and technology over the past century has been, by some measures, a story of division: the splitting of unitary fields into subfields, and the further subdivision of those subfields into even more specialized disciplines. In the case of sensors, we are, in some ways, seeing the opposite.\n\nAI and the rise of intelligent sensing\n\nThe ‘home’ discipline for sensors, especially in universities, has conventionally been signal processing, which is a branch of electrical and electronic engineering. But today, sensor research incorporates knowledge and methods from across the biological and chemical sciences, as well as the physical sciences, engineering and technology. Its success depends on productive interdisciplinary working.\n\nThe editors of Nature Sensors aim to “connect communities and break down siloes”, and foster a shared sense of purpose across disciplines. The journal will publish primary research, along with news, opinion and analysis from across the field, and will also hold virtual and in-person events. The first of these will be in Seoul on 13 April, focused on the future of sensing technologies (see go.nature.com/4qpivuc).\n\nArtificial intelligence will be central to that future, as a Feature in the launch issue of Nature Sensors shows2. Among the examples described is a project that aims to assist physicians in tracking the rehabilitation of patients who have had throat surgery3. Participants wore sensors that measured variables including vibration and electrical muscle signals. Huanyu Cheng at Pennsylvania State University in University Park and his colleagues found that AI did a better job of organizing and classifying this information than conventional data-processing methods did.\n\nIn another example, Aydogan Ozcan and his colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, improved the resolution of microscopes without physically adapting them. The authors trained an AI model on low- and high-resolution versions of images of tissue samples. After training, low-resolution images could be fed into the model, and it produced higher-resolution versions4.\n\nHow to reduce the environmental impact of wearable health-care devices\n\nBut, as the capabilities and applications of sensors grow, so will their environmental impact. Worldwide, more than 60 million tonnes of electronic waste is generated a year. Some of this will contain sensors. Little more than one-fifth of the waste is collected and recycled responsibly, according to a United Nations report (see go.nature.com/4rgigbb).\n\nTo get a sense of the impact of just one sector, environmental scientist Chuanwang Yang at the University of Chicago in Illinois and his colleagues projected that the ecological footprint of wearable health devices, namely monitors for glucose, blood pressure and heartbeat, will amount to the equivalent of 3.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050. They also found that the devices’ complex miniaturized designs make collection and recycling difficult5. Ways to address waste are sorely needed, and must be a prominent focus for those working with sensors.\n\nHow can researchers from across disciplines better work together to address such challenges and find common solutions? Shared goals offer one point of convergence, as do joint projects and publications. “We need global efforts instead of individual labs or companies driving the field,” says Sami Haddadin, an electrical engineer at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi2. His work in the field of AI sensing and robotics is discussed in the Feature in the launch issue.\n\nThe editors of Nature Sensors hope to play their part in bringing the community together and driving the necessary global conversations. We wish them every bit of good fortune in their mission to support scientifically sound and socially responsible innovation.",
