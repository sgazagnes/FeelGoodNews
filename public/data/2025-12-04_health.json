      "title": "A routine shingles shot may offer powerful defense against dementia",
      "summary": "A unique vaccine rollout in Wales gave researchers an accidental natural experiment that revealed a striking reduction in dementia among seniors who received the shingles vaccine. The protective effect held steady across multiple analyses and was even stronger in women. Evidence also suggests benefits for people who already have dementia, hinting at a therapeutic effect.",
      "content": "An unusual vaccination rule in Wales has given scientists some of the clearest evidence so far that a vaccine might help protect against dementia. In a new study led by Stanford Medicine, researchers examined health records from older adults in Wales and found that people who received the shingles vaccine were 20% less likely to be diagnosed with dementia over the following seven years than those who did not receive the shot.\n\nThe results, published April 2 in Nature, support a growing idea that certain viruses that affect the nervous system may raise the chance of developing dementia. If these findings continue to hold up in future work, they suggest that a practical way to help prevent dementia could already exist.\n\nA second analysis from the same team, published Dec. 2 in Cell, pointed to another potential benefit. In that study, the researchers reported that the vaccine might also help people who already have dementia by slowing how quickly the condition worsens.\n\nShingles virus, chicken pox and lifelong infection\n\nShingles is a viral disease that causes a painful, blistering rash. It is triggered by the same virus that leads to chicken pox -- varicella-zoster. When someone gets chicken pox, usually in childhood, the virus does not fully leave the body. Instead, it stays inactive inside nerve cells for life. In later years, especially in older adults or in people whose immune systems are weakened, this dormant virus can reactivate and cause shingles.\n\nDementia, brain changes and the viral hypothesis\n\nDementia currently affects more than 55 million people worldwide, and about 10 million new cases are diagnosed every year. For many years, most dementia research has centered on abnormal protein build-up in the brain, including plaques and tangles that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, the most common type of dementia. However, these efforts have not yet produced successful ways to prevent or halt the disease, so some scientists have turned their attention to other possible drivers, including infections by specific viruses that may damage the brain over time.\n\nEarlier observational studies using health records had hinted that people who received the shingles vaccine were less likely to develop dementia. However, those studies had a serious limitation. People who choose to get vaccinated are often more health conscious in many ways that are hard to measure. They may eat differently, exercise more or engage with health care more regularly. Those lifestyle differences are known to influence dementia risk but are not recorded in medical databases.\n\n\"All these associational studies suffer from the basic problem that people who go get vaccinated have different health behaviors than those who don't,\" said Pascal Geldsetzer, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine and senior author of the new study. \"In general, they're seen as not being solid enough evidence to make any recommendations on.\"\n\nA rare natural experiment in Wales\n\nAbout two years ago, Geldsetzer noticed an unusual opportunity in the way Wales had rolled out its shingles vaccination program. The setup functioned as what researchers call a \"natural experiment,\" and it appeared to avoid much of the bias seen in earlier work. At that time, the country used a version of the shingles vaccine that contained a live-attenuated, or weakened, form of the virus.\n\nThe national program began on Sept. 1, 2013. Under the policy, anyone who was 79 years old on that date could receive the vaccine during the following year. (People who were 78 would become eligible the next year for one year, and so on.) People who were 80 or older on Sept. 1, 2013, were out of luck -- they would never become eligible for the vaccine.\n\nBecause eligibility depended only on age at a specific cut-off date, the difference between being just under or just over the age threshold had a major impact on who could get the shot. That allowed researchers to compare people who turned 80 shortly before Sept. 1, 2013, with those who turned 80 shortly after, and to see how being eligible for the vaccine changed long-term outcomes.\n\nAccording to Geldsetzer, the detailed health records available in Wales made these circumstances about as close as possible to a randomized controlled trial without actually running one.\n\nComparing nearly identical groups\n\nTo take advantage of this setup, the team analyzed the health records of more than 280,000 older adults between 71 and 88 years old who did not have dementia at the beginning of the vaccination program. They then concentrated their analysis on people whose birthdays placed them just on either side of the eligibility line, comparing those who turned 80 in the week before Sept. 1 to those who turned 80 in the week after.\n\n\"We know that if you take a thousand people at random born in one week and a thousand people at random, born a week later, there shouldn't be anything different about them on average,\" Geldsetzer said. \"They are similar to each other apart from this tiny difference in age.\"\n\nThe researchers reasoned that about the same share of people in both groups would have wanted the shingles shot. The crucial difference was that only the slightly younger group, those not yet 80 on Sept. 1, 2013, were permitted to receive it under the rules.\n\n\"What makes the study so powerful is that it's essentially like a randomized trial with a control group -- those a little bit too old to be eligible for the vaccine -- and an intervention group -- those just young enough to be eligible,\" Geldsetzer said.\n\nMeasuring protection against shingles and dementia\n\nThe team then tracked health outcomes for the next seven years, comparing people of similar ages who had been eligible or ineligible for the vaccine. By combining that information with actual vaccination rates, they could estimate the effect of receiving the shot. About half of the people who were eligible went on to be vaccinated, while almost none of those who were not eligible received it.\n\nAs expected, the vaccine lowered the rate of shingles over the seven-year follow-up by about 37% among those who were vaccinated, in line with clinical trial data. (The live-attenuated vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time.)\n\nBy 2020, when the individuals being studied were around 86 and 87 years old, one in eight had developed dementia. Among those who received the shingles shot, however, the likelihood of a dementia diagnosis was 20% lower compared with those who did not receive it.\n\n\"It was a really striking finding,\" Geldsetzer said. \"This huge protective signal was there, any which way you looked at the data.\"\n\nRuling out other explanations\n\nThe researchers then searched for other factors that might explain the difference in dementia rates. They found that the two groups were extremely similar in all the characteristics they could measure. Education levels were the same for eligible and ineligible people. Those who were eligible for the shingles vaccine were not more likely to receive other vaccines or preventive therapies, and they were not less likely to have common illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease or cancer.\n\nThe only clear difference between the groups was the lower number of dementia diagnoses in those who had access to the shingles shot.\n\n\"Because of the unique way in which the vaccine was rolled out, bias in the analysis is much less likely than would usually be the case,\" Geldsetzer said.\n\nEven so, the team tested the data in a variety of alternative ways, such as examining different age windows or focusing only on deaths that listed dementia as a cause. No matter how they sliced the information, the relationship between vaccination and lower dementia risk remained.\n\n\"The signal in our data was so strong, so clear and so persistent,\" he said.\n\nBenefits from early decline to advanced dementia\n\nThe researchers next asked whether the apparent benefits of the vaccine were limited to preventing dementia, or whether they also extended to people who already showed signs of cognitive problems. Using the same natural experiment structure, they examined a broader range of outcomes, from mild cognitive changes to late-stage dementia.\n\nMany cases of dementia are preceded by a period of mild cognitive impairment -- characterized by deficits in memory and cognitive skills that do not interfere with independent living, Geldsetzer said.\n\nThe team observed that people who had received the shingles vaccine were less likely to receive a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment during a nine-year follow-up period than those who remained unvaccinated.\n\nThey also looked at people who already had dementia at the start of the Welsh vaccination program. In this group, the results were especially striking. Individuals with dementia who received the shingles shot were significantly less likely to die from dementia in the next nine years (as indicated on their death certificates) than those who did not receive the vaccine, suggesting that the disease may have progressed more slowly in the vaccinated group.\n\nIn total, nearly half of the 7,049 Welsh seniors who had dementia when the program began died from dementia during follow-up. Among those with dementia who received the vaccine, only about 30% died from dementia.\n\n\"The most exciting part is that this really suggests the shingles vaccine doesn't have only preventive, delaying benefits for dementia, but also therapeutic potential for those who already have dementia,\" Geldsetzer said.\n\nStronger effects in women raise new questions\n\nAnother notable pattern emerged when the researchers compared outcomes by sex. The protective effect of the shingles vaccine against dementia appeared to be much stronger in women than in men. Geldsetzer noted that this might reflect biological differences in immune responses or differences in how dementia develops in men and women. On average, women tend to develop higher antibody responses after vaccination, and shingles occurs more often in women than in men.\n\nAt this point, scientists still do not know exactly how the vaccine might be providing protection. It is not yet clear whether it works by broadly stimulating the immune system, by reducing how often the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, or through another pathway entirely.\n\nIt is also unknown whether a newer shingles vaccine, which uses only certain proteins from the virus and is more effective at preventing shingles, would have a similar or even stronger effect on dementia risk.\n\nGlobal data and the push for a randomized trial\n\nGeldsetzer hopes these findings will encourage more investment in this line of research.\n\n\"At least investing a subset of our resources into investigating these pathways could lead to breakthroughs in terms of treatment and prevention,\" he said.\n\nOver the past two years, his team has checked health records from other countries, including England, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, where similar shingles vaccine rollouts took place. The results in those datasets have echoed what was seen in Wales. \"We just keep seeing this strong protective signal for dementia in dataset after dataset,\" he said.\n\nThe next step that Geldsetzer is aiming for is a large randomized controlled trial, which would offer the most rigorous evidence on whether the vaccine truly causes the reduction in dementia. In such a study, participants would be randomly assigned to receive either the live-attenuated shingles vaccine or a placebo injection.\n\n\"It would be a very simple, pragmatic trial because we have a one-off intervention that we know is safe,\" he said.\n\nGeldsetzer is seeking philanthropic support to fund this work, in part because the live-attenuated vaccine is now off-patent, even though it is the vaccine type for which he has gathered strong evidence from natural experiments.\n\nHe also pointed out that such a trial might show meaningful results relatively quickly. In the Wales data, when researchers plotted dementia rates for people who were eligible versus ineligible for the vaccine, the two curves began to move apart after about a year and a half.\n\nA researcher from the Vienna University of Economics and Business also contributed to the work.\n\nThe study received funding from The Phil & Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience, the Stanford Center for Digital Health, the National Institute on Aging (grant R01AG084535), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant DP2AI171011) and the Biohub, San Francisco.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Dementia is a brain disease that affects millions worldwide and currently has no sure way to prevent it. Some scientists think that viruses, like the one causing shingles, might play a role in causing dementia. Shingles is caused by a virus that stays in the body after chicken pox and can reactivate later in life.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers studied health records from over 280,000 older adults in Wales who were part of a special shingles vaccine program starting in 2013.

Seules les personnes juste en dessous de 80 ans pouvaient recevoir le vaccin. Les scientifiques ont donc comparé ceux qui étaient éligibles à ceux qui étaient un peu trop âgés. Ils ont découvert que les vaccinés avaient 20 % de chances en moins d’être diagnostiqués avec une démence dans les sept années suivantes. Le vaccin semblait aussi ralentir la progression de la démence chez ceux qui en étaient déjà atteints.\n\n**Impact** – Cette étude est importante car elle a utilisé une situation naturelle rare qui a rendu la comparaison très juste, presque comme une expérience contrôlée. Elle apporte une preuve solide qu’un vaccin courant pourrait réduire le risque de démence et aider ceux qui en souffrent déjà. Les résultats étaient particulièrement forts chez les femmes. Cela suggère que le vaccin contre le zona pourrait avoir des bénéfices au-delà de la prévention du zona.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques souhaitent réaliser un essai contrôlé randomisé, où les participants recevraient au hasard le vaccin ou un placebo, pour confirmer ces résultats. Ils examinent aussi des données similaires d’autres pays et veulent comprendre comment le vaccin protège le cerveau. Un essai réussi pourrait ouvrir la voie à une nouvelle façon de prévenir ou de ralentir la démence.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le vaccin contre le zona pourrait réduire le risque de démence et ralentir sa progression chez les personnes âgées, offrant un nouvel outil prometteur contre cette maladie cérébrale courante.",

      "summary": "A surprising link between constipation and kidney decline led researchers to test lubiprostone, revealing that it can protect kidney function. The results point toward gut-based, mitochondria-boosting therapies as a promising new avenue for CKD care.",
      "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects people across the globe and often progresses to the point where patients rely on routine dialysis to survive. Although the condition is widespread and serious, there are still no approved medications that can actively restore kidney function. A team led by Professor Takaaki Abe at the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine has uncovered an unexpected approach by repurposing a constipation medication. Their work marks the first time that this drug (lubiprostone) has been shown to slow the loss of kidney function in people with CKD.\n\n\"We noticed that constipation is a symptom that often accompanies CKD, and decided to investigate this link further,\" explains Abe. \"Essentially, constipation disrupts the intestinal microbiota, which worsens kidney function. Working backwards, we hypothesized that we could improve kidney function by treating constipation.\"\n\nClinical Trial Shows Lubiprostone Helps Preserve Kidney Function\n\nTo test this idea, the research team organized a multicenter Phase II clinical study (LUBI-CKD TRIAL) across nine medical facilities in Japan. The trial enrolled 150 individuals with moderate CKD and examined how lubiprostone affected kidney health. When compared with participants who received a placebo, those given 8 µg or 16 µg of lubiprostone experienced a slower decline in kidney function. This finding was based on changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a standard measure used to evaluate kidney performance.\n\nThe scientists also explored why the drug had this protective effect. They determined that lubiprostone boosts the production of spermidine, a compound that enhances mitochondrial activity by encouraging the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Improved mitochondrial function was linked to a renoprotective effect that helped limit additional kidney damage.\n\nNext Steps and Potential for Personalized CKD Treatment\n\nThe team plans to expand their investigation through a Phase 3 clinical trial involving a larger group of participants. They also aim to identify biomarkers that could help predict which patients are most likely to benefit. Their long-term objective is to tailor treatment strategies to each person with CKD. This approach represents a significant shift from current CKD therapies, which focus mainly on lowering uremic toxins.\n\nOverall, the findings indicate that certain laxatives may help slow the progression of kidney deterioration. This concept could also open doors to new treatments for conditions involving mitochondrial dysfunction. Details of the study were published in the scientific journal Science Advances.",

      "summary": "By blocking a molecule that pushes the immune system into overdrive, a vaccine protects mice from life-threatening anaphylaxis",
      "content": "By blocking a molecule that pushes the immune system into overdrive, a vaccine protects mice from life-threatening anaphylaxis\n\nA vaccine in development could offer an alternative way to combat severe food allergies Tartezy / Alamy\n\nMice can be protected from the life-threatening allergic reaction anaphylaxis for at least a year using an experimental vaccine. The hope is that it will work in humans too.\n\nThe threat of anaphylaxis constantly hangs over hundreds of millions of people globally, with allergies to foods like peanuts or shellfish one common risk factor. In the UK, for example, around 6 per cent of adults – or 2.4 million people – are estimated to have a clinically confirmed food allergy.\n\nEating contaminated food, or even kissing someone who has recently eaten a food that makes you react, can cause a spike in molecules produced by the immune system called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, leading to swelling of the tongue or throat, difficulty breathing and a drop in blood pressure. This can result in a hospital visit – even if you have an adrenaline auto-injector like an EpiPen on hand to reverse the symptoms. In severe cases, anaphylaxis can be fatal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from attempting to avoid the allergen, options to prevent such attacks are limited. You can try oral immunotherapy, which involves consuming small, gradually increasing amounts of an allergenic food under supervision to build tolerance, or take a drug called an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, such as omalizumab, which binds to IgE, stopping it from causing a reaction. But omalizumab is expensive and needs to be injected every few weeks, potentially for life.\n\nNow, Laurent Reber at the Toulouse Institute for Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases, France, and his colleagues have developed a vaccine named IgE-K. This primes the immune system to produce antibodies that target IgE, preventing it from binding to its receptors on immune cells, and halting a subsequent runaway allergic reaction.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Health Check Expert insight and news on scientific developments in health, nutrition and fitness, every Saturday. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“We wanted to come up with a solution that could be long-term, because when you are food allergic, you can be exposed anytime by accident, so you really want to be protected all the time,” says Reber.\n\nIn tests on mice modified to produce a human version of IgE, the researchers found that two doses of the vaccine induced the mice to generate neutralising antibodies against IgE.\n\n“It blocks up the molecule that makes us allergic,” says Josh Koenig at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe researchers then gave the mice a substance that would cause an allergic reaction. Unvaccinated mice had a strong reaction, but vaccinated ones were protected against anaphylaxis for as long as a year without showing any adverse effects.\n\n“It could be longer, but we haven’t tested longer,” says Reber.\n\nIgE is part of the body’s immune system, and as well as generating allergic reactions, it fires up in response to venoms and some intestinal parasites. “It’s probably an ancestral system that helps fight against toxins,” says Reber.\n\nReber says many people at risk of serious allergic reactions have received anti-IgE therapies for years without discontinuation and experienced no ill-effects, so there is good evidence that it is safe to target the molecule long-term. But to see whether dampening down IgE could reduce the body’s effectiveness at fighting parasites, the researchers did an additional experiment in mice. They found that the vaccine didn’t impair the immune response to an infection by Strongyloides ratti, a parasitic nematode worm.\n\nKoenig is optimistic that such a vaccine would be effective in people. “They know that the mouse made the antibody that bound up the human IgE molecule properly. If humans make that same molecule, then I think there’s a pretty high chance that this will work out quite nicely.”\n\nStill, clinical trials are needed to evaluate the vaccine’s safety, efficacy and duration in humans, says Reber. If it does come to market, he thinks it could be a cost-effective way to treat people with severe allergies because it would require far fewer injections than an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody like omalizumab.",

      "summary": "Sweat carries a rich mix of biomarkers that advanced wearables can now track in real time. New AI-powered patches analyze biochemical patterns to detect disease risks, medication levels, or stress responses. Researchers are building ultra-sensitive microfluidic devices to read glucose, cortisol, and more—without needles or blood draws. The tech is still emerging, but its potential is huge.",
      "content": "Sweat carries a wide range of biological signals, and a growing body of research suggests that pairing it with artificial intelligence and advanced sensor technology could reshape how we track our health and daily physiology. According to a recent study, this combination may provide a powerful new approach for monitoring personal well-being.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis, the study explores how sweat could be used for real-time assessment of hormones, medication levels, and other biomarkers, as well as for early identification of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.\n\n\"Collecting sweat is painless, simple and non-invasive,\" said co-author Dr. Dayanne Bordin, an analytical chemist at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). \"It's an attractive alternative to blood or urine, especially for continuous monitoring in real-time.\"\n\nGrowing Interest in Wearables That Analyze Sweat\n\n\"Anyone who is already interested in tracking their health using wearables such as an Apple watch -- for example their heart rate, step count or blood pressure -- would be interested in the information sweat can provide.\n\n\"There are already sweat monitoring devices on the market such as the Gatorade sweat patch, which is a single-use, wearable sticker that pairs with an app to analyse your sweat rate and sodium loss, and provide tailored advice.\"\n\nRecent progress in areas like microfluidics, stretchable electronics and wireless communication has made it possible to build a new class of wearable sensors. These lightweight, flexible patches rest directly on the skin and continuously collect sweat samples.\n\nWhen these devices are combined with artificial intelligence, they may be able to identify specific metabolites and interpret complex chemical patterns, which could give users more personalized health information and earlier warning of various medical conditions.\n\nPotential Uses for Athletes and Patients\n\nAthletes could use them to track electrolyte loss during workouts and to demonstrate that they are drug free before competitions. People managing diabetes may eventually rely on sweat based glucose detection rather than blood tests.\n\n\"Sweat is an under-used diagnostic fluid,\" said co-author Dr. Janice McCauley from the UTS Faculty of Science.\n\n\"The ability to measure multiple biomarkers simultaneously, and transmit that data wirelessly, provides enormous potential for preventive health care.\n\n\"The year 2023 was marked by an evolutionary step in artificial intelligence, opening the door for improved pattern analysis and classification algorithms to improve diagnostic precision and therapeutic accuracy,\" she said.\n\nAdvances in AI and Ultra Sensitive Devices\n\nModern AI systems can now analyze very large datasets to connect subtle chemical signals in sweat with particular physiological conditions. The authors note that the next major milestone will involve pairing this analytical capability with compact, low power devices that can send data securely.\n\nUTS researchers are currently investigating the basic physiological characteristics of sweat. They are also creating microfluidic tools that can detect extremely small concentrations of biomarkers such as glucose and cortisol.\n\nAlthough much of this work is still in the prototype phase, interest from industry continues to increase.\n\n\"We're not far from a future where your wearable can tell you when you've got high stress hormone levels, and by monitoring this over time, whether you are at risk of chronic health conditions,\" Dr. Bordin said.",
