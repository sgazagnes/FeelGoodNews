Their jointly issued publication, Roadmap for Change: The Path Toward Implementing the Legal Capacity Reform in Mexico City, is a practical guide to carrying out the reform.The reform, which took effect in December 2024, recognizes that all adults have full legal capacity—the right to make decisions about their own lives—regardless of disability, age, or health status. It prohibits any restriction of this right based on placing the person under any protected status, to ensure that anyone may choose to receive support in exercising their rights if they wish, but can never be forced to do so.Roberto Garzón, president of the College of Notaries of Mexico City, emphasized the importance of notaries’ leadership in making this reform a reality:“The notary profession plays a vital role in making the principles of autonomy, equality, and dignity a lived reality for everyone,” Garzón said. “Through our daily practice, we can help ensure that no one is excluded from exercising their rights simply because they communicate, think, or make decisions differently.”“This reform marks a historic step for human rights in Mexico City,” said Carlos Ríos Espinosa, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “It moves the city away from outdated systems that deprived people of control over their lives and toward a model that recognizes everyone’s right to make their own choices, with support when needed.”The guide was developed jointly by Human Rights Watch and the College of Notaries of Mexico City, to provide clear explanations and case studies illustrating how the reform can be applied in everyday practice. It includes examples of good practices for communicating effectively with people who may need support to make decisions, along with practical templates for designating people to provide that support.The cases in the roadmap are hypothetical, but are based on real and recurring situations that notaries encounter across Mexico City. They reflect common consultations, concerns, and legal acts typically handled in notary offices, illustrating how the new legal framework can be used to respect the will and preferences of each individual.The examples include:A man with West syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy, who designates types of support to help him accept an inheritance from his mother and make informed decisions about investing the proceeds. The case demonstrates how notaries can facilitate accessible communication and ensure that the person’s will and preferences guide every step of the process.A 70-year-old woman, who makes an advance designation of types of support to ensure that, in the future, she can receive assistance in making decisions about managing her assets, planning investments, and her daily life. This example highlights how advance designation can safeguard autonomy while allowing people to plan for possible changing circumstances such as illness or disability.A young woman on the autism spectrum who designates types of support to help her carry out administrative procedures with public institutions. The case shows how the law enables people to choose the type of assistance they need to navigate bureaucratic systems without relinquishing their right to make their own decisions.The roadmap emphasizes that the right to legal capacity is guaranteed under international human rights law, including Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which Mexico ratified in 2007. It offers concrete recommendations to ensure that notaries and public institutions respect the will and preferences of individuals while establishing safeguards to prevent abuse or conflicts of interest.“This reform has the potential to transform lives,” Ríos Espinosa said. “But laws alone are not enough. Implementation will require training, awareness, and a change in attitudes to ensure that people with disabilities and older people can make decisions about their own lives—where to live, how to manage their finances, what medical treatments to accept—just like everyone else.”Human Rights Watch and the College of Notaries urged Mexico City authorities to ensure that notaries, judges, and social service providers receive continuing training on the new legal framework. They also emphasized the need for clear regulatory guidelines and accessible materials to support effective implementation, and urged other state governments to adopt and replicate this model in their own jurisdictions.The Mexico City reform and the Roadmap for Change mark a decisive step away from substituted decision-making, such as guardianship, toward genuine support for exercising legal capacity. Together, Human Rights Watch and the College of Notaries reaffirm their shared commitment to promoting a legal culture that places autonomy and equality at the heart of justice.“This represents not only a legal change, but a profound cultural shift,” Garzon said. “It reaffirms that all people, including those historically marginalized, have the right to make decisions about their own lives. The College of Notaries of Mexico City is proud to contribute to support this transformation by promoting professional practices that respect the will and preferences of every individual.”",

Laws sometimes gave others control over their choices, which affected their independence.\n\n**What happened** – In December 2024, Mexico City changed its Civil Code to give all adults full legal capacity. This means everyone, regardless of disability or age, has the right to make decisions about their own lives. Human Rights Watch and the College of Notaries of Mexico City created a 70-page guide, called the Roadmap for Change, to help notaries, judges, and institutions apply this new law in real life. The guide includes examples of how people can get support if they want it, without losing control over their decisions.\n\n**Impact** – This reform is important because it moves away from old rules that took decision power away from people with disabilities or older adults. Now, they can choose how to get help making decisions, if they want it, while keeping their independence. For example, a man with epilepsy can decide how to handle an inheritance with support, and a woman on the autism spectrum can get help with official paperwork but still make her own choices. This law respects each person’s will and preferences.\n\n**What's next step** – Authorities in Mexico City plan to train notaries, judges, and social workers on how to use the new law properly. They also want other states in Mexico to adopt similar reforms. Clear rules and easy-to-understand materials will be created to make sure everyone benefits from this change.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Mexico City’s new law ensures that all adults, including those with disabilities and older people, can make their own legal decisions with respect and support when needed.\n",

Les lois donnaient parfois à d’autres le contrôle de leurs choix, ce qui affectait leur autonomie.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – En décembre 2024, Mexico a modifié son Code civil pour reconnaître à tous les adultes la pleine capacité juridique. Cela signifie que chacun, quel que soit son handicap ou son âge, a le droit de décider de sa vie. Human Rights Watch et le Collège des notaires de Mexico ont créé un guide de 70 pages, intitulé Feuille de route pour le changement, pour aider les notaires, juges et institutions à appliquer cette nouvelle loi. Ce guide contient des exemples montrant comment obtenir un soutien sans perdre le contrôle de ses décisions.\n\n**Impact** – Cette réforme est importante car elle abandonne les anciennes règles qui privaient les personnes handicapées ou âgées de leur pouvoir de décision. Désormais, elles peuvent choisir d’être aidées si elles le souhaitent, tout en gardant leur indépendance. Par exemple, un homme atteint d’épilepsie peut décider comment gérer un héritage avec un soutien, et une femme autiste peut recevoir de l’aide pour les démarches administratives tout en gardant ses choix personnels. La loi respecte la volonté et les préférences de chacun.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les autorités de Mexico prévoient de former notaires, juges et travailleurs sociaux à la bonne application de la loi. Elles souhaitent aussi que d’autres états du Mexique adoptent des réformes similaires. Des règles claires et des documents faciles à comprendre seront créés pour que tout le monde profite de ce changement.\n\n**Phrase clé** – La nouvelle loi de Mexico garantit que tous les adultes, y compris les personnes en situation de handicap et les personnes âgées, peuvent prendre leurs propres décisions juridiques avec respect et soutien si nécessaire.\n",

Ahora, pueden elegir cómo recibir ayuda para tomar decisiones manteniendo su independencia. Por ejemplo, un hombre con epilepsia puede decidir cómo manejar una herencia con apoyo, y una mujer con autismo puede recibir ayuda para trámites oficiales pero mantener sus propias elecciones.

Hilda brings insight, compassion, and determination to her work, and her advocacy is a beacon of hope for people with disabilities facing discrimination and stigma across the region.”Over the past several years, Macheso has contributed significantly to disability advocacy efforts in Malawi, including leading awareness campaigns, coordinating International Albinism Awareness Day events, and supporting youth-focused policy engagement through the EU Malawi Youth Sounding Board. She has also influenced disability rights policy at the regional level through her work with the 3rd SADC Youth Parliament, where she wrote and presented a regional report on youth with disabilities that informed parliamentary resolutions across Southern Africa.Macheso brings a creative approach to rights-based community engagement. While at the University of Malawi’s Disability Rights Clinic, she helped replace traditional presentations with interactive theater activities that encouraged dialogue and reflection. By using storytelling, role playing, and performance, she has created safe spaces for communities to talk openly about disability, confront harmful stereotypes, and promote more inclusive attitudes.She has also been a crucial partner to the Human Rights Watch ongoing research in Malawi documenting employment discrimination and economic disenfranchisement of people with albinism. As a translator and research assistant, she helped conduct interviews, facilitated coordination with local communities, and ensured respectful, accurate engagement with people with albinism who had experienced discrimination.“I want people with albinism to be seen, valued, and included,” Macheso said. “We have rights, we have dreams, and we deserve real opportunities to learn, to work, and to live with dignity. This fellowship is a chance for me to grow as an advocate and bring stronger visibility and justice to my community.”Macheso’s activism comes at a time when the rights of people with albinism face ongoing challenges in parts of Africa. People with albinism experience violence linked to harmful myths and superstitions, as well as entrenched discrimination in education, access to health care, and employment. These systemic barriers often leave people with albinism facing social and economic marginalization, struggling to stay in school, secure decent work, and participate fully in community life.Macheso was selected from a competitive pool of candidates nominated by Human Rights Watch staff for their disability rights leadership. As part of her fellowship, Macheso will receive training in research, advocacy, communications, and fundraising from Human Rights Watch colleagues. The fellowship further provides opportunities to strengthen her networks with other organizations and advocates.Human Rights Watch established the fellowship to honor the disability rights icon Marca Bristo, founder of Access Living and inaugural chair of the Human Rights Watch disability rights advisory committee. Bristo was a key advocate for the adoption of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and helped shape the Human Rights Watch disability rights strategy.

      "content": "Coinciding with the anniversary of the collapse of the former regime, “things are improving,” Mohammad Al Nsour, Chief of the Middle East and North Africa Section at OHCHR told UN News.\n\n“Every time we go to Damascus, we can see the change.”\n\nOHCHR – blocked from operating inside Syria for many years – now has a team permanently deployed in Damascus. For Mr. Al Nsour, this marks a significant turning point after a long period of monitoring human rights conditions remotely from Beirut.\n\n“The former government denied access to OHCHR,” he recalled, speaking from Geneva. “We tried many times,” but now, “it is a great advantage to be on the ground”, he added.\n\n© Wikimedia Commons/Bernard Gagnon Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria.\n\nSigns of progress\n\nSyria continues to face a number of pressing priorities: the need to rebuild a war-damaged country, addressing the many remaining grievances, and achieving justice for past and present violations.\n\nThe senior official noted that insecurity also remains an alarming concern – from the northeast, to Sweida – to the mass killings earlier this year in coastal areas, including by members of the government’s security forces.\n\nYet, he insisted that the overall direction is “very constructive and positive.”\n\n“There is a political will from the government to improve,” he said, emphasising daily engagement between OHCHR and the authorities. The government has been receiving technical assistance from UN officials aimed at reforming legislation, strengthening human rights in law enforcement institutions, and improving public administration.\n\nThese steps, he said, show a commitment to a rights-based future.\n\nHe stressed that one of the major advantages of having an office inside the country is that is functions “as an advisor to the authorities.”\n\n“We monitor, report, and use advocacy to alert the authorities of violations in order to prevent them. Our purpose and main objective is not to shame and blame any government, rather to prevent violations.”\n\nSoundcloud\n\nSymbolic change\n\nPreparations are under way for Syria’s first ever Human Rights Day celebration on 10 December, only two days after it marks a year since the fall of the Assad regime.\n\nThe event is co-organized by OHCHR and the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the theme: A human rights approach to reconstruction.\n\nMr. Al Nsour said the celebration will mark “a new chapter in our relationship with the Syrian government” and discussions will focus on “how to advance the human rights agenda in the new Syria.”\n\nAccountability and justice\n\nFor many Syrians, accountability remains central.\n\nAfter violent incidents in the coastal region last March, the authorities established a National Investigative Committee – which received significant technical advice from OHCHR – and now, some perpetrators are being tried before a national court.\n\nMr. Al Nsour noted that the Government also accepted the renewal of the UN Commission of Inquiry’s mandate, enabling continued independent international investigations, not only in the violations committed under the Assad regime, but also since its fall.\n\nLooking ahead, transitional justice is the priority for 2026.\n\n“There is a need not only for accountability,” he said, “but also truth-telling, reparations, and national reconciliation.”\n\nWomen’s voices\n\nOHCHR is also supporting women-led civil society organisations and promoting greater women’s representation in political institutions, particularly in the wake of parliamentary elections – a request Mr. Al Nsour said the authorities are becoming increasingly receptive to.\n\nAt the same time, it is also empowering these organisations by training them to use advocacy to promote their cause and connecting them with international human rights mechanisms.\n\n© UNOCHA/Ali Haj Suleiman OCHA cross-border mission to Ma'arrat An Nu'man.\n\nThe OHCHR official emphasised that the greatest source of hope for Syria is Syrians themselves.\n\n“What is amazing about Syria is the resilience of the Syrian people,” he said. “What gives you hope is this amazing, educated young generation that is willing to engage with the new Syria in a very positive way.”\n\nAcross the country, he noted that young people have launched grassroots initiatives, from cleaning public parks to supporting local services – small acts that rebuild a sense of community after conflict.\n\n“They saw what happened in other countries – post conflict situations in the region and beyond – and they are trying their best to push in the right direction.”\n\nA long road ahead\n\nFinancial pressures are mounting, but donors have shown “very positive indications” of increased funding for Syria, according to Mr. Al Nsour.\n\n“There is great interest from major donors to promote human rights in the new Syria”, he explained, both from within and outside the region.\n\nDespite many hurdles, he noted the determination of Syrians to rebuild their country, grounded in human rights.\n\nAs Syrians mark Human Rights Day this year, perhaps the greatest message is clear: progress, however fragile, is finally visible – and hope is rising with it.",

For many years, UN human rights officials could not work inside the country and had to monitor the situation from outside.\n\n**What happened** – For the first time, Syrians will publicly mark Human Rights Day on December 10. The UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) now has a permanent team in Damascus. The Syrian government is working with the UN to improve laws, human rights in police forces, and public services.

Syrians, especially young people, are leading community efforts to rebuild and improve their country. This cooperation is helping Syria take small but important steps toward justice and respect for rights.\n\n**What's next step** – Syria will focus on transitional justice in 2026, which means not only punishing wrongdoers but also telling the truth about past abuses and helping communities heal.

      "content": "“When inclusion is real, everyone benefits,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in his message to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.\n\nHe stressed that people with disabilities drive progress that benefits everyone, highlighting how their leadership has improved disaster preparedness, expanded inclusive education and employment, and ensured that humanitarian responses reach those most at risk.\n\nTweet URL\n\n‘Structural failures’ persist\n\nThe head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), Li Jinhua, recalled that at the Second World Summit for Social Development held last month in Doha, the international community reaffirmed that real social progress is only achieved when everyone is included.\n\nYet persons with disabilities continue to face obstacles to integration, including higher multi-dimensional poverty. They are also twice as likely to be unemployed, in addition to being excluded from a world moving increasingly online.\n\n“These are not just statistics. They are structural failures that undermine our collective potential,” he said in a recorded message at a virtual event to commemorate the Day.\n\nDeaf youth lead at the UN\n\nParticipants included representatives from Deaf Leaders of Tomorrow Foundation (DLTF), an international non-profit that is spearheading a youth-led pilot initiative on sign language rights at the UN.\n\nIt involves training at DTLF, Gallaudet University – the world’s first such institution for deaf and hard of hearing students – and at UN Headquarters in New York, so that deaf youth gain a foundation in human rights frameworks, disability rights principles, diplomacy and global advocacy.\n\nThe initiative does more than just train young leaders, but also “strengthens global development, departing from the disability framework to the human rights framework,” DLTF’s Yana Hadjihristova said in sign language.\n\nShe urged Member States and UN agencies to integrate sign language rights into all youth frameworks, adopt a global sign language equity strategy, and ensure that deaf youth play a bigger role in decision-making.\n\n“The message we bring is simple and powerful,” she said. “Sign language creates leaders. Deaf leaders create inclusion. And when the United Nations promotes sign language equity, the entire human rights system becomes stronger.”\n\nFrom commitment to action\n\nIn Doha, countries adopted a declaration that outlined “a clear blueprint” towards full inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities, said Mr. Li.\n\nActions include social policies and programmes on integration, addressing needs as well as ensuring inclusive, accessible and equitable health services, housing, education, universal social protection and employment opportunities.\n\nHe said UNDESA is fully committed to supporting Member States in turning the commitments into national policy.\n\n“As we move forward, let us remember societies that work for persons with disabilities are resilient, equitable and prosperous for all, leaving no one behind.”\n\nAdvocacy over inspiration\n\nIn New York, the outgoing UN Global Advocate for Persons with Disabilities in Conflict and Peacebuilding Situations said he felt that he had failed in the position, noting that the situation for this population has not changed.\n\nPhotojournalist Gilles Duley, who lost three limbs in Afghanistan, said that his job as an advocate is to bring stories from the frontline. Yet, as a person with a disability, he is often asked to deliver inspiring talks.\n\n“I'm not here as an advocate to be an inspiration for people. My job is to share stories, because the reality on the ground for people with disability has not changed,” he said.\n\n“So, I feel I failed in my position here. I feel it has achieved very little because I have not had that opportunity to truly be an advocate.”\n\nMr. Duley said that too often, persons with disabilities are presented as inspirational and resilient, which they are, “but that means the stories of those left behind who are truly vulnerable are often ignored or forgotten. We can't romanticize the idea of disability.”",
