      "title": "This Ghanaian barrister is building bridges between law, feminism, and social change",
      "summary": "\"I can be a lawyer with a gendered lens, a development expert with a gendered lens, a political scientist with a gendered lens, and a professor with a gendered lens.\"",
      "content": "“My name is Jarpa Dawuni, and I often shorten it as J. Jarpa because my first name is actually Josephine,” she explains. “But in an attempt to decolonize in every aspect, I hyphenated it — Josephine-Jarpa — and I use Jarpa, which is my ‘native’ or local name from Ghana.”\n\nFrom the start, Dr. Jarpa Dawuni makes clear that identity for her is an act of agency. She resists being reduced to a single role. Smiling at the impossibility of being contained she says:\n\nI would describe myself as a feminist, a womanist, a mother, an aunt, a social activist, a professor, a lawyer, and the list goes on.\n\nThat layered self-description is not a rhetorical flourish; it is the lived reality of a Ghanaian barrister turned political scientist, institution-builder at Howard University, and founder of the Institute for African Women in Law (IAWL). Across each role runs a consistent thread: the conviction that women’s voices belong at the center of law, leadership, and social transformation.\n\nThe matriarch’s legacy\n\nDawuni traces her first lessons in resistance and self-knowledge to her grandmother, the matriarch of her family. She recalls: “She had a strong sense of knowing who she was, knowing what was good for her, what she would stand up for, what she would not stand up for.” Though her grandmother had no formal education, she commanded authority and transmitted values of dignity and excellence to her children and grandchildren.\n\nThis legacy shaped how Dawuni understood activism: not as the work of elites, but as something embedded in family life and “part of the DNA.” She describes watching her grandmother’s spirit echoed in her mother, her aunties, and now in her own role as a mother and auntie.\n\nEverybody has the power to be an activist — whether it flourishes often depends on the environment.\n\nFrom law to scholarship\n\nHer professional journey mirrors that conviction. Dawuni is a qualified barrister-at-law before the Ghana Superior Courts and holds a PhD in political science from Georgia State University. She went on to join Howard University, where she is now a Full Professor of Political Science. Her research spans judicial politics, women in the legal professions, gender and law, democratization, and international human rights.\n\nWhat unites this range is her insistence on a gendered lens. She explains:\n\nI can be a lawyer with a gendered lens, a development expert with a gendered lens, a political scientist with a gendered lens, and a professor with a gendered lens.\n\nThat orientation led her to notice a glaring silence in the literature: the absence of sustained work on African women in law.\n\nI started looking into research on African women in law, and I really couldn’t find much. So I began to write.\n\nThe result has been a prolific and field-shaping body of work. She has also conducted fieldwork in more than ten African countries, as well as the United Kingdom and Brazil, documenting stories that otherwise would have remained invisible. She reflects:\n\nI remembered Toni Morrison’s line: if there’s a book you want to read and it hasn’t been written, then you must write it. That’s what I did.\n\nA social entrepreneur in academia\n\nFor Dawuni, research is only one side of her activism. “I call myself a social entrepreneur. I create stuff, I fill in gaps where there’s a gap.”\n\nOne of her proudest examples is at Howard University. When she arrived in 2015, she discovered there was no program devoted to women and gender studies. She began by organizing small initiatives — an International Women’s Day program here, a faculty collective there — but funding was scarce. Then one day the university president called: “Send me a proposal by 10 a.m. tomorrow.”\n\nShe laughs at the memory. “Less than 24 hours! But because I’d been percolating ideas for years, I sat down, didn’t sleep, and wrote the proposal.”\n\nShe initially asked for USD 30,000. The president suggested USD 250,000. By the time the negotiations concluded, she had secured USD 1 million — during the early months of the pandemic, no less. With that support, she founded the Center for Women, Gender, and Global Leadership, the first of its kind at Howard.\n\nHer ability to translate vision into resources is part of a wider record: she has raised millions in grants and fellowships, including as Principal Investigator of a major National Science Foundation study on Black and Afro-descendant women judges. She has also been recognized internationally, receiving the Women in Law Academia International Award in Austria and the White House Presidential Award for her service on the board of the African Research Academies for Women.\n\nHer lesson is clear:\n\nBe prepared, so when the opportunity comes, you’re ready to hit gold. And don’t let people down when they call on you.\n\nAfrican feminism, womanism, and contextual equality\n\nWhen asked to define her feminism, Dawuni is pragmatic but precise.\n\nFor me, feminism is simply the idea of equality of the sexes. But my reality as an African woman is different from my African-American sister who was born and raised as a Black woman in Louisiana. There may be commonalities, but there are also differences.\n\nShe often uses feminism and womanism interchangeably.\n\nIf the word feminism will not necessarily fly with some people, I have to be respectful of that. Womanism is rooted in African systems of womanhood and the communal nature of our lived experiences.\n\nThis fluidity is strategic: she builds bridges across communities, while refusing the universalizing assumptions of Western feminism.\n\nHer work links African feminist thought to broader struggles of “third world feminists” — from Chicana to Asian to African thinkers — resisting racialized and colonial hierarchies in the feminist canon. Through her research, she has developed matri-legal feminism, a theoretical approach that centers the African matriarchal experience in the legal feminist discourse.\n\nResearch, resilience, and grassroots impact\n\nDawuni is candid about her doubts. “Sometimes I sit down and think, oh, my research and my activism are so elitist because I’m dealing with judges, lawyers, academics.” But she insists that elites, too, are subject to patriarchy — and shaping their consciousness can have ripple effects. “The multiplicative effect matters,” she explains.\n\nIf we are able to support women in law, and these women are gender-focused and minded, they will support other women. If judges are trained to recognize gendered dimensions of the law, if lawyers understand that what they thought was just ‘colleague play’ is actually harassment, then their clients and communities feel the impact.\n\nBehind these professional achievements lies a story of perseverance through difficulty. Balancing motherhood, teaching, and research, Dawuni also endured profound personal losses during her doctoral studies. Rather than halting her trajectory, she channeled those experiences into her scholarship and activism. She recalls: “Through it all, I still finished my PhD. Everything I do, I remember my sister, I remember my mother. I’m doing it in their honor and just to keep pushing on in life.”\n\nHer resilience underscores a lesson she shares often with younger scholars: success is rarely linear.\n\nPeople admire the blossoms but forget the roots. Success is like that. The roots are in the hard, painful, unseen work.\n\nAdvice for the next generation\n\nFor those just starting out, Dawuni emphasizes the importance of self-inspiration and preparation. She recounts how small encounters with women role models shaped her sense of what was possible.\n\nIn 1994, she read an Ebony magazine profile of Dr. Nanette Graham, a young professor and lawyer. Inspired, she cut out Graham’s picture and still keeps it almost thirty years later. A year later, she met Ghanaian lawyer Adeline Araba Ainooson. Dawuni admired her elegance and asked for a picture of her call to the bar. Araba sent one, writing on the back, “I hope it inspires you.” It did — and the two are still close friends today.\n\nThese early encounters became her compass.\n\nInitially, I appeared to be lost — friends and family asked, ‘What do you really want to do — law, development work, or politics?’ But a common thread that ran through all my degrees was my passion for women’s and children’s rights. I decided to weave a mosaic from my interdisciplinary training in law, development, and politics. I chose academia — a profession that has allowed me to engage in research and to use my scholarship to promote activism for gender equity in law and access to justice.\n\nAs she explains, storytelling itself is a form of activism. “My goal is to move from the oral tradition of storytelling to the written tradition of documentation — to historicize women in law.”\n\nHer advice to younger generations is straightforward:",

Catherine, who sent the message to mark Addiction Awareness Week, said \"significant progress\" has been made to better understand addiction, but warned more needs to be done. The princess is the patron of The Forward Trust, a charity that tries to break the cycle of addiction and is behind the campaign running from 23-30 November. Catherine, who has also campaigned on mental health issues, draws parallels between the two conditions in her message.\n\nShe said addiction was \"not a choice or a personal failing, but a complex mental health condition that should be met with empathy and support. She added: \"But still, even now in 2025, people's experience of addiction is shaped by fear, shame and judgement. This needs to change. \"The stigma surrounding those who face addiction allows it to thrive behind closed doors, impacting families and communities, and ultimately ruining lives.\" The princess said that many people will know someone who is struggling with addiction. \"Now is the moment to show our compassion and love to help them, or their friends and family, to reach out to organisations like The Forward Trust for support,\" she said. \"Recovery is hard, but with the right treatment it is possible. And this begins with a conversation, a listening ear and showing we care.\" Catherine launched the first Addiction Awareness Week in 2021 on behalf of the trust and its Taking Action on Addiction campaign.

She noted that the Growth Plan has brought a new dynamic to the integrations and added that the Western Balkans is already part of Europe, and it remains to be institutionally confirmed. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama stated in his opening address that the Western Balkans is important as it has decided to move forward together, with the Growth Plan as a common roadmap, but, as he says, not only towards Brussels, but towards the freedoms and opportunities of a unique European market.\n\nRama assessed that the Western Balkans has never experienced reforms of this level of transformation and stated that the region strives to grow with Europe, not at its expense, proving daily that it belongs to the EU.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In late 2022, a deadly fire in a city in China called Urumqi happened during strict Covid-19 lockdowns. Many people blamed the harsh rules for making it hard to escape the fire. This led to big protests across several Chinese cities.\n\n**What happened** – Thousands of people, mostly young, protested against the government’s strict Covid policy and called for human rights. They held up blank white sheets of paper to show their anger without using words, which became a symbol known as the White Paper protests. These were the largest protests in China since 1989.\n\n**Impact** – The protests helped speed up the end of the government’s strict Covid rules. They also sparked political awareness among young people in China and in Chinese communities abroad. Some young activists have started groups to support Tibetan culture and speak up against unfair treatment. However, the government arrested some protest leaders, showing the risks involved.\n\n**What's next step** – Despite arrests, the movement continues to grow quietly. Young activists are likely to keep pushing for rights and fairness. The protests have opened up new conversations about freedom and solidarity that could influence future changes in China and beyond.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The White Paper protests have inspired a new generation of young people in and outside China to stand up for human rights and challenge unfair policies.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Fin 2022, un incendie mortel dans la ville chinoise d’Urumqi a eu lieu pendant des confinements stricts liés au Covid-19. Beaucoup ont accusé ces règles sévères d’avoir empêché les gens de s’échapper de l’incendie. Cela a déclenché de grandes manifestations dans plusieurs villes chinoises.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des milliers de personnes, surtout des jeunes, ont protesté contre la politique stricte du Covid et ont demandé des droits humains. Ils tenaient des feuilles blanches vides pour montrer leur colère sans parler, ce qui est devenu un symbole appelé les manifestations du Papier blanc. Ce furent les plus grandes manifestations en Chine depuis 1989.\n\n**Impact** – Ces manifestations ont aidé à accélérer la fin des règles strictes contre le Covid. Elles ont aussi éveillé une conscience politique chez les jeunes en Chine et dans les communautés chinoises à l’étranger. Certains jeunes militants ont créé des groupes pour soutenir la culture tibétaine et dénoncer les traitements injustes. Mais le gouvernement a arrêté certains leaders, montrant les risques encourus.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Malgré les arrestations, le mouvement continue de grandir discrètement. Les jeunes militants devraient continuer à défendre les droits et la justice. Ces manifestations ont ouvert de nouvelles discussions sur la liberté et la solidarité qui pourraient influencer des changements futurs en Chine et ailleurs.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – Les manifestations du Papier blanc ont inspiré une nouvelle génération de jeunes, en Chine et à l’étranger, à défendre les droits humains et à contester les politiques injustes.\n",

Esto provocó grandes protestas en varias ciudades chinas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Miles de personas, principalmente jóvenes, protestaron contra la estricta política de Covid del gobierno y pidieron derechos humanos.

Fueron las protestas más grandes en China desde 1989.\n\n**Impacto** – Las protestas ayudaron a acelerar el fin de las estrictas reglas contra el Covid. También despertaron conciencia política entre los jóvenes en China y en las comunidades chinas en el extranjero.

Sin embargo, el gobierno arrestó a algunos líderes, mostrando los riesgos que enfrentan.\n\n**Próximo paso** – A pesar de los arrestos, el movimiento sigue creciendo en silencio. Es probable que los jóvenes activistas continúen luchando por los derechos y la justicia.
