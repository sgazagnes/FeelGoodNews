      "title": "First living cochlea outside the body shows how hearing really works",
      "summary": "Scientists have kept a tiny slice of cochlea alive outside the body, directly witnessing how hair cells amplify sound. The finding confirms a universal principle of hearing and could pave the way for long-sought treatments for hearing loss.",
      "content": "Shortly before his death in August 2025, A. James Hudspeth and his team in the Laboratory of Sensory Neuroscience at The Rockefeller University achieved a groundbreaking technological advancement: the ability to keep a tiny sliver of the cochlea alive and functional outside of the body for the first time. Their new device allowed them to capture the live biomechanics of the cochlea's remarkable auditory powers, including exceptional sensitivity, sharp frequency tuning, and the ability to encode a broad range of sound intensities.\n\n\"We can now observe the first steps of the hearing process in a controlled way that was previously impossible,\" says co-first author Francesco Gianoli, a postdoctoral fellow in the Hudspeth lab.\n\nDescribed in two recent papers (in PNAS and Hearing Research, respectively), the innovation is a product of Hudspeth's five decades of work illuminating the molecular and neural mechanisms of hearing -- insights that have illuminated new paths to preventing or reversing hearing loss.\n\nWith this advance, the researchers have also provided direct evidence of a unifying biophysical principle that governs hearing across the animal kingdom, a subject Hudspeth investigated for more than a quarter-century.\n\n\"This study is a masterpiece,\" says biophysicist Marcelo Magnasco, head of the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience at Rockefeller, who collaborated with Hudspeth on some of his seminal findings. \"In the field of biophysics, it's one of the most impressive experiments of the last five years.\"\n\nThe mechanics of hearing\n\nThough the cochlea is a marvel of evolutionary engineering, some of its fundamental mechanisms have long remained hidden. The organ's fragility and inaccessibility -- embedded as it is in the densest bone in the body -- have made it difficult to study in action.\n\nThese challenges have long frustrated hearing researchers, because most hearing loss results from damage to sensory receptors called hair cells that line the cochlea. The organ has some 16,000 of these hair cells, so-called because each one is topped by a few hundred fine \"feelers,\" or stereocilia, that early microscopists likened to hair. Each bundle is a tuned machine that amplifies and converts sound vibrations into electrical responses that the brain can then interpret.\n\nIt's well documented that in insects and non-vertebrate animals -- such as the bullfrogs studied in Hudspeth's lab -- a biophysical phenomenon known as a Hopf bifurcation is key to the hearing process. The Hopf bifurcation describes a kind of mechanical instability, a tipping point between complete stillness and oscillations. At this knife-edge, even the faintest sound tips the system into movement, allowing it to amplify weak signals far beyond what would otherwise register.\n\nIn the case of bullfrog cochlea, the instability is in the bundles of the sensory hair cells, which are always primed to detect incoming sound waves. When those waves hit, the hair cells move, amplifying the sound in what's called the active process.\n\nIn collaboration with Magnasco, Hudspeth documented the existence of the Hopf bifurcation in the bullfrog cochlea in 1998. Whether it exists in the mammalian cochlea has been a subject of debate in the field ever since.\n\nTo answer that question, Hudspeth's team decided they needed to observe the active process in a mammalian cochlea in real time and at a greater level of detail than ever before.\n\nA sliver of a spiral\n\nTo do so, the researchers turned to the cochlea of gerbils, whose hearing falls in a similar range as humans. They excised slivers no larger than .5 mm from the sensory organ, in the region of the cochlea that picks up the middle range of frequencies. They timed their excision to a developmental moment in which the gerbil's hearing is mature but the cochlea hasn't fully fused to the highly dense temporal bone.\n\nThey placed a sliver of tissue within a chamber designed to reproduce the living environment of the sensory tissue, including continuously bathing it in nutrient-rich liquids called endolymph and perilymph and maintaining its native temperature and voltage. Key to the development of this custom device were Brian Fabella, a research specialist in the Hudspeth lab, and instrumentation engineer Nicholas Belenko, from Rockefeller's Gruss Lipper Precision Instrumentation Technologies Resource Center.\n\nThey then began to play sounds via a tiny speaker and observed the response.\n\nDiscovering a biophysical principle\n\nAmong the processes they witnessed were how the opening and closing of ion channels in the hair bundles add energy to the sound-driven vibrations, amplifying them, and how outer hair cells elongate and contract in response to voltage changes through a process called electromotility.\n\n\"We could see in fine detail what every piece of the tissue is doing at the subcellular level,\" Gianoli says.\n\n\"This experiment required an extraordinarily high level of precision and delicacy,\" notes Magnasco. \"There's both mechanical fragility and electrochemical vulnerability at stake.\"\n\nImportantly, they observed that key to the active process was indeed a Hopf bifurcation -- the tipping point that turned mechanical instability into sound amplification. \"This shows that the mechanics of hearing in mammals is remarkably similar to what has been seen across the biosphere,\" says co-first author Rodrigo Alonso, a research associate in the lab.\n\nA device that could lead to future treatments\n\nThe scientists anticipate that experimentation using the ex vivo cochlea will improve their understanding of hearing and hopefully point to better therapies.\n\n\"For example, we will now be able to pharmacologically perturb the system in a very targeted way that has never been possible before, such as by focusing on specific cells or cell interactions,\" says Alonso.\n\nThere's a great need in the field for new potential therapies. \"So far, no drug has been approved to restore hearing in sensorineural loss, and one reason for that is that we still have an incomplete mechanistic understanding of the active process of hearing,\" Gianoli says. \"But now we have a tool that we can use to understand how the system works, and how and when it breaks -- and hopefully think of ways to intervene before it's too late.\"\n\nHudspeth found the results deeply gratifying, Magnasco adds. \"Jim had been working on this for more than 20 years, and it's a crowning achievement for a remarkable career.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The cochlea is a tiny, spiral-shaped organ in the ear that helps us hear by turning sound waves into signals for the brain. It is very delicate and hard to study because it is deep inside the skull. Scientists have long wanted to understand exactly how the cochlea’s tiny hair cells amplify sound, especially in mammals like humans.\n\n**What happened** – A team at Rockefeller University led by A. James Hudspeth managed to keep a tiny slice of a gerbil’s cochlea alive and working outside the body. They placed this small piece in a special chamber that mimics the cochlea’s natural environment. By playing sounds and watching how the hair cells moved, they could see the hearing process in action for the first time.\n\n**Impact** – This work confirmed a key idea called the Hopf bifurcation, a special mechanical state that helps hair cells amplify very faint sounds. Scientists had seen this in frogs before but were unsure if it worked the same way in mammals. Understanding this process in mammals is important because it could explain why hearing loss happens and how to fix it. This tool lets researchers test drugs and study hearing problems more closely than ever.\n\n**What’s next step** – The team plans to use this living cochlea slice to test medicines that might protect or repair hair cells. This could lead to new treatments for hearing loss, which currently has no approved drug cures.

I had to carry her on my back. I was terribly worried and thought I was going to lose her,” said Oriata, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nThat day, Noel-Dina was diagnosed with cholera.\n\n© UNICEF/Joseph Oriata (centre) participates in a community campaign against cholera.\n\nLike many children in their rural neighborhood of Grand-Goâve west of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, she lived without access to basic sanitation facilities. “We had no choice but to use the outdoors as our toilet. That's how the disease entered our lives,” Oriata explained.\n\nCholera spread\n\nCholera has recently been spreading in Haiti.

After seeing her daughter gradually regain strength, she became involved in awareness-raising activities in her community, going from house to house, to encourage other families to take action.\n\nHer commitment sparked a wave of solidarity.\n\n“When someone started digging a pit and couldn't continue, we would get together to help them and we did this house by house until it became a movement,” she recalled.\n\nThis mutual support transformed their neighbourhood. Latrines became the norm and hygiene practices such as systematic hand washing were adopted by everyone.\n\n“Today, when you walk through here, you no longer smell any bad odours because no one relieves themselves outside anymore,” she said.\n\nFull of dreams\n\nSitting on her bed, her maths notebooks open in front of her, Noel-Dina smiles shyly. She dreams of becoming a nurse. Every day, she helps her mother at home and washes her hands thoroughly after using the toilet, actions that have become automatic.\n\n“Before, I had to go outside. Now we have a latrine at home, and I'm glad my mum built it. She did it for me and for everyone,” she said.\n\nOther communities are also taking action with support from the UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF, and the local authorities.\n\nNearly 3,000 households now have access to safe and hygienic latrinesand 30 hygiene clubs, 22 in schools and 8 in health centres, have been created to encourage good practices among children, teachers, and medical staff.\n\n“Before, there were bacteria everywhere, and children often got sick. Now, even when a child has a fever, it's no longer because of dirt. They are healthier and happier,” said Oriata.",

      "title": "Scientists finally explain the real reason pregnant women get morning sickness",
      "summary": "Morning sickness isn’t just random misery—it’s a biological defense system shaped by evolution to protect the fetus. By linking immune responses to nausea and food aversions, UCLA researchers show these symptoms are signs of a healthy pregnancy.",
      "content": "Key takeaways\n\nA UCLA study has found that \"morning sickness\" symptoms, including nausea, vomiting and aversions to certain foods and smells, are linked to the body's natural, but complex, immune response during pregnancy.\n\nIn the early stages of pregnancy, a unique mix of inflammatory responses alongside behavioral mechanisms that researchers believe are adaptive, like nausea, achieves a delicate balance, allowing the mother to tolerate and nourish the half-foreign fetus while also avoiding potentially harmful foods.\n\nThe study could have workplace implications for pregnant women, helping to widen recognition that these symptoms are healthy and normal, both reducing stigma and paving the way for common-sense workplace accommodations.\n\nUCLA researchers have uncovered a link between \"morning sickness\" symptoms and the body's natural, but complex, inflammatory response to biological and bodily changes during pregnancy.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, up to 80% of early-stage pregnant mothers experience some nausea, vomiting and aversions to certain foods and smells. While uncomfortable, these symptoms are not typically a sign that anything is wrong with the health of the mother or the developing fetus, but rather an indication of a delicate balance unique to pregnant women.\n\n\"During pregnancy, a mother's immune system faces a tricky challenge: it has to protect both her and the fetus from infection, but without accidentally attacking the fetus, whose genetic identity is half-foreign because it is half derived from the father. Normally, the immune system attacks anything that seems foreign, so in pregnancy, it has to carefully adjust to keep the fetus safe while still defending against infection,\" said UCLA anthropology professor Molly Fox.\n\nFox is the corresponding author of the study \"Of scents and cytokines: How olfactory and food aversions relate to nausea and immunomodulation in early pregnancy,\" recently published in the journal Evolution, Medicine and Public Health.\n\nThe researchers believe that this delicate balance, which protects mother and fetus, is achieved by a unique mix of inflammatory responses. They function to prevent the mother's body from rejecting the fetus, alongside adaptive behavioral mechanisms, like nausea, that encourage the mother to avoid foods that are potentially harmful, especially in the first and second trimesters when the fetus is most vulnerable.\n\n\"Nausea, vomiting or aversions to foods or smells are not indications that something is going wrong for the mother or the fetus. It's likely an indication that everything is moving along normally, and a reflection of the body's healthy and helpful immune response,\" said UCLA anthropology professor and paper co-author Daniel Fessler.\n\nMethodology and findings\n\nFor the study, the UCLA-led team of anthropologists and epidemiologists collected and analyzed blood samples to measure immune system molecules called cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that send signals to help the body launch a quick defense against sickness and regulate inflammation. Participants also filled out questionnaires that asked about morning sickness-related symptoms and food and smell aversions during the early stages of pregnancy. The participants were 58 Latina women in Southern California who were followed beginning in early pregnancy through the postpartum.\n\nSixty-four percent of study participants experienced odor or food aversions, primarily to tobacco smoke and meat. Sixty-seven percent reported nausea and 66% experienced vomiting.\n\nThe study team measured cytokines that promote inflammation (pro-inflammatory) as well as cytokines that suppress inflammation (anti-inflammatory). They found that women who experienced an aversion to tobacco smoke showed a noticeable shift toward a more inflammatory response. Food aversions, nausea and vomiting were also associated with a more pro-inflammatory immune balance.\n\nNatural selection?\n\nThe correlation is consistent with researchers' theory that these symptoms may be part of an evolutionary adaptation that helps pregnant mothers' bodies minimize exposure to harmful substances, though the study's authors caution that the evidence is not definitive and more research is needed.\n\nThey emphasized that the study allowed the team to look at both human biological and behavioral responses during pregnancy.\n\n\"In many mammals, the fetal compartment has barriers separating it from the mother's blood supply, where her immune cells are. But in humans, we have a unique setup -- fetal cells are bathed in maternal blood. Humans have the most invasive of all placentas, burrowing deep into maternal tissue. So humans need unique strategies to prevent the mother's immune system from attacking the fetus,\" said Fox.\n\nThese immunological changes may induce nausea, which in turn encourages food avoidance that might act as an additional layer of protection, according to the researchers\n\n\"Nowadays, you will see labels on packages of ground beef or soft cheese that warn pregnant women to be cautious about these products because of the risks of foodborne illness during pregnancy. Aversions to certain odors and foods, and nausea and even vomiting, appear to be evolution's way of achieving that same objective,\" said Fessler.\n\nPractical implications\n\nThe researchers, including first author Dayoon Kwon, who just completed her Ph.D. in epidemiology at UCLA (and is now a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford), said that the study could help bolster recognition that nausea and vomiting are normal symptoms with biological underpinnings associated with healthy pregnancies. The study's results could help in paving the way for common-sense workplace accommodations, such as more efficient deployment of health care benefits and other helpful resources to reduce stigma, excessive absences and lost productivity.\n\nThey also encourage other researchers to continue to look into the questions raised by the study, to not only explore the evolutionary questions, but to work toward providing clinicians with non- or low-invasive measures of prognoses.\n\nFunding for this study was provided by the National Institute of Health.",

      "content": "Fermented foods make up a third of what we eat and were mostly discovered by accident centuries ago. Now a fermentation revolution is promising extraordinary new flavours and novel ways to boost gut health\n\nFermented foods and beverages make up a large proportion of the human diet and come in a wide variety of forms, from bread to kimchi Shutterstock; Stockfood\n\n“It’s blue cheese, but not as you’ve ever known it before,” says Paul Dyer, as we peer into a fridge full of very special cheeses that he helped create. When I try it, it blows my socks off – the best I have ever tasted.\n\nThe cheese is a Danish blue co-created by Myconeos, a company Dyer founded in Nottingham, UK. Myconeos doesn’t make the cheese, but it bred the fungus that gives it its unique taste. For centuries, blue-cheese-makers have relied on the same old strains of Penicillium roqueforti, which is why the classic blues all taste essentially the same. But not anymore. Thanks to a breakthrough that Dyer and his colleagues made a couple of years ago, cheese-makers suddenly have a range of new strains to play with. The first of the resulting new generation of cheeses is already on the market.\n\nThese cheeses are part of a wider revolution in food production dubbed fermentation 2.0. We rely on fermentation to produce about a third of our food intake, but the process has remained unchanged for millennia. Now, Dyer and other innovators are exploring a vast and largely uncharted “fermentation space” to create previously unknown foods and drinks with novel flavours and textures – not only dairy-based cheeses, but also new forms of miso, tempeh and kombucha, vegan cheeses that actually taste good and entirely new comestibles, some made from food waste. They are also exploring the possibility of using fermentation 2.0 to boost our health (see “Health boost?”).\n\n“People are realising there’s potential to make new combinations of microbes and substrates, and foods that haven’t been put together before… searching out new flavours and new opportunities to improve human health,” says Benjamin Wolfe at Tufts University in Massachusetts.\n\nFermentation is one of the most ancient forms of food processing, predating the agricultural revolution by several thousand years. It is simple in essence: take a raw substrate, add some microorganisms, and wait. The microbes digest the substrate and release all sorts of interesting flavours and textures, often transforming it into something new – think of the difference between raw milk and cheese.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Health Check Expert insight and news on scientific developments in health, nutrition and fitness, every Saturday. Sign up to newsletter\n\nBread, chocolate, kimchi, kombucha and more\n\nToday, fermented foods and beverages make up a large proportion of the human diet and come in a wide variety of forms – bread, cheese, yogurt, beer, wine, coffee, chocolate, miso, salami, kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, soy sauce, kombucha, fish sauce and hundreds more. Every cuisine includes ferments, and almost every conceivable class of food is fermented somewhere in the world.\n\nThe earliest ferments, which include a type of flatbread made by Natufian hunter-gatherers 14,000 years ago in what is now Jordan, were almost certainly “spontaneous” or “wild” fermentations, meaning that the fermenting was done by microorganisms already living on the raw food or in the environment. That is probably how all fermented foods were discovered, according to Wolfe. Ancient people noticed that when certain foods were accidentally left to spoil in particular ways, some developed interesting and delicious flavours, and they often lasted longer. “Fermented foods are largely happy accidents just using whatever food we had in the environment and whatever microbes happen to be around,” he says. These were then recreated and refined over many generations.\n\nA fireplace at the Shubayqa 1 archaeological site in north-eastern Jordan, where one of the earliest ferments – bread – was made 14,000 years ago Alexis Pantos\n\nAnd that is where things stood for centuries, until the late 19th century. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur had discovered that the souring of milk and production of alcohol from sugar – at that point thought to be purely chemical processes – were in fact caused by microorganisms, namely lactic acid bacteria and single-celled yeasts.\n\nFurther research identified four principal groups of fermentation organisms: yeasts for bread, wine and beer; lactic acid bacteria for yogurt, cheese, sausages, kimchi and sourdoughs; acetic acid bacteria for vinegar and kombucha; and moulds, or filamentous fungi, for fungal-ripened cheeses, salami, miso, soy sauce and many more.\n\nStarter cultures\n\nThese discoveries led to the invention of standardised starter cultures: off-the-shelf microbial concoctions designed to be added to substrates such as milk, grains and vegetables and ferment them to perfection. This took the chance element out of fermenting and allowed artisanal processes such as cheese-making and bread-baking to be industrialised. The majority of fermented foods we buy today are made this way.\n\nBut even with the invention of starter cultures, the range of fermented foods didn’t expand. That, however, is now changing, thanks to fermentation 2.0.\n\nThe seeds of this revolution were sown in the early 2000s, when new techniques such as metagenomics and metabolomics allowed food scientists to analyse exactly what is going on, microbially and molecularly, in fermented foods. “We’ve done this really neat work of mapping out those traditional ferments and figuring out what are the microbes and what are the metabolites that are in there,” says Wolfe. The health benefits of fermented foods have also started to be explored.\n\nMapping the world of fermented foods\n\nA decade ago, armed with this new understanding of the fermentation process, Michael Gänzle at the University of Alberta in Canada created a “periodic table” of fermented foods. Inspired by Dmitri Mendeleev’s periodic table of the elements, he drew up a chart with 118 cells and systematically placed examples of fermented foods into each one. Each column was dedicated to a certain type of ferment – wine, beer, bread, cheese, soy products, meat and more – with flavour intensity increasing from left to right and top to bottom.\n\nThe table started as a teaching aid, but it raised a question: just as the original periodic table revealed gaps that were later filled with newly discovered elements, could a table of ferments point to spaces that could eventually be occupied by new ferments?\n\nGänzle’s table was full, so Wolfe and his colleagues tried a different approach. They mapped all known ferments onto a multi-dimensional graph, which they called “fermentation space” (see graphic). Similar ferments are clustered together, with a bloc of meat and fish products on one side, a bloc of dairy on the other and a swathe of vegetable ferments in between them. “The closer they are to the other, that means they have very similar substrates and very similar microbes,” says Wolfe. But the graph wasn’t full – there are two yawning gaps that he says are waiting to be filled.\n\n“I think there’s potential for completely new ferments that haven’t been created through an accidental process,” says Wolfe. “Taking the base layer of traditional ferments and then building on that, tweaking that, moving things around, adding new microbes.”\n\nThe simplest route to a novel ferment is what is known as a crossover – transplanting the microbiome from a traditional fermented food onto a substrate it hasn’t been used on before. A few years ago, chef Lars Williams, who was then head of R&D at the world-famous restaurant Noma in Copenhagen, Denmark, started experimenting with novel misos. Traditional miso is made by growing the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae on steamed white rice, transferring the resulting mould – called kōji – onto salted soybeans and leaving the mixture to ferment, sometimes for years, creating a rich, umami paste with multiple culinary uses.\n\nNovel miso\n\nNoma’s philosophy is to use only local ingredients, so Williams grew the mould on pearl barley and then transferred the kōji to Nordic legumes, including Gotland lentils, lupin seeds and, most successfully, yellow peas. The resulting miso – which Noma called “peaso” and now sells through its online store – was “remarkable”, says food scientist Josh Evans, who was then at the Nordic Food Lab, a research institute attached to Noma. “The flavours were more than the sum of their parts; it had all of these amazing fruity aromas in it,” he says.\n\nYou don’t even have to ferment legumes to make new misos. In 2021, a team led by Eddy Smid at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands created a dairy miso by applying kōji to quark cheese. The result was a sweet paste with blue cheese notes.\n\nWilliams and others have also experimented with crossover fermentations of kombucha, traditionally made from sweetened tea inoculated with bacteria and yeasts. Various new substrates have been tried – herbal teas, coffee, ginger, fruit and vegetable juices, milk, and even waste products like whey and banana peel. “They develop these flavours that you would never find in raw, unfermented juice,” says Evans, who is now at the Technical University of Denmark, near Copenhagen.\n\nAnother space that is ripe for the filling: plant-based cheeses. Most vegan cheeses are simply unfermented blocks of oils and starches that don’t really mimic cheese. Those that are fermented score better in taste tests, but they still perform worse than dairy-based cheese.\n\nThat may be because the organisms used in the fermentation are standard cheese-making microbes, which aren’t adapted to non-dairy substrates. “They haven’t been optimised at all to, say, cashews or coconut,” says Dyer. Myconeos is currently screening its library of penicillins to find ones that reliably and deliciously ferment plant-based milks into cheese. “So you’re more likely to get vegan cheeses that taste more like the dairy originals,” says Dyer.\n\nAnother technique being used in crossovers is solid-state fermentation, where the microbes grow on a solid medium rather than in a liquid one. This is how the Javanese staple food tempeh is made, using moulds from the genus Rhizopus to ferment blocks of soybean. For the past few years, Contempehrary, a small company in Nykøbing Sjælland, Denmark, has been creating and selling Nordic tempehs made from split peas, fava beans and seaweed.\n\nTempeh is traditionally made in Indonesia by fermenting soybeans. New Nordic-style tempehs are made from split peas, fava beans and seaweed Contempehrary\n\nSolid-state crossovers have even been used to create entirely novel foods. In 2023, a research team led by Vayu Hill-Maini at Stanford University was experimenting with the filamentous mould Neurospora intermedia, which is the main fermenter in red oncom, a tempeh-like food from Java produced from pulp leftover from processing soybeans into tofu and soya milk.\n\nThey discovered that the fungus can convert rice starch to glucose, and so they created a solidified, unsweetened rice custard and surface-fermented it with N. intermedia for 60 hours. This created an intense sweetness, lots of interesting flavours and also turned the custard bright orange and fluffy due to the fungal spores. Hill-Maini shared the recipe with his collaborator Rasmus Munk, head chef at the Michelin starred restaurant Alchemist in Copenhagen, and he put it on the menu.\n\nMany of these crossover fermentations take substrates that would otherwise go to waste and turn them into edible products. That is one of the main motivations for developing novel fermentations, says Evans. Globally, around a third of food goes to waste, and food waste is responsible for around 8 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTraditional fermentation is already used to turn waste into food – red oncom is an example of this. But there are many other kinds of unused waste that could be fermented to create new foods. In Mexico, for instance, scientists have used agave bagasse – a byproduct of tequila – to create a new type of sourdough bread. Evans and his colleagues recently created a soy sauce fermented from the waste products of mushroom farming. Once the fruiting bodies have been picked, the underground parts of the fungus and the growing medium – often coffee grounds – are usually discarded, but that is a waste.\n\nPulp residue from the agave plant, used to make tequila, can be turned into ingredients for bread thanks new types of fermentations Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n“There’s a lot of flavour left, a lot of nutrition left, it’s just a question of how to unlock it,” says Evans. “We ferment it like a traditional soy sauce, and then you have this delicious mushroomy, coffee-y, intense soy sauce that’s super rich in protein, very nutritious.” He and his colleagues also tried fermenting the roots of Belgian endives, which are intensely bitter and usually left in the ground to rot. By wild fermenting the roots they produced something surprisingly good. “We got all these amazing citrusy notes, and we were like, oh, actually, we should make a tonic water with this,” he says.\n\nTransforming food waste\n\nAccording to Hill-Maini, Neurospora intermedia alone has the potential to transform many classes of food waste into edible products. He tried it on 30 different forms of food waste, including grain husks, the inedible parts of fruits and vegetables and various byproducts from food processing. It grew well on all but three of them. The goal now is to see which of these waste streams can be converted into foods that consumers will willingly eat.\n\nCrossover is far from the only option. Another technique being explored is engrafting, where the microbiome from one traditional ferment replaces another. Researchers at Japan’s National Agriculture and Food Research Organization in Tsukuba, for example, have been experimenting with brie-style cheeses ripened with kōji moulds. Traditional surface-ripened cheeses are coated with the mould Penicillium camemberti, which forms the cheese’s bouncy white rind and helps to develop its flavour. Replacing it with kōji moulds produces a finished product that is similar, but not identical, to Camembert. Researchers at the Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Dairy Biotechnology in China, meanwhile, are experimenting with using a different kōji mould, Monascus purpureus, in place of Penicillium roqueforti. The fungus is red and produces a red-veined cheese with a distinctive flavour.\n\nThese mix-and-match techniques also hold the promise of enhancing the health properties of fermented foods (see “Health boost?”).\n\nThe next frontier is to exploit microbes that haven’t been used before. Traditional ferments barely scratch the surface of microbial diversity. “There are probably many microbes out there that have the potential to generate completely new fermented foods, but we just haven’t been looking for them,” says Wolfe. “That’s another way to bring in novel flavours and novel properties.” Such products are already starting to see the light of day: a company called Lachancea in Raleigh, North Carolina, for example, brews beers with novel yeasts extracted from the guts of bumblebees and wasps.\n\nNew fermentation microbes\n\nThere is also the prospect of tweaking existing fermentation microorganisms to create something new and different. That is the route Dyer and his colleagues have gone down. For centuries, the moulds used to ripen blue cheeses were propagated asexually, but a few years ago, scientists at Myconeos managed to coax them into having sex. “Sex means that you get lots of variation in the progeny,” says Dyer.\n\nThanks to “fermentation 2.0”, new cheeses with incredible flavours are being created Ashley Cooper/Alamy\n\nThey crossed moulds from stilton, gorgonzola and roquefort, and then inoculated cheese with the offspring. “We got some that tasted a little bit like the parents,” says Dyer. “But then we got one that was way out there. We had some professional tasters in, and they said it was the best blue cheese they’d tasted.” That was the extraordinarily tasty Danish blue I tried in Nottingham – an intense explosion of flavour and aroma, blue to its core, but with no hint of the acrid ammonia or sweaty-socks notes that often come with that territory. Plus, some flavour notes I had never experienced before.\n\nMyconeos has also found a way to get Penicillium camemberti to breed sexually, creating the possibility of new surface-ripened cheeses. These, too, rely on strains that have been used for centuries.\n\nThere is a lot more to be discovered. Fermentation space is potentially vast, but largely unexplored. “We defined the space only by existing foods and microbes,” says Wolfe. “But I think there could be more beyond that. If someone starts making a food with completely different microbes and completely different substrates, that would be a whole new part of [the] fermentation space, something completely new. Not everything that we’ll find in those spaces will be delicious. But I see some exciting new foods in the future.” If they’re as good as the cheese, I’m all in.",
