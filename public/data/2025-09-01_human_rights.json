Those eligible are now able to access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time, paid for by the government, for their children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it was a \"landmark moment\" for working families, and that the scheme would \"put money back in working parents' pockets\". But parents say they are facing long waiting lists for places, with nurseries warning that staff shortages are limiting their availability.\n\nHow working parents can get 30 hours of free childcare Parents Josh Harper and Chloe Hart say their 18-month-old son Oakley's name was the first one on the waiting list at his new nursery in Altrincham. The £240-a-month saving on fees, which are falling from £1,130 to £889 because of the scheme extending from 15 hours to 30 hours of funded care, \"just releases that little bit of stress\", mum Chloe says. \"It is a significant saving and one that does really help us,\" dad Josh adds. Both teachers, the couple were keen to secure a place, aware that demand has been rising.\n\nChloe Hart Josh and Chloe put their son Oakley's name down on the waiting list for a new nursery before it opened\n\nThe government had estimated that about 70,000 extra places would be needed by this September to accommodate that increase in demand. The number of spaces is rising but availability varies across the country – and nurseries and childminders say inquiries for places have \"gone through the roof\" from families eligible for the extra funding. \"A few years ago, the percentage of families getting the funding was probably 20%, now I'd say it's nearly 95% of families,\" George Apel says as he shows me around the newly opened Altrincham Day Nursery, the Apel family's seventh nursery. \"Parents are having to be a lot more flexible with their acceptance of what days are available. Before, parents could try to match their childcare to their job, now they're actually matching their job to their childcare availability.\"\n\nFor Rachael Darbyshire, who lives in Bolton, the search for a childcare place for her return to work next summer has proved challenging. Although she started her search before six-week-old Gabriel was born, all of her local nurseries have waiting lists up until September 2026. \"It is a massive help and will bring our bill down from £1200 to around £800, but the biggest issue is that it is only great if you can actually get a childcare place,\" Rachael says. \"It's all well and good saying that there are these hours available, but if the childcare places are not there, then it's not really supporting women in returning to work.\"\n\nVanessa Clarke/BBC Rachael Darbyshire's local nurseries are all full until September 2026\n\nSome parents are going to extra lengths to make themselves eligible for the funded hours as early as possible. Rachel Williams, from Warwick, says she was thinking about the scheme before the birth of her twins in 2022, when doctors told her she would need a Caesarean four weeks early. She opted to have the procedure at the end of that March, rather than the beginning of April, so she wouldn't miss the deadline for being eligible for funded hours at the start of the April term. \"My friends all laughed at me, but it was a really conscious decision and it's definitely saved us thousands and thousands of pounds,\" she says. If the twins were born in April, they wouldn't have been eligible for funded hours until the September entry points. \"You shouldn't really have to be thinking about that,\" Rachel says.\n\nRachel Williams Rachel Williams selected her Caesarean date so that she would be eligible for the funded hours earlier\n\nResearch from the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) suggests that workforce issues could be a key barrier to delivering the promised offer to parents, with low pay and limited progression opportunities a constant challenge for staff. It is estimated the sector needs 35,000 more staff to provide the funded hours expansion, and the NFER says even if that figure is reached, there are likely to be regional discrepancies. The government says the number of staff delivering funded childcare in nurseries rose to 272,500 this year - up by 18,200 from 2024, which it said was the highest increase on record. It has been offering a £1,000 incentive for new recruits, or for people rejoining the workforce in some areas. But Mr Apel says \"retention is arguably more important than recruitment\". The nursery has started its own recruitment company because of the struggle to bring in and keep early years workers. The number of childminders has also been continuing its long-term decline, with Ofsted figures showing the numbers falling by 1,000 in the last year.\n\n'Free' childcare\n\nThere has also been confusion around what is \"free\" as part of the scheme, and what has to be paid for. The government-funded hours cover term-time only, and providers say the funding rates, particularly for children aged three and four, are lower than the costs. It means many nurseries are putting up their prices. A University of Bath study tracking fees over the past 18 months found that they have risen fastest in areas with the lowest government funding, which it says could deepen regional inequalities. \"Parents are phoning up, they're looking for this thing that's been called 'free', and then they are met with additional charges, for meals or nappies,\" says Sarah Ronan, from the Early Education and Childcare Coalition, which represents childcare providers and charities. \"The sector has been tasked with rolling out the biggest expansion of childcare in history, and they're doing it in a really constrained financial environment.\" She says without extra funding, providers may reduce the number of hours they can offer and pause their recruitment plans, further limiting the availability of places. Joeli Brearley, founder of the Pregnant The Screwed campaign group and the parent support programme Growth Spurt, says there is \"a tussle between parents and providers\" who are both struggling. \"For parents, it's really complicated, it's not really working,\" Ms Brearley says. \"We are hearing from parents who are moving their C-section day in order to fit in with the funding criteria, we're hearing from women who say they've gone to their midwife for a sweep to try and bring labour on faster, and people that are asking for inductions earlier just so they can fit with the funding criteria - and that is madness.\" A survey by Growth Spurt and Women in Data suggests that many parents are paying extra consumable fees of £15 a day. The government has issued guidance saying any additional costs need to be laid out clearly and are optional, but nurseries say charging for extras is the only way to make up the shortfall.\n\nVanessa Clarke/BBC The government estimates the sector needs 35,000 extra staff due to the funded hours expansion",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The government in England has been increasing the amount of free childcare it funds for working parents. Until now, parents could get 15 hours of free childcare per week during term time, but demand for places has been growing fast.\n\n**What happened** – Starting this year, eligible working parents can access 30 hours of free childcare per week for their children aged nine months to four years. This means parents can now get government help to cover twice as many hours, which can save families hundreds of pounds each month. For example, one family saved about £240 a month thanks to the new scheme. However, many nurseries are full, and long waiting lists are common because there are not enough childcare workers to meet the higher demand.\n\n**Impact** – This change helps working parents reduce childcare costs significantly, making it easier for them to return to work or work more hours. It also reflects the biggest expansion of government-funded childcare ever in England. But the shortage of nursery staff and places means not all families can use the extra hours right away. Some parents have even planned their babies’ birth dates to qualify earlier for the funding, showing how important this support is to families.\n\n**What's next step** – The government is trying to recruit more childcare workers by offering bonuses and supporting nurseries to keep workers. Still, experts say keeping current staff is just as important as hiring new ones. The number of childminders is falling, which adds to the challenge. The government and nurseries will need to find ways to grow the childcare workforce and increase places so that more families can benefit from the expanded funding.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – England’s new 30-hour free childcare scheme offers valuable financial help to working parents but needs more staff and places to meet growing demand fully.",
      "personality_title_fr": "L'Angleterre étend la garde d'enfants gratuite à 30 heures par semaine pour les parents qui travaillent",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Le gouvernement anglais augmente la durée de la garde d'enfants gratuite financée pour les parents qui travaillent. Jusqu'à présent, les parents pouvaient bénéficier de 15 heures de garde d'enfants gratuites par semaine pendant la période scolaire, mais la demande a rapidement augmenté.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Depuis cette année, les parents éligibles peuvent bénéficier de 30 heures de garde d'enfants gratuites par semaine pour leurs enfants âgés de neuf mois à quatre ans. Cela signifie que le gouvernement aide à couvrir deux fois plus d'heures, ce qui permet aux familles d'économiser plusieurs centaines de livres par mois. Par exemple, une famille a économisé environ 240 £ par mois grâce à ce nouveau dispositif. Cependant, de nombreuses crèches sont complètes et les listes d'attente sont longues en raison du manque de personnel.\n\n**Impact** – Ce changement aide les parents à réduire considérablement leurs coûts de garde d'enfants, facilitant ainsi leur retour ou l'augmentation de leurs heures de travail. C’est la plus grande extension jamais réalisée de la garde d'enfants financée par le gouvernement en Angleterre. Mais la pénurie de personnel et de places limite l'accès pour certaines familles. Certains parents ont même planifié la naissance de leur bébé pour être éligibles plus tôt, montrant l’importance de ce soutien.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Le gouvernement tente de recruter plus de personnel en offrant des primes et en aidant les crèches à retenir leurs employés. Pourtant, garder le personnel actuel est aussi important que d'en embaucher de nouveaux. Le nombre d’assistants maternels diminue, ce qui complique la situation. Il faudra donc développer la main-d'œuvre et augmenter les places pour que plus de familles profitent pleinement du dispositif.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le nouveau dispositif anglais de 30 heures gratuites de garde d'enfants apporte un soutien financier important aux parents qui travaillent, mais nécessite plus de personnel et de places pour répondre pleinement à la demande.",
      "personality_title_es": "Inglaterra amplía a 30 horas semanales la guardería gratuita para padres trabajadores",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – El gobierno de Inglaterra ha estado aumentando la cantidad de guardería gratuita financiada para padres que trabajan. Hasta ahora, los padres podían obtener 15 horas de guardería gratuita por semana durante el tiempo escolar, pero la demanda ha crecido rápidamente.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Desde este año, los padres que cumplen los requisitos pueden acceder a 30 horas de guardería gratuita por semana para sus hijos de nueve meses a cuatro años. Esto significa que el gobierno ayuda a cubrir el doble de horas, lo que puede ahorrar a las familias cientos de libras al mes. Por ejemplo, una familia ahorró unos 240 libras al mes gracias al nuevo programa. Sin embargo, muchas guarderías están llenas y hay largas listas de espera porque no hay suficientes trabajadores para cubrir la mayor demanda.\n\n**Impacto** – Este cambio ayuda a los padres a reducir significativamente los costos de la guardería, facilitando que puedan volver a trabajar o aumentar sus horas laborales. También es la mayor expansión de guardería financiada por el gobierno en Inglaterra. Pero la falta de personal y de plazas significa que no todas las familias pueden usar las horas extra de inmediato. Algunos padres incluso planearon la fecha de nacimiento de sus bebés para calificar antes para la ayuda, lo que muestra lo importante que es este apoyo.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El gobierno está tratando de contratar a más trabajadores ofreciendo incentivos y ayudando a las guarderías a mantener a sus empleados. Aún así, los expertos dicen que retener al personal actual es tan importante como contratar nuevos. El número de cuidadores a domicilio está disminuyendo, lo que añade dificultad. El gobierno y las guarderías deberán encontrar formas de aumentar el personal y las plazas para que más familias puedan beneficiarse completamente.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – El nuevo programa de 30 horas de guardería gratuita en Inglaterra ofrece un apoyo financiero valioso a los padres trabajadores, pero necesita más personal y plazas para cubrir toda la demanda.",
