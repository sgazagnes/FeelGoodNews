      "title": "Scientists found climate change hidden in old military air samples",
      "summary": "Old military air samples turned out to be a treasure trove of biological DNA, allowing scientists to track moss spores over 35 years. The results show mosses now release spores up to a month earlier than in the 1990s. Even more surprising, the timing depends more on last year’s climate than current spring conditions. It’s a striking example of how fast ecosystems are adjusting to a warming world.",
      "content": "By examining DNA preserved in decades-old air samples collected by the Swedish Armed Forces, scientists at Lund University in Sweden have uncovered clear evidence that the seasonal release of spores by northern mosses has changed dramatically over the last 35 years. The research shows that moss spores are now released several weeks earlier than they were in the past, highlighting how quickly natural systems can adjust as the climate warms.\n\nAir sampling in Sweden began in the 1960s as part of efforts to monitor radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing. At the time, the goal was strictly related to national security, not ecology. Yet the glass fiber filters used to trap airborne particles also preserved traces of DNA from pollen, spores, and other microscopic biological material. This unexpected scientific resource was identified by Per Stenberg, a researcher at Umeå University.\n\n\"The samples have proved to be an unexpected, unique and very exciting archive of DNA from wind-dispersed biological particles,\" says Nils Cronberg, a botany researcher at Lund University.\n\nMoss spores are appearing weeks earlier than before\n\nUsing this archive, the research team tracked changes in airborne moss spores across a 35-year period, focusing on 16 different moss species and groups. Their analysis revealed a striking shift. On average, mosses now begin releasing spores about four weeks earlier than they did in 1990, and the peak of spore dispersal arrives roughly six weeks sooner.\n\n\"It's a considerable difference, especially considering that summer is so short in the north,\" says Nils Cronberg.\n\nLast year's climate matters more than spring weather\n\nThe findings point to warmer autumns as a key driver of the shift. When autumn temperatures stay higher for longer, mosses have more time to develop their spore capsules before winter arrives. This extra development time gives the plants a biological kick-start, allowing spores to be released earlier once spring begins. One of the most unexpected results was what did not influence spore timing.\n\n\"We had expected that snow thaw or air temperature in the same year as spore dispersal would be crucial, but climate conditions the year before were shown to be the most important factor,\" says Fia Bengtsson, formerly a researcher in botany at Lund University, who is now at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research.\n\nA new way to track long-term ecological change\n\nBeyond documenting rapid ecological responses to climate change, the study introduces a powerful new approach for studying how plants and animals have changed over time. The same DNA-based method can be applied to other species that release biological material into the air. Because air samples have been collected from locations across Sweden, researchers can reconstruct ecological shifts over decades and compare trends from north to south.\n\n\"We anticipate that our results and knowledge about how nature has changed from the 1970s onwards will be part of the next report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the documented effects of climate change,\" concludes Nils Cronberg.",

      "content": "The global fashion industry is gearing up for a new level of transparency. One that might soon be sewn into the very labels of your clothes. By 2027, garments entering the European Union could be required to carry digital product passports (DPPs), offering consumers an unprecedented look into the environmental and social footprint of what they wear.\n\nThese digital passports, accessed through QR codes or smart tags, will reveal a garment’s full backstory: where it was made, what it’s made of, how much energy and water went into its production, and even who was involved at each stage. The move is part of the EU’s wider effort to stamp out greenwashing, the practice of making products seem more eco-friendly than they actually are.\n\n“As consumers place a higher premium on sustainability and transparency, the digital product passport could be a key tool to provide granular records about the environmental footprint of each piece of cloth,” said Asif Ibrahim, vice chairman of Newage Group of Industries in Dhaka.\n\nWhat’s driving this shift?\n\nThe $1.7-trillion global fashion industry has long faced criticism for its lack of transparency and its enormous environmental toll. While brands often boast about sustainability initiatives, a 2023 Greenpeace report found that many of these claims are misleading, especially when it comes to recycling.\n\nFor example, some companies highlight recycled content in their garments, but much of it comes from plastic bottles, not from textile waste, a practice that does little to reduce the industry’s dependence on virgin materials.\n\n“Providing authentic and traceable data from across the supply chain is key to stop the problem of greenwashing,” said Rezwan Ahmed, CEO of Aus Bangla Jutex Ltd, which produces accessories from recycled and organic cotton.\n\nBangladesh braces for the digital upgrade\n\nAs the world’s second-largest apparel exporter, Bangladesh will be deeply impacted by the EU’s new passport requirement. And while large manufacturers may be more prepared, many small and mid-sized producers are not.\n\nThat’s a problem, considering that smaller factories make up a significant share of the country’s more than 3,300 export-oriented garment manufacturers, according to Mapped in Bangladesh, a data initiative from BRAC University.\n\nMeeting the new passport standards will require major upgrades in both hardware and digital literacy.\n\n“Suppliers will need support from global fashion brands and development organizations to upgrade their capacity—while the government should incentivize the early adopters,” said Ibrahim.\n\nBlockchain meets the sewing machine\n\nTo tackle these challenges, several Bangladeshi manufacturers are partnering with tech companies like Aware, a Dutch firm that uses blockchain technology to track data securely and transparently.\n\nHere’s how it works: as fabric moves through each production stage, from cotton ginning to garment finishing, key data such as water usage, yarn count, and dyeing details are entered into Aware’s blockchain platform. Once verified by third parties, this data generates a QR code that consumers can scan to see the garment’s digital profile.\n\n“The manufacturers will have control over what they disclose to their brands and consumers—we want to give the manufacturers ownership of data,” said Md. Muyeed Hasan, Aware’s Bangladesh country manager.\n\nHelping small players get on board\n\nRolling out a digital passport system across thousands of factories is no small feat. That’s why local and international partners are launching pilot projects to help smaller businesses prepare.\n\nDigiProd Pass, a UK-based company, is working with the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) to develop training programs and tools that can simplify the transition.\n\n“We’re launching pilot studies and plan to train smaller businesses to help them adapt,” said Salauddin Sohag, managing director of DigiProd Pass.\n\nA turning point for fashion transparency\n\nThe digital product passport may sound futuristic, but it’s rapidly becoming a reality. And for an industry often criticized for opacity and environmental harm, it could be a game-changer.\n\nIf successfully implemented, these passports could empower consumers to make informed choices, pressure brands to back up their sustainability claims with data, and help regulators hold companies accountable.\n\nBut the passport’s success will depend heavily on global collaboration between brands, suppliers, governments, and tech innovators, as well as a commitment to support the entire supply chain, not just the biggest players.\n\nBy 2027, a quick scan of a clothing tag could tell you a whole lot more than size and price. It might just show the path toward a greener, more honest fashion industry.",

      "title": "Ford is retreating from EVs — but embracing grid batteries",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nFord, a century after it launched the modern automotive era, has given up on its early ambitions to charge into the electrified future.\n\nThe company announced that it will delete nearly $20 billion in book value to extricate itself from its EV investments, an eye-popping loss that amounts to one of the biggest corporate impairments ever.\n\nThe company, of course, views it differently: The move is a ​“decisive redeployment of capital,” it said on Monday, as it rolled out a string of related strategic changes alongside the write-down.\n\nThe pivot hits particularly hard in the southeastern Battery Belt, where Ford had invested in multibillion-dollar BlueOval plants to produce batteries and electric vehicles. The EV battery facility in Glendale, Kentucky, will lay off about 1,600 employees, and the local outlet Memphis Commercial Appeal reported that a Ford factory in Tennessee will hire around 1,000 fewer workers than previously planned, now that it is making gas trucks instead of electric ones.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nAs Ford retreats from EVs, though, it’s enthusiastically embracing battery-making — announcing plans to repurpose the Kentucky plant to fuel its entrance into the grid storage market. It expects to spend roughly $2 billion over the next two years to launch production of lithium iron phosphate cells and package them into 20-foot containers that hold at least 5 megawatt-hours of storage capacity, equivalent to a Tesla Megapack. The plan is to ship at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually by the end of 2027.\n\n“This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified, and profitable revenue stream for Ford,” the company said in a statement. Ford also plans to make cells for home battery units at its factory in Marshall, Michigan.\n\nFord recently cut a deal with partner SK On, the South Korean battery maker, to dissolve their joint venture. Ford will keep the Kentucky battery plant while SK On takes the one at the sprawling BlueOval City complex near Memphis, Tennessee. That means batteries will still be made in that factory, just not exclusively for Ford products.\n\n“They have built up battery manufacturing capacity, and now they need to do something with it,” said Pavel Molchanov, managing director for renewable energy and clean technology at financial services firm Raymond James. ​“While EV demand is languishing, U.S. energy storage deployments are skyrocketing.”\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nFord’s sunny rhetoric about a ​“customer-driven shift” can’t hide the sheer enormity of the blow to its overall business.\n\nAs of September 30, Ford’s accountants pegged its corporate value at more than $47 billion. Now Ford must lower that by $19.5 billion to reflect the dissolution of the joint venture agreement with SK On and the loss of planned EV models. The company will have to spend money to end production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, switch to producing a gas-and-battery-powered extended-range model, and retool factories for new, non-EV production.\n\nThe move comes as EVs account for just about 10 percent of new vehicle sales in the U.S., far below the global figure of 25 percent. Though EV sales reach new records each year, the rate of growth has slowed, and there’s little reason to expect momentum to improve given recent federal policy changes.\n\n“U.S. EV sales have never lived up to expectations,” said Molchanov. ​“That was true even while the tax credit was in place. Now, there’s no more tax credit, and EV sales have fallen off a proverbial cliff.”\n\nThe consumer EV tax credit ended in September as a result of the Republican budget law, taking away an incentive that helped lower or eliminate the premium for buying electric compared to a similar gas-powered model. Now, too, the average price of regular gasoline has dipped below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years, while residential electricity prices rose 13 percent over the first three-quarters of this year, much faster than inflation.\n\n“In terms of commodity prices, this is the worst of both worlds for EVs,” Molchanov said.\n\nEnergy storage soars as U.S. EV market falters\n\nFord’s announcement says a lot about the changing fortunes of EVs and energy storage in the U.S. right now.\n\nIt used to be that EVs were on the exponential growth curve, and stationary storage offered a modest side hustle for any leftover batteries. Now, between American automakers’ apparent inability to make affordable models and the Trump administration’s slashing and burning of federal EV incentives, that market is heading for some doldrums.\n\nGrid battery providers, by contrast, are seeing business surge. Revenue from Tesla’s energy division, home to the Powerwall home battery and Megapack for large-scale storage, grew 67 percent last year compared to 2023 and broke $10 billion for the first time, even as the company’s market-leading EV business lost revenue.\n\nOverall, the U.S. will install a record amount of battery capacity on the grid this year. Though analysts predict some dropoff over the next couple of years as the industry adapts to new federal anti-China rules, the utility-scale outlook through 2030 has actually increased 15 percent since the first half of this year, according to industry group American Clean Power.\n\nDemand from AI data centers plays a massive role in that: Hyperscalers are realizing that strategically placed batteries can unlock capacity at critical constrained hours, in some cases letting the companies build computing hubs years earlier than they could if they waited for conventional grid upgrades. Ford, not coincidentally, will target data centers with its new battery products.\n\nThe grid storage market has to date depended almost entirely on lithium iron phosphate cells made in China. But when President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” this summer, he preserved federal tax incentives for energy storage deployment while adding a new bureaucratic regime to make projects prove they don’t source parts from China in excess of newly set limits.\n\nStarting in 2026, that will push storage developers to source U.S.-made batteries. There aren’t a lot of options today: LG, after making EV batteries in Michigan for years, began producing lithium iron phosphate cells there for grid use earlier this year. Tesla, Fluence, and others are following suit — in fact, the U.S. is on track for self-sufficiency in cell production for grid storage use by the end of 2026, according to the Energy Storage Coalition.\n\nIf project developers end up in a race to secure scarce domestic supply come 2027 or 2028, Ford could find eager buyers in spite of its short track record.\n\nStill, that’s no guarantee of success. Other companies have been building grid storage products for years, working out kinks, packing more capabilities into a tighter footprint, and building relationships with savvy customers. Ford has a reputation for reliability in pickup trucks, not in grid batteries.\n\nPut another way, Ford is copying Tesla’s strategy of leveraging EV prowess to sell grid storage, but doing so a decade later and without the EV prowess to lean on.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Ford, a company known for making cars for over 100 years, had plans to make many electric vehicles (EVs). But EV sales in the U.S. have not grown as fast as expected, partly because of fewer government incentives and cheaper gas prices.\n\n**What happened** – Ford decided to stop making some electric trucks and cut back on EV production. Instead, it will use its battery factories to build large batteries that store electricity for the power grid. These batteries help store energy from sources like wind and solar, so power is available when it’s needed. Ford will spend about $2 billion over two years to make these grid batteries and plans to produce a lot by 2027.\n\n**Impact** – This change shows a big shift in how Ford is using its battery technology. While EV sales slow down, the market for batteries that store energy for the grid is growing fast. These grid batteries help keep electricity reliable and support clean energy. Ford’s move could help meet the rising demand for energy storage, especially as more places use renewable energy.\n\n**What’s next step** – Ford will start making these grid batteries in Kentucky and Michigan. It hopes to sell them to customers like data centers that need reliable power. The company will also adjust its factories to focus less on EVs and more on energy storage.

      "personality_title_es": "Ford cambia de coches eléctricos a grandes baterías para la red eléctrica",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Ford, una empresa conocida por fabricar coches durante más de 100 años, tenía planes para producir muchos vehículos eléctricos (VE). Pero las ventas de VE en EE. UU. no han crecido tan rápido como se esperaba, en parte por menos incentivos del gobierno y precios más bajos de la gasolina.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Ford decidió detener la producción de algunas camionetas eléctricas y reducir la fabricación de VE. En cambio, usará sus fábricas de baterías para construir grandes baterías que almacenan electricidad para la red eléctrica. Estas baterías ayudan a guardar energía de fuentes como el viento y el sol para usarla cuando se necesite. Ford planea gastar unos 2 mil millones de dólares en dos años para hacer estas baterías y producir muchas para 2027.\n\n**Impacto** – Este cambio muestra una gran transformación en cómo Ford usa su tecnología de baterías. Mientras las ventas de VE se desaceleran, el mercado de baterías para almacenamiento de energía en la red está creciendo rápido. Estas baterías ayudan a mantener la electricidad confiable y apoyan la energía limpia. El cambio de Ford puede ayudar a satisfacer la creciente demanda de almacenamiento de energía.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Ford comenzará a fabricar estas baterías en Kentucky y Michigan. Espera venderlas a clientes como centros de datos que necesitan energía confiable. También ajustará sus fábricas para enfocarse menos en VE y más en almacenamiento de energía. Este cambio podría abrir nuevas oportunidades comerciales.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Ford está alejándose de los coches eléctricos para enfocarse en fabricar grandes baterías que almacenan energía limpia para la red eléctrica, respondiendo a las necesidades y oportunidades del mercado.",
