      "summary": "Couple say screening for spinal muscular atrophy is crucial so children can get life-changing drugs.",
      "content": "A simple test could have given our son a very different future\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Lucy Jenkins in Driffield Share Save\n\nNino Travagli Photography Rosie and Wes, from Driffield, East Yorkshire, with Marley, five, and baby Meadow\n\nTwo children with a rare genetic condition will live very different lives because one was tested at birth and the other was not, their parents say. Marley, five, and Meadow, four months, both have spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a progressive muscle-wasting disease that can cause death within two years if untreated. But while Marley, who was diagnosed at five months, cannot walk or talk and needs help to breathe, Meadow is meeting all the milestones for her age after she was tested at birth and received life-changing gene therapy at the earliest opportunity. Their parents Rosie and Wes, from Driffield, East Yorkshire, are calling for all babies to be screened for the condition. \"The earlier you find out about newborn SMA, the earlier your life turns around,\" Rosie says. \"Marley has complex needs and needs full daily life attention. Meadow is going to live a completely normal life and will barely need any breathing support.\" The couple are backing a campaign by the charity SMA UK, which wants the disease to be added to a blood spot test that already checks newborn babies for 10 rare but serious conditions. At present, screening for SMA is only carried out on those who have a sibling with the condition. According to the charity, an estimated 47 babies were born with the condition in the UK in 2024, though about 1 in 40 people carry the altered gene that can cause the disease.\n\nSupplied Marley and Meadow both have type 1 SMA, the most severe form of the disease\n\nRosie and Wes say their world came \"crashing down\" when Marley was diagnosed with SMA at the age of five months. \"Marley has to have respiratory support every single day,\" Rosie says. \"He cannot eat orally so he's fed via a tube. \"He has a ventilator at night-time. He can't walk or talk.\" Marley was given Zolgensma, a life-changing gene therapy drug, at 16 months. According to SMA UK, the drug delivers a healthy copy of the affected gene to the body, but timing is critical because irreversible damage may have already occurred in the nervous system. Rosie and Wes say this means early detection of SMA is crucial for giving children the greatest quality of life possible. The drug was given to Meadow within a few weeks of her birth. For Rosie, hearing her daughter's diagnosis \"was a very hard pill to swallow\". But she is now hitting her developmental milestones. \"She is already rolling over back to front and front to back at four months old,\" Rosie says.\n\nSupplied Rosie (right) and her children at a session with therapist Lisa Speight\n\nIn 2018, the UK National Screening Committee (NSC) recommended against screening for SMA, citing limited evidence of long-term treatment outcomes and cost-effectiveness for the NHS. However, over the past few years it has carried out a review of the decision because of \"significant developments\", including new drugs. Further evaluation work is due to be carried out within the NHS. Meanwhile, testing for all babies is due to begin in Scotland in 2026 under a two-year pilot programme. Portia Thorman, from SMA UK, believes it would be ''ethically wrong'' not to introduce screening throughout the UK. \"I think facing a diagnosis now, you can be filled with hope,\" she says. \"Children are getting diagnosed much earlier than they used to be and there are three brilliant drugs that work incredibly well. The future for these children is bright.\"\n\nSupplied Prof Laurent Servais says screening would be \"extremely easy to implement\"\n\nLaurent Servais, a professor of neuromuscular diseases at the University of Oxford, carried out a study of newborn screening based on programmes in other countries, such as Belgium. \"In the US, in Europe, in Japan, in Australia, every single baby is screened at birth for SMA, even if there is no case in your family\", he says. A similar approach in the UK would mean children could be \"treated immediately, giving them a completely different future\". Prof Servais argues newborn testing is \"extremely easy to implement\" and the effectiveness of the treatment would outweigh the cost of screening. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"The UK National Screening Committee has recommended a large-scale study for spinal muscular atrophy screening in newborns to gather further evidence. \"This is under consideration and we are working closely with families and campaigners as part of this.\" Though Marley was not diagnosed at birth, his parents say he has made incredible progress due to drugs and physiotherapy. \"He's been doing really, really well. He couldn't sit up unaided when he first came here [to therapy], but now he can sit up unaided for three minutes,\" says Rosie. Marley has also started at mainstream school and can \"sit up in class in his chair and be like the other kids\". However, Rosie and Wes know Meadow's early test means her life is likely to be very different to Marley's. \"I think the guilt that eats me and my partner up, as well as other families of SMA, is massive,\" Rosie says. But she adds: \"If you've had a child that's been diagnosed with SMA, it gets better\".\n\nDownload the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare genetic disease that causes muscles to weaken over time. Without treatment, babies with the most severe form may die by age two. Currently, not all newborns in the UK are tested for SMA at birth.\n\n**What happened** – Rosie and Wes from East Yorkshire have two children with SMA. Their older son Marley was diagnosed at five months and faces serious challenges like difficulty walking and breathing. Their baby daughter Meadow was tested right after birth and received gene therapy quickly, helping her grow and develop normally.\n\n**Impact** – This difference shows how early screening can change a child’s life completely. Gene therapy works best when given early, before damage happens. Experts and a charity are now pushing for SMA to be added to routine newborn blood tests in the UK, where it is currently only tested if a sibling has SMA. Other countries already test all babies.\n\n**What's next step** – Scotland will start a two-year pilot program in 2026 to test all newborns for SMA. The UK government is reviewing evidence and may decide to introduce similar screening across the country. This could help many babies get treatment early and avoid severe symptoms.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Testing all newborns for SMA can allow early treatment that greatly improves children’s health and future.\n",

Actuellement, tous les nouveau-nés au Royaume-Uni ne sont pas testés à la naissance pour la SMA.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Rosie et Wes, d'East Yorkshire, ont deux enfants atteints de la SMA. Leur fils aîné Marley a été diagnostiqué à cinq mois et fait face à de graves difficultés comme des problèmes de marche et de respiration. Leur fille bébé Meadow a été testée juste après la naissance et a reçu une thérapie génique rapidement, ce qui l’aide à grandir et se développer normalement.\n\n**Impact** – Cette différence montre comment un dépistage précoce peut changer complètement la vie d’un enfant. La thérapie génique fonctionne mieux lorsqu’elle est donnée tôt, avant que les dommages ne surviennent. Des experts et une association militent pour que la SMA soit ajoutée aux tests sanguins de routine des nouveau-nés au Royaume-Uni, où elle n’est testée actuellement que si un frère ou une sœur est atteint. D’autres pays testent déjà tous les bébés.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L’Écosse lancera un programme pilote de deux ans en 2026 pour tester tous les nouveau-nés à la SMA. Le gouvernement britannique examine les preuves et pourrait décider d’introduire un dépistage similaire dans tout le pays. Cela pourrait aider de nombreux bébés à être traités tôt et éviter des symptômes graves.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Tester tous les nouveau-nés à la SMA permet un traitement précoce qui améliore grandement la santé et l’avenir des enfants.\n",

      "summary": "Scientists have identified new anti-aging compounds produced by a little-studied blood bacterium. These indole metabolites were able to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and collagen-damaging activity in skin cell cultures. Three of the compounds, including two never seen before, showed particularly strong effects. The findings hint at a surprising new source for future skin-rejuvenation therapies.",
      "content": "People invest significant time and effort into keeping their skin looking young through masks, creams and serums. Researchers have now identified naturally produced molecules with anti-aging potential that originate within the body itself. These three compounds come from a blood-dwelling bacterium and were shown to reduce both cellular damage and inflammation in laboratory-grown human skin cells. The results, reported in the Journal of Natural Products by the American Chemical Society and the American Society of Pharmacognosy, suggest a promising direction for future skin-aging treatments.\n\nScientists still have limited understanding of how bacterial by-products (called metabolites) circulating in the bloodstream influence human health. One group of metabolites, known as indole compounds, has attracted special interest because of their anti-aging, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. In 2015, researchers discovered a blood bacterium capable of producing these compounds and named it Paracoccus sanguinis. Chung Sub Kim, Sullim Lee and their team wanted to learn more about P. sanguinis and focused their study on its indole-functionalized metabolites.\n\n\"We became interested in P. sanguinis because blood-derived microbes are a relatively uncharted area of research,\" says Kim. \"Given the unique environment of the bloodstream, we believed that studying individual species like P. sanguinis could reveal previously unknown metabolic function relevant to health and disease.\"\n\nIdentifying New Compounds\n\nTo explore this idea, the team cultured a large quantity of P. sanguinis for three days and then extracted the full mixture of metabolites produced by the microbe. They used several analytical tools, including spectrometry, isotope labeling and computational approaches, to determine the chemical structures of 12 distinct indole metabolites within the mixture. Six of these had never been documented before.\n\nKim, Lee and their colleagues then examined whether the indole compounds could limit processes linked to skin aging. They added liquid solutions containing each metabolite to cultured human skin cells. Before treatment, the cells had been exposed to conditions that increased reactive oxygen species, which are molecules known to trigger inflammation and damage collagen.\n\nAmong the 12 indoles tested, three of them, including two newly identified ones, reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species in these stressed skin cells compared with untreated samples. These same metabolites also lowered the amounts of two inflammatory proteins and a protein involved in collagen degradation.\n\nPotential Pathway for New Skin Treatments\n\nBased on these early results, the researchers note that the newly characterized indole metabolites could one day form the basis for therapies that help counter the effects of aging on the skin.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the National Research Foundation of Korea, the BK21 FOUR Project, and the National Supercomputing Center.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long studied how the brain stores memories, focusing mostly on a part called the hippocampus. Memory storage is a complex process involving changes in brain cells and genes. Understanding how memories last for a long time is important for learning about brain health and treating memory problems.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers found that a chain of gene activity in the thalamus and cortex, two other brain areas, plays a key role in keeping memories stable over long periods. This process, called a thalamocortical transcriptional cascade, happens step-by-step and helps maintain memories beyond the hippocampus. The discovery was published in Nature on November 26, 2025.\n\n**Impact** – This finding is important because it shows that memory storage involves more brain regions than previously thought. Knowing how the thalamus and cortex work together to protect memories could lead to better treatments for memory loss conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. It also changes how scientists understand the brain’s memory system as a whole.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will now study how this gene activity can be influenced or supported, possibly leading to new ways to improve memory in people with brain injuries or diseases. Future research may explore drugs or therapies that target this thalamocortical process to help keep memories strong.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists discovered that a special gene process in the thalamus and cortex helps keep memories stable for a long time, opening new paths for understanding and treating memory problems.",

Cette découverte a été publiée dans Nature le 26 novembre 2025.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte est importante car elle montre que le stockage des souvenirs implique plus de régions cérébrales qu’on ne le pensait auparavant. Comprendre comment le thalamus et le cortex travaillent ensemble pour protéger les souvenirs pourrait conduire à de meilleurs traitements contre les pertes de mémoire comme la maladie d’Alzheimer. Cela change aussi la façon dont les scientifiques comprennent le système de la mémoire dans le cerveau.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques vont maintenant étudier comment cette activité génétique peut être influencée ou soutenue, ce qui pourrait mener à de nouvelles méthodes pour améliorer la mémoire chez les personnes ayant des blessures cérébrales ou des maladies. Les recherches futures pourraient explorer des médicaments ou des thérapies ciblant ce processus thalamocortical pour renforcer les souvenirs.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Les scientifiques ont découvert qu’un processus génétique spécial dans le thalamus et le cortex aide à garder les souvenirs stables longtemps, ouvrant de nouvelles voies pour comprendre et traiter les problèmes de mémoire.",
