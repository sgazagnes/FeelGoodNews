      "title": "A hidden star found where dust shouldn’t exist",
      "summary": "A mysterious cloud of ultra-hot dust around Kappa Tucanae A may finally have an explanation: a hidden companion star. The star’s extreme orbit carries it straight through the dust zone, strongly suggesting it plays a key role in keeping the dust alive. This finding could help astronomers untangle one of the biggest challenges in imaging Earth-like exoplanets. It also opens the door to discovering similar hidden companions around other stars.",
      "content": "About 70 light-years from Earth, a star known as Kappa Tucanae A has long puzzled astronomers. It is surrounded by dust heated to more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, glowing intensely while orbiting extremely close to the star. Under such conditions, the dust should not survive. It should either evaporate or be pushed away by the star's radiation in a short time.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Arizona believe they have found a crucial missing piece. They have identified a companion star that repeatedly passes through the same region where this unusually hot dust remains.\n\nA Record-Setting Discovery\n\nThe findings were published in The Astronomical Journal and led by Thomas Stuber, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. Using the European Southern Observatory's MATISSE instrument, the team achieved the highest-contrast detection of a stellar companion ever recorded with this technology.\n\nThis discovery gives scientists a rare natural \"laboratory\" for studying hot exozodiacal dust. This type of dust has become a major obstacle in the search for Earth-like planets around other stars.\n\nWhy Hot Exozodiacal Dust Is So Confusing\n\nHot exozodiacal dust challenges basic ideas about how planetary systems behave. The particles are incredibly small, comparable to smoke from a fire, and they orbit extremely close to their stars. The intense heat and radiation in these regions should destroy the dust almost immediately.\n\n\"If we see dust in such large amounts, it needs to be replaced rapidly, or there needs to be some sort of mechanism that extends the lifetime of the dust,\" Stuber said.\n\nA Problem for Finding Other Earths\n\nThe mystery becomes even more important because hot dust often appears around stars that scientists hope might host Earth-like planets. NASA's planned Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), expected to launch in the 2040s, is designed to block out starlight using advanced coronagraphs so faint planets can be seen.\n\nHot dust interferes with this process by creating what researchers call \"coronagraphic leakage\" -- scattered light that can hide the signals of potentially habitable worlds. Learning where this dust comes from and how it behaves will be essential for future planet-hunting missions.\n\nA Surprise Revealed by Interferometry\n\nTo investigate the system more closely, Stuber's team used interferometry, a method that combines light from multiple telescopes to simulate a much larger one. The researchers observed Kappa Tucanae A repeatedly between 2022 and 2024.\n\nThe international team initially planned to track changes in the dust over time. Instead, they uncovered something unexpected: a companion star moving on a highly elongated orbit. At its closest approach, it comes within 0.3 astronomical units of the main star -- closer than any planet in our solar system gets to the sun.\n\nA Stellar Laboratory Takes Shape\n\nAccording to Stuber, this finding changes how scientists view the entire system. Rather than being a simple mystery, Kappa Tucanae A now serves as a complex environment for studying extreme stellar interactions. The companion star travels far from the system before plunging back through the dust-filled inner region.\n\n\"There's basically no way that this companion is not somehow connected to that dust production,\" said Steward Observatory Associate Astronomer Steve Ertel, a co-author of the study. \"It has to be dynamically interacting with the dust.\"\n\nDecades of Technical Expertise\n\nThe breakthrough reflects years of leadership in interferometry at Steward Observatory. Its Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI), funded by NASA and located on Mount Graham, transformed the study of warm exozodiacal dust, which is less extreme than the hot dust seen around Kappa Tucanae A.\n\nThe instrument's stability and sensitivity helped establish Steward as a global center for exozodiacal dust research. This success attracted major support from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and private donors, and placed the observatory at the forefront of exoplanet science.\n\nBuilding the Next Generation of Instruments\n\nThat experience is now shaping future technology. Steward researchers are contributing to a new European nulling interferometer that will be 50 times more sensitive than earlier instruments.\n\nThe connection is personal as well as technical. Denis Defrère, who leads development of the European instrument, previously trained at Steward Observatory as a postdoctoral researcher and helped build the LBTI.\n\n\"Steward has established itself as the global leader to this kind of research, which is really critical for exo-Earth imaging,\" said Ertel, who received a NASA grant to study exozodiacal dust using the new instrument.\n\nNew Paths for Understanding Cosmic Dust\n\nThe Kappa Tucanae A system opens many new research opportunities. By examining how the companion star interacts with the dust, scientists hope to learn more about where hot dust comes from, what it is made of, how large the particles are, and how they are distributed.\n\nThe work may clarify whether magnetic fields trap charged dust particles, as suggested by Steward researchers George Rieke and András Gáspár. It could also test whether frequent comet activity replenishes the dust, a process studied by Steward researcher Virginie Faramaz-Gorka, who is also a co-author on the paper. Other, entirely different physical processes may also be at play.\n\nLooking Ahead to Future Discoveries\n\nThe findings suggest that other stars with hot dust may also host hidden companions. Researchers at Steward Observatory now plan to reexamine systems observed in the past, searching for stars that may have been overlooked.\n\nAs NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory moves closer to launch, discoveries like this provide essential insight into the environments astronomers will face.\n\n\"Considering the Kappa Tucanae A system was observed many times before, we did not even expect to find this companion star,\" Stuber said. \"This makes it even more exciting to now have this unique system that opens up new pathways to explore the enigmatic hot exozodiacal dust.\"",

NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU\n\nWritten by Margaret Deahn, Ph.D. student at Purdue University\n\nNASA’s Mars 2020 rover is currently trekking towards exciting new terrain. After roughly four months of climbing up and over the rim of Jezero crater, the rover is taking a charming tour of the plains just beyond the western crater rim, fittingly named “Lac de Charmes.” This area just beyond Jezero’s rim will be the prime place to search for pre-Jezero ancient bedrock and Jezero impactites — rocks produced or affected by the impact event that created Jezero crater.\n\nThe formation of a complex crater like Jezero is, well… complex. Scientists who study impact craters like to split the formation process into three stages: contact & compression (when the impactor hits), excavation (when materials are thrown out of the crater), and modification (when gravity causes everything to collapse). This process happens incredibly fast, fracturing the impacted rock and even melting some of the target material. Sometimes on Earth, the classic “bowl” shaped crater has been completely weathered and unrecognizable, so geologists are able to identify craters by the remnants of their impactites. Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more complicated — Jezero crater’s rim is located on the rim of another, even bigger basin called Isidis. That means there is an opportunity to have impactites from both cratering events exposed in and just around the rim — some of which could be several billions of years old! We may have already encountered one of these blocks on our trek towards Lac de Charmes. In the foreground of this image taken by the Mastcam-Z instrument on the rover, there is a potential impactite called a “megablock” that the team has named “Hyha.” We can actually see this block from orbit, it is that large! The team is excited to continue exploring these ancient rocks as we take our next steps off Jezero’s rim.",

      "content": "This artist’s concept depicts NASA’s Cassini spacecraft performing one of its many close flybys of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. By analyzing the Doppler shift of radio signals traveling to and from Earth, the mission precisely measured Titan’s gravity field. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nA key discovery from NASA’s Cassini mission in 2008 was that Saturn’s largest moon Titan may have a vast water ocean below its hydrocarbon-rich surface. But reanalysis of mission data suggests a more complicated picture: Titan’s interior is more likely composed of ice, with layers of slush and small pockets of warm water that form near its rocky core.\n\nLed by researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, the new study could have implications for scientists’ understanding of Titan and other icy moons throughout our solar system.\n\n“This research underscores the power of archival planetary science data. It is important to remember that the data these amazing spacecraft collect lives on so discoveries can be made years, or even decades, later as analysis techniques get more sophisticated,” said Julie Castillo-Rogez, senior research scientist at JPL and a coauthor of the study. “It’s the gift that keeps giving.”\n\nTo remotely probe planets, moons, and asteroids, scientists study the radio frequency communications traveling back and forth between spacecraft and NASA’s Deep Space Network. It’s a multilayered process. Because a moon’s body may not have a uniform distribution of mass, its gravity field will change as a spacecraft flies through it, causing the spacecraft to speed up or slow down slightly. In turn, these variations in speed alter the frequency of the radio waves going to and from the spacecraft — an effect known as Doppler shift. Analyzing the Doppler shift can lend insight into a moon’s gravity field and its shape, which can change over time as it orbits within its parent planet’s gravitational pull.\n\nThis shape shifting is called tidal flexing. In Titan’s case, Saturn’s immense gravitational field squeezes the moon when Titan is closer to the planet during its slightly elliptical orbit, and it stretches the moon when it is farthest. Such flexing creates energy that is lost, or dissipated, in the form of internal heating.\n\nWhen mission scientists analyzed radio-frequency data gathered during the now-retired Cassini mission’s 10 close approaches of Titan, they found the moon to be flexing so much that they concluded it must have a liquid interior, since a solid interior would have flexed far less. (Think of a balloon filled with water versus a billiard ball.)\n\nNew technique\n\nThe new research highlights another possible explanation for this malleability: an interior composed of layers featuring a mix of ice and water that allows the moon to flex. In this scenario, there would be a lag of several hours between Saturn’s tidal pull and when the moon shows signs of flexing — much slower than if the interior were fully liquid. A slushy interior would also exhibit a stronger energy dissipation signature in the moon’s gravity field than a liquid one, because these slush layers would generate friction and produce heat when the ice crystals rub against one another. But there was nothing apparent in the data to suggest this was happening.\n\nSo the study authors, led by JPL postdoctoral researcher Flavio Petricca, looked more closely at the Doppler data to see why. By applying a novel processing technique, they reduced the noise in the data. What emerged was a signature that revealed strong energy loss deep inside Titan. The researchers interpreted this signature to be coming from layers of slush, overlaid by a thick shell of solid ice.\n\nBased on this new model of Titan’s interior, the researchers suggest that the only liquid would be in the form of pockets of meltwater. Heated by dissipating tidal energy, the water pockets slowly travel toward the frozen layers of ice at the surface. As they rise, they have the potential to create unique environments enriched by organic molecules being supplied from below and from material delivered via meteorite impacts on the surface.\n\n“Nobody was expecting very strong energy dissipation inside Titan. But by reducing the noise in the Doppler data, we could see these smaller wiggles emerge. That was the smoking gun that indicates Titan’s interior is different from what was inferred from previous analyses,” said Petricca. “The low viscosity of the slush still allows the moon to bulge and compress in response to Saturn’s tides, and to remove the heat that would otherwise melt the ice and form an ocean.”\n\nPotential for life\n\n“While Titan may not possess a global ocean, that doesn’t preclude its potential for harboring basic life forms, assuming life could form on Titan. In fact, I think it makes Titan more interesting,” Petricca added. “Our analysis shows there should be pockets of liquid water, possibly as warm as 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), cycling nutrients from the moon’s rocky core through slushy layers of high-pressure ice to a solid icy shell at the surface.”\n\nMore definitive information could come from NASA’s next mission to Saturn. Launching no earlier than 2028, the agency’s Dragonfly mission to the hazy moon could provide the ground truth. The first-of-its-kind rotorcraft will explore Titan’s surface to investigate the moon’s habitability. Carrying a seismometer, the mission may provide key measurements to probe Titan’s interior, depending on what seismic events occur while it is on the surface.\n\nMore about Cassini\n\nThe Cassini-Huygens mission was a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and the Italian Space Agency. A division of Caltech in Pasadena, JPL managed the mission for NASA’s Space Mission Directorate in Washington and designed, developed, and assembled the Cassini orbiter.\n\nTo learn more about NASA’s Cassini mission, visit:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/\n\nNews Media Contacts\n\nIan J.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Saturn’s moon Titan was thought to have a large ocean beneath its surface, based on data from NASA’s Cassini mission in 2008. Scientists believed this because Titan’s surface is covered in hydrocarbons and seemed to flex in a way that suggested liquid water inside.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory reanalyzed Cassini’s radio signal data using a new method to reduce noise. They found that Titan’s inside is mostly ice with layers of slush and small pockets of warm water near its rocky core, instead of one big ocean. These pockets move slowly and create heat by rubbing ice crystals together.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery changes how scientists understand Titan’s structure and how it reacts to Saturn’s gravity. It shows Titan is more complex, with slushy layers that allow it to flex and produce heat. This means Titan might have small areas where conditions could support basic life, as these water pockets carry nutrients through the icy layers.\n\n**What’s next step** – NASA’s upcoming Dragonfly mission, set to launch no earlier than 2028, will explore Titan’s surface with a flying rotorcraft.
