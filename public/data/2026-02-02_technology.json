      "title": "This AI app can tell which dinosaur made a footprint",
      "summary": "Dinosaur footprints have always been mysterious, but a new AI app is cracking their secrets. DinoTracker analyzes photos of fossil tracks and predicts which dinosaur made them, with accuracy rivaling human experts. Along the way, it uncovered footprints that look strikingly bird-like—dating back more than 200 million years. That discovery could push the origin of birds much deeper into prehistory.",
      "content": "A newly developed app powered by artificial intelligence (AI) is giving scientists and the public a new way to identify dinosaur footprints left behind millions of years ago, according to a recent study. The technology aims to make sense of fossil tracks that have long challenged researchers.\n\nFor many years, paleontologists have studied ancient footprints while debating what kinds of animals created them. Some tracks may belong to meat eating predators, others to plant eating dinosaurs, and some have even raised questions about whether early bird species were involved.\n\nTurning Photos Into Instant Analysis\n\nWith the new DinoTracker app, researchers and dinosaur fans can upload a photo or drawing of a footprint using a mobile phone and receive an immediate analysis. The app evaluates the shape and structure of the track to estimate which type of dinosaur likely made it.\n\nFosilized dinosaur footprints offer valuable insight into prehistoric life, helping scientists understand how dinosaurs moved and behaved. However, earlier studies have shown that these tracks are often difficult to interpret because their shapes can be altered over time.\n\nMoving Beyond Traditional Methods\n\nIn the past, researchers relied on manually built computer databases that linked specific footprints to specific dinosaurs. Experts note that this approach could introduce bias, especially when the identity of a track was uncertain or disputed.\n\nTo address this problem, a research team led by the Helmholtz-Zentrum research centre in Berlin, working with the University of Edinburgh, developed advanced algorithms that allow computers to learn on their own how dinosaur footprints vary in shape.\n\nThe AI system was trained on nearly 2,000 real fossil footprints, along with millions of additional simulated examples. These extra variations were designed to reflect realistic changes, such as compression and edge displacement, that occur as footprints are preserved over time.\n\nWhat the AI Looks For\n\nThe model learned to recognize eight key features that distinguish one footprint from another. These included how far the toes spread, where the heel was positioned, how much surface area contacted the ground, and how weight was distributed across different parts of the foot.\n\nAfter identifying these variations, the system compared new footprints with known fossil examples to predict which dinosaur most likely made the tracks.\n\nWhen evaluated, the algorithm matched the classifications made by human experts about 90 percent of the time, even for species that are considered controversial or difficult to identify.\n\nUnexpected Links to Birds\n\nOne of the most surprising findings came from tracks that are more than 200 million years old. The AI detected striking similarities between some dinosaur footprints and the feet of both extinct and modern birds.\n\nAccording to the research team, this could mean that birds emerged tens of millions of years earlier than scientists have previously believed. Another possibility is that some early dinosaurs happened to have feet that closely resembled bird feet by coincidence.\n\nNew Insights From Scotland\n\nThe system also offered new clues about mysterious footprints found on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. These tracks were formed on the muddy edge of a lagoon around 170 million years ago and have puzzled scientists for decades.\n\nThe analysis suggests that these footprints may have been left by some of the oldest known relatives of duck-billed dinosaurs, making them among the earliest examples of this group identified anywhere in the world.\n\nOpening Paleontology to Everyone\n\nResearchers say the technology creates new opportunities to study how dinosaurs lived and moved across the Earth. It also gives the public a chance to take part in fossil research by analyzing footprints themselves.\n\nThe study was published in PNAS and funded by the innovations pool of the BMBF-Project: Data-X, the Helmholtz project ROCK-IT, the Helmholtz-AI project NorMImag the National Geographic Society and the Leverhulme Trust.\n\nDr. Gregor Hartmann of Helmholtz-Zentrum research center, said: \"Our method provides an unbiased way to recognize variation in footprints and test hypotheses about their makers. It's an excellent tool for research, education, and even fieldwork.\"\n\nProfessor Steve Brusatte, Personal Chair of Palaeontology and Evolution, School of GeoSciences, said: \"This study is an exciting contribution for paleontology and an objective, data-driven way to classify dinosaur footprints -- something that has stumped experts for over a century.\n\n\"It opens up exciting new possibilities for understanding how these incredible animals lived and moved, and when major groups like birds first evolved. This computer network might have identified the world's oldest birds, which I think is a fantastic and fruitful use for AI.\"",

      "title": "Scientists discover hidden geometry that bends electrons like gravity",
      "summary": "Researchers have discovered a hidden quantum geometry inside materials that subtly steers electrons, echoing how gravity warps light in space. Once thought to exist only on paper, this effect has now been observed experimentally in a popular quantum material. The finding reveals a new way to understand and control how materials conduct electricity and interact with light. It could help power future ultra-fast electronics and quantum technologies.",
      "content": "How can information move at incredible speeds, or electricity flow without wasting energy? Answering these questions has pushed scientists and technology companies toward quantum materials, whose behavior is governed by physics at the smallest scales. Building these advanced materials depends on understanding how atoms and electrons behave, an area where many mysteries remain.\n\nNow, researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), working with colleagues at the University of Salerno and the CNR-SPIN Institute (Italy), have made a significant breakthrough. They identified a previously unseen geometric feature inside a quantum material that alters how electrons move, in a way similar to how gravity bends light. The findings, published in Science, point to new possibilities for next-generation quantum electronics.\n\nWhy Quantum Materials Matter\n\nModern technologies rely on materials with extraordinary performance, many of which arise from quantum physics. This field focuses on matter at microscopic scales, where particles behave in surprising ways. Over the past century, research into atoms, electrons, and photons led to the invention of transistors and the foundation of today's computers.\n\nEven now, scientists continue to uncover quantum effects that challenge established theories. Recent research suggests that when huge numbers of particles interact inside certain materials, a kind of internal geometry can emerge. This structure can redirect electron motion, closely resembling how Einstein's theory of gravity describes the bending of light.\n\nFrom Mathematical Idea to Measured Reality\n\nThis internal structure is known as the quantum metric. It describes the curvature of the quantum space through which electrons travel and influences many microscopic properties of materials. Despite its importance, proving its existence experimentally has been extremely difficult.\n\n''The concept of quantum metric dates back about 20 years, but for a long time it was regarded purely as a theoretical construct. Only in recent years have scientists begun to explore its tangible effects on the properties of matter,'' explains Andrea Caviglia, full professor and director of the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science.\n\nDetecting a Hidden Geometry in Quantum Materials\n\nIn the new study, the research team led by UNIGE, together with Carmine Ortix, associate professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Salerno, detected the quantum metric at the boundary between two oxide materials, strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate. This interface is already known as a powerful platform for studying quantum behavior.\n\n''Its presence can be revealed by observing how electron trajectories are distorted under the combined influence of quantum metric and intense magnetic fields applied to solids,'' explains Giacomo Sala, research associate in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science and lead author of the study.\n\nImplications for Future Technologies\n\nBeing able to observe this effect allows scientists to measure a material's optical, electronic, and transport properties more accurately. The team also found that the quantum metric is a fundamental characteristic of many materials, rather than a rare exception as previously believed.\n\n''These discoveries open up new avenues for exploring and harnessing quantum geometry in a wide range of materials, with major implications for future electronics operating at terahertz frequencies (a trillion hertz), as well as for superconductivity and light-matter interactions,'' concludes Andrea Caviglia.",
