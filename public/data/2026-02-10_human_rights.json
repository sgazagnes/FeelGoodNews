      "content": "Josh Miele explains the nuances of a tactile map of a Bay Area Rapid Transit station.Credit: Laurie Udesky\n\nWorking scientist profiles This article is part of an occasional series in which Nature profiles scientists with unusual career histories or outside interests.\n\nFifty-seven-year-old Josh Miele is a blind scientist, an inventor of adaptive technology and a 2021 MacArthur Foundation ‘genius’ fellow. In the 1990s, as an undergraduate and graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) — before the invention of GPS — Miele could be seen around town climbing up street signs and feeling the embossed letters to work out which street he was on when travelling in unfamiliar areas, all to the surprise of bystanders. “Some accessibility is just about getting things done, and some accessibility is about teaching others about how much of a pain in the neck it is to get things done,” says Miele.\n\nStructural biology for researchers with low vision\n\nMiele was nurtured by his mother from a young age to buck the system. In his 2025 memoir, Connecting the Dots, he recounts a visit to an art museum, during which his mother urged him to get up close to a sculpture and “feel it with his hands”.\n\nAs he did so, he was mortified to hear his mother berating the museum staff for trying to deprive him of the hands-on experience. It was one of many instances of his mother making him “practise breaking the rules, thinking about when they needed to be broken and practising being visible, all of which are essential for me now”, says Miele, a polymath whose pursuits have included physics and space-science studies, working on a Mars probe and doctoral work on the psychology of sound perception. All of which would set him up for a career in designing accessible technology. Miele met a reporter from Nature’s careers team at his neat, compact woodworking studio in Berkeley, where he goes “to get out of his head”, carving chopstick holders and other things.\n\nOutspoken start\n\nMiele wasn’t born blind — a neighbour attacked him with acid when he was four years old, blinding and badly burning him. He reflects in his memoir that his young age probably protected his outlook: “I had a life to enjoy, and I couldn’t let being blind and burned prevent it.”\n\nInstead, the incident forced him to begin engineering the world around him in his neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York City, to make it work for him. He felt around his home to map it out, built a map of his neighbourhood in his mind and took apart radios and household appliances to understand how they worked. Miele used the echo of the sound his roller skates made to help him steer clear of objects that he might crash into while zooming down the pavement in front of his family’s house. At age 12, with a friend’s mother dictating instructions, he coded his first computer program, commanding an early home computer to count on screen from one to ten. In secondary school, inspired by the 1983 film WarGames “about a computer hacker guy with a talking computer” and with the help of his Braille teacher, Miele set up a speech synthesizer as a rudimentary screen reader on his home computer.\n\nSeveral years later, during his physics undergraduate degree, he helped to update the features of outSPOKEN, a software for people with low vision or who are blind that reads aloud what is displayed on a computer’s graphical user interface. The Mac version was originally released in 1989 by Berkeley Systems, a small, local software company.\n\nMiele got the job through his connection with Marc Sutton, whom he describes as “a laid-back blind hippie”. They met in The Cave, the basement of a UCB library in which blind students congregated to use Braille machines and other accessible equipment, talk about disability rights and learn from each other. Miele says that students worked and played hard at all hours in The Cave.\n\nWorking Scientist career profiles\n\nHis interactions with The Cave cohort and the wider disability-rights community marked a turning point for Miele. Before UCB, he says, “I didn’t think of myself as being part of a disability community. Why would I?” There weren’t any positive portrayals of blind and disabled people, in general, he says. With his new-found peers, he quickly realized that “we all deal with other people telling us that we can’t do stuff, building things that we can’t use and marginalizing us intentionally or unintentionally”.\n\nA long-term friend and colleague of Miele’s who is also blind, UCB English professor Georgina Kleege, says that outSPOKEN was the first screen reader she ever used — although she didn’t know Miele at the time. “It changed my life. It made my life possible, because it meant I could use a computer,” she says.\n\nIn 1993, Miele pursued an internship at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, indulging his childhood interest in rockets and outer space. There, he helped to develop software to calibrate optical sensors aboard the Mars Observer probe that launched in 1992. But the spacecraft disappeared before it entered Mars’ orbit.\n\nDeeply disheartened, Miele felt like physics was no longer the right place for him. Once back in Berkeley, he realized that building accessible technologies “was probably the most value I could add”, he says. “I knew that it would be fun. I knew it would be interesting. I knew that there was plenty of work to do.” So, he put his undergraduate studies on hold to work full time at Berkeley Systems.\n\nQuick-fire Q&A Josh Miele enjoys playing music.Credit: 2016 Barbara Butkus Why did it take 10 years for you to finish your undergraduate degree? Because I find classwork really unsatisfying. I am motivated by doing things that make a difference in people’s lives. I’m always thinking about problems that people with disabilities have and I learn about new technologies as they come along. Sometimes things come to me in the shower. Who are your greatest influences and mentors? My stepfather, a geophysicist, was one. He was incredible at explaining things to me. For example, when I was young, he laid out two ropes on a table for me to feel to explain the difference between the wave height and wave density of AM and FM radio frequencies. Science-fiction writer Ursula Le Guin is another, because she wrote and thought about people in unusual ways. And she’s a master of the pencil sketch with words. What drew you to playing guitar and being in a band when you were younger? I love music and enjoy performing. And I wanted to be cool. As young kids, aged 13–14 years, we formed a band called Child Labor. It was a play on ‘Men at Work’, a group that was popular at the time.\n\nA fresh direction\n\nEventually, Miele realized that he needed to return to UCB to finish his bachelor’s degree and did so in 1997. He’d already completed his physics requirements and spent his last semester taking courses in music appreciation, disability studies and psychology.\n\nIn 1998, he began his PhD in psychoacoustics and cognitive psychology at UCB. “I wanted to study ways of using non-speech sounds, including 3D immersive audio, to present information for screen-reader users, to speed up those interactions,” he says. For instance, he explains, imagine a screen reader reading out information in the top-left cell of a spreadsheet or table and it sounding like the voice was coming from the left and above the user. “It’s more efficient and intuitive than having the speech say ‘top-left cell’,” he says.\n\nThat same year, he started an internship at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute in San Francisco, California. There, he worked on the data-analysis software MATLAB, to make it accessible to blind people. His Smith-Kettlewell stint evolved into a 19-year relationship, both during and after his PhD.\n\nThe institute’s environment “was incredibly flexible and accommodating”, says Miele. “It was also one of the few research institutions in the world that valued the kind of accessibility technology research programme that I wanted to build.” His proudest work included developing a way for blind and partially sighted people to print embossed, or raised, tactile street maps for any US location — to get a full picture of a neighbourhood or address through their fingers. Miele started the project, called tactile map automated production (TMAP), in 2003 as a postdoc at Smith-Kettlewell.\n\nFor it, he repurposed coding that he had developed for his graduate work, which enabled him to print research charts and graphs in Braille. He applied the program to data from geographical information systems (GIS) freely available through the US Census Bureau. Other people had used GIS to create tactile maps, Miele explains, but these required visual interfaces. “They were sighted people making maps for blind people.”\n\nJosh Miele (standing) teaches a participant at a Blind Arduino Project workshop; he launched this series of maker gatherings in 2015.Credit: Jean Miele 2026\n\nTMAP enabled blind people to create a Braille printable map at the scale and location of their choice and on their own. “This revolutionized the availability of tactile street maps for blind travelers,” noted a Smith-Kettlewell announcement in September 2021 (see go.nature.com/3zabzja).\n\nSteve Landau is a close friend and frequent collaborator of Miele’s and the founder and president of Touch Graphics, an accessibility technology company in Newark, Delaware. The firm specializes in products that convey spatial information through touch. He has wrestled with Miele over the usability of the firm’s assistive technologies. Landau says that Miele can be blunt and has frequently “burst his bubble”, explaining why something he proposed won’t work.\n\nThese tools help visually impaired scientists read data and journals\n\nLandau worked with Miele on creating a digital version of TMAP known as the Talking Tactile Tablet (TTT). One disagreement centred on how people would use screen touching on the tablet. As a sighted person, Landau explains, he was overlooking the complex ways in which blind people swipe and rotate their fingers on surfaces. “I needed to be schooled to make the device as intuitive as possible.”\n\nThe TTT enabled users to print an embossed map to overlay the tablet’s screen. Then, by tapping a map area, the tablet would spit out spoken information, such as street names, the number of traffic lanes, the direction of traffic and the location of pedestrian crossings. The handheld tablet worked well even for people who don’t know Braille, Landau explains.",

      "summary": "On Monday, the Housing Committee adopted its final recommendations on the housing crisis in the EU, proposing solutions for decent, sustainable and affordable housing.Special Committee on the Housing Crisis in the European Union Source : © European Union, 2026 - EP",
      "content": "In its final report, adopted with 23 votes in favour, 6 votes against, and 4 abstentions, Parliament’s Special Committee on the Housing Crisis emphasises that millions of Europeans face precarious living conditions due to the housing crisis and calls for EU legislation to address the viability and cost of building new housing.\n\n\n\nImproving living standards\n\n\n\nTo ensure decent housing, MEPs want specific earmarks of the funds included in the Commission’s Affordable Housing Plan to improve the energy performance of the residential buildings and to combat energy poverty. All new dwellings should meet quality standards on insulation, energy-efficiency, and air quality, MEPs say.\n\nTo improve living standards in overcrowded cities, MEPs want the upcoming law on short term rentals to strike a balance between facilitating tourism and housing affordability to ensure the proliferation of short-term rentals does not threaten affordability in cities.\n\nMEPs also want an adequate share of public and social housing in EU cities to increase the affordability and supply of housing for vulnerable people.\n\n\n\nInvestments and fiscal aid\n\nMEPs urge member states to introduce incentive-based tax systems to support low- and middle-income households, remove tax barriers (i.e. high registration fees) for first time buyers, and make long-term rentals more affordable.\n\nThe report calls for more EU investment in housing by better coordinating existing funding and by reallocating unused Recovery and Resilience Plan resources to support the construction and renovation of social, public cooperative, and affordable housing.\n\nMEPs also say any revision of state aid rules should facilitate public investment in social housing, while respecting the diversity of national markets.\n\n\n\nFaster and easier procedures\n\nMEPs want the Commission to propose a housing simplification package to reduce red tape in the housing sector. They want simpler permitting procedures, for example through digital permit-granting procedures, and a deadline of 60 days when permits relate to sustainable and affordable housing proposals.\n\n\n\nIndustrial sovereignty in the construction and renovation sector\n\nThe EU must enhance its industrial sovereignty in the construction and renovation sector, MEPs say, urging the Commission to scale up innovative and sustainable products, reinforce the single market for raw materials, and include minimum ‘Made in EU’ origin requirements for components in EU co-financed projects.\n\nFinally, MEPs want the upcoming European strategy for housing construction to focus on improving the working conditions of skilled workers through training and fair wages. They call for easier intra-EU labour mobility, improved mutual recognition of professional qualifications and, where necessary, the recruitment of skilled workers from third countries.\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\nRapporteur of the housing report, Borja Giménez Larraz (EPP, ES), said: “The adoption of this report by the Housing Committee marks a significant step forward for the European Parliament. It reflects a broad and responsible consensus across political groups, grounded in pragmatism rather than ideology. The report places housing supply at the core of the response, recognising the need to enable the delivery of around 10 million additional homes across Europe. It also highlights the urgent need to support families and young people, who are bearing the brunt of the housing crisis. This balanced approach strengthens private property, provides legal certainty, creates the right framework for investment, and respects the diversity of national housing systems, while contributing to more affordable housing across Europe”.\n\nChair of the Housing committee, Irene Tinagli (S&D, IT), said: “Today’s strong endorsement of the report sends a clear message: we are ready to address housing as a social priority, strengthening cooperation between European, national and local authorities to tackle the crisis at its roots. The report sets out concrete measures across all dimensions of the housing challenge, including mobilising greater investment through EU, national and private funds, improving the quality, sustainability and habitability of homes, and addressing labour shortages and competitiveness in the construction sector. It reflects months of work and consultation by the Special Committee on the Housing Crisis, which will continue to monitor upcoming proposals and legislation to ensure that citizens’ interests remain at the core”.\n\n\n\nMedia briefing\n\nOn Tuesday at 17.00, Chair of the HOUS Committee Irene Tinagli (S&D, IT) and rapporteur Borja Giménez Larraz (EPP, ES) will participate in a media briefing in Strasbourg to discuss the report and answer questions from journalists. More details about the briefing here.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nOn 18 December 2024, Parliament established a Special Committee on the Housing Crisis in the European Union to put forward solutions for decent, sustainable, and affordable housing for all EU citizens. It has been tasked with mapping housing needs, analysing existing housing policies across the EU and contributing to the future implementation of the EU’s affordable housing plan.",

Esta diferencia puede afectar la confianza, la felicidad e incluso la duración de la vida.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Kate Pickett, profesora y autora de la Universidad de York, compartió su investigación que muestra que la desigualdad no solo es injusta, sino también dañina para la sociedad. Escribió un libro llamado \"La buena sociedad\", que invita a imaginar una sociedad sin conocer el propio lugar en ella. ¿Aún aceptaríamos los niveles actuales de desigualdad? Ella dice que ya sabemos qué hacer, pero necesitamos valor para actuar.\n\n**Impacto** – Este mensaje es importante porque conecta la desigualdad con problemas reales como la mala salud y la falta de confianza entre las personas. Lleva la conversación más allá del dinero para pensar en cómo la sociedad puede ser mejor para todos. Anima a pensar en la justicia y a elegir políticas que ayuden a todos a prosperar.\n\n**Próximo paso** – El siguiente paso es usar estas ideas para guiar las decisiones en comunidades y gobiernos. Al enfocarse en la justicia y el bienestar humano, las políticas pueden reducir la desigualdad y mejorar la vida de muchas personas.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – La investigación y el libro de Kate Pickett nos invitan a trabajar juntos para construir una sociedad donde la justicia y el bienestar sean más importantes que solo la riqueza.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Venezuela has many people in jail because they took part in protests or spoke out against government leaders. These prisoners are often called political prisoners.\n\n**What happened** – The Venezuelan government has created a draft law that could free these political prisoners quickly. This law is still a proposal, but it suggests granting immediate clemency, which means pardoning or letting these people go without waiting for long legal processes. A group of experts from the United Nations (UN) has welcomed this idea but said it is important that the people of Venezuela are involved in deciding how the law is used.\n\n**Impact** – This draft law could help many people who have been jailed just for expressing their opinions or joining protests. It is important because it could improve human rights and fairness in Venezuela. The support from the UN experts adds trust and shows that the international community is paying attention. This law could change how political freedom works in the country.\n\n**What’s next step** – The draft law still needs to be discussed and approved by Venezuela’s government and lawmakers. The Venezuelan people’s opinions will be key in shaping the final version. If passed, it may lead to the release of many political prisoners and could start a new chapter in Venezuela’s political life.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new draft law in Venezuela aims to free political prisoners quickly, with support from the UN and an emphasis on involving the people in the process.",
