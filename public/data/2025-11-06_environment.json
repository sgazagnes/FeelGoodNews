      "summary": "Scientists discovered 6-million-year-old ice in Antarctica, offering the oldest direct record of Earth’s ancient atmosphere and climate. The finding reveals a dramatic cooling trend and promises insights into greenhouse gas changes over millions of years.",
      "content": "In a breakthrough for climate science, a team of U.S. researchers has identified the oldest directly dated ice and air ever discovered on Earth. The samples were found in the Allan Hills region of East Antarctica, an area long known to preserve ancient ice near the surface.\n\nAccording to a study published on October 28 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the ice is about 6 million years old. Tiny air bubbles sealed within the ice provide a rare and direct glimpse into Earth's ancient atmosphere, offering scientists an unmatched record of the planet's past climate.\n\nA Glimpse Into a Warmer Ancient World\n\nThe oldest sample collected from the Allan Hills dates back 6 million years, a period when geological records indicate Earth was significantly warmer and sea levels were much higher than they are today.\n\nThe research effort was led by Sarah Shackleton of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and John Higgins of Princeton University. Both are part of the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Oldest Ice Exploration (COLDEX), a multi-institution collaboration of 15 U.S. research partners coordinated by Oregon State University.\n\n\"Ice cores are like time machines that let scientists take a look at what our planet was like in the past,\" explained Shackleton, who has worked on several Antarctic drilling expeditions. \"The Allan Hills cores help us travel much further back than we imagined possible.\"\n\nEd Brook, COLDEX Director and paleoclimatologist at Oregon State University, described the find as the center's most important discovery so far. The NSF Science and Technology Center, established in 2021, was created to explore the Antarctic ice sheet, the largest reservoir of frozen water on Earth.\n\n\"We knew the ice was old in this region,\" Brook said. \"Initially, we had hoped to find ice up to 3 million years old, or maybe a little older, but this discovery has far exceeded our expectations.\"\n\nA Global Race to Reach Deeper Into Time\n\nCOLDEX is among several international teams striving to extend the ice core record beyond its previous 800,000-year limit. A European project recently announced a continuous deep core reaching 1.2 million years in East Antarctica, but the Allan Hills samples push the timeline back several million years further, though in discrete fragments rather than a single continuous core.\n\nThe COLDEX researchers work at a remote field site in the Allan Hills, spending months drilling through one to two hundred meters of ice near the edge of the Antarctic ice sheet. In this region, rugged terrain and ice flow patterns act together to preserve extremely old ice closer to the surface. By contrast, obtaining continuous cores from the Antarctic interior typically requires drilling to depths of more than 2,000 meters.\n\n\"We're still working out the exact conditions that allow such ancient ice to survive so close to the surface,\" said Shackleton. \"Along with the topography, it's likely a mix of strong winds and bitter cold. The wind blows away fresh snow, and the cold slows the ice to almost a standstill. That makes Allan Hills one of the best places in the world to find shallow old ice, and one of the toughest places to spend a field season.\"\n\nThe age of the Allan Hills samples was determined directly from the ice itself using precise measurements of an isotope of the noble gas argon. This approach allows scientists to date the ice without relying on surrounding sediments or other indirect evidence.\n\nAlthough the record is not continuous, the samples are far older than any previously studied ice. As Higgins noted, \"Tthe team has built up a library of what we call 'climate snapshots' roughly six times older than any previously reported ice core data, complementing the more detailed younger data from cores in the interior of Antarctica.\"\n\nReconstructing 6 Million Years of Cooling\n\nAnalysis of oxygen isotopes in the ice revealed that the region cooled by about 12 degrees Celsius (roughly 22 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 6 million years. This is the first direct evidence quantifying how much Antarctica's climate has cooled since that ancient warm period.\n\nFuture research will focus on reconstructing concentrations of greenhouse gases and ocean heat levels preserved within the ice bubbles -- key clues to understanding the natural forces driving long-term climate change.\n\nA new COLDEX expedition is scheduled to return to the Allan Hills in the coming months for additional drilling. The team hopes to recover even older samples and produce a more detailed record of Earth's ancient atmosphere.\n\n\"Given the spectacularly old ice we have discovered at Allan Hills, we also have designed a comprehensive longer-term new study of this region to try to extend the records even further in time, which we hope to conduct between 2026 and 2031,\" Brook said.\n\nCollaboration and Support\n\nContributors to the study include Julia Marks Peterson, Christo Buizert, and Jenna Epifanio of Oregon State; Valens Hishamunda, Austin Carter, and Michael Bender of Princeton; Lindsey Davidge, Eric Steig, and Andrew Schauer of the University of Washington; Sarah Aarons, Jacob Morgan, and Jeff Severinghaus of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego; Andrei V.

      "title": "Turning CO2 into clean fuel faster and cheaper",
      "summary": "A new copper-magnesium-iron catalyst transforms CO2 into CO at low temperatures with record-breaking efficiency and stability. The discovery paves the way for affordable, scalable production of carbon-neutral synthetic fuels.",
      "content": "A team of scientists led by Dr. Kee Young Koo from the Hydrogen Research Department at the Korea Institute of Energy Research (President Yi Chang-Keun, hereafter referred to as KIER) has created a world-leading catalyst capable of transforming carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, into an essential ingredient for producing eco-friendly fuels.\n\nThe reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a chemical process that converts carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H 2 O) by reacting it with hydrogen (H 2 ) in a reactor. The resulting carbon monoxide can then be combined with hydrogen to make syngas, a fundamental building block used to produce synthetic fuels such as e-fuels* and methanol. Because of its ability to recycle CO 2 into usable fuel components, the RWGS reaction is seen as a promising pathway for advancing sustainable energy production.\n\nOvercoming the Limits of Conventional Catalysts\n\nTraditionally, the RWGS reaction operates best at temperatures above 800 °C. Nickel-based catalysts are often used because they can withstand such heat, but they lose performance over time as particles clump together, reducing surface area and efficiency. Operating at lower temperatures avoids this problem, but it also leads to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as methane, lowering carbon monoxide output.\n\nTo make the process more efficient and affordable, researchers have been searching for catalysts that remain highly active under low-temperature conditions. The KIER team succeeded by developing a new copper-based catalyst that delivers outstanding results at just 400 °C.\n\nA Breakthrough in Copper Catalyst Design\n\nThe newly engineered copper-magnesium-iron mixed oxide catalyst outperformed commercial copper catalysts, producing carbon monoxide 1.7 times faster and with a 1.5 times higher yield at 400 °C.\n\nCopper catalysts have a key advantage over nickel: they can selectively produce only carbon monoxide at temperatures below 400 °C without forming methane. However, copper's thermal stability typically weakens near that temperature, leading to particle agglomeration and loss of activity.\n\nTo solve this challenge, Dr. Koo's team incorporated a layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure into their design. This layered structure contains thin metal sheets with water molecules and anions between them. By adjusting the ratio and type of metal ions, the researchers fine-tuned the catalyst's physical and chemical characteristics. Adding iron and magnesium helped fill the gaps between copper particles, effectively preventing clumping and improving heat resistance.\n\nReal-time infrared analysis and reaction testing revealed why the new catalyst performs so well. Conventional copper catalysts convert CO 2 into carbon monoxide through intermediate compounds called formates. The new material, however, bypasses these intermediates entirely, converting CO 2 directly into CO on its surface. Because it avoids side reactions that produce methane or other byproducts, the catalyst maintains high activity even at a relatively low temperature of 400 °C.\n\nRecord Performance and Global Significance\n\nAt 400 °C, the catalyst achieved a carbon monoxide yield of 33.4% and a formation rate of 223.7 micromoles per gram of catalyst per second (μmol·gcat⁻¹·s⁻¹), maintaining stability for over 100 continuous hours. These results represent a 1.7-fold higher formation rate and a 1.5-fold higher yield than standard copper catalysts. When compared to platinum-based catalysts, which are costly but highly active, the new catalyst still outperformed them with a 2.2-fold faster formation rate and a 1.8-fold higher yield. This places it among the top-performing CO 2 conversion catalysts in the world.\n\n\"The low-temperature CO 2 hydrogenation catalyst technology is a breakthrough achievement that enables the efficient production of carbon monoxide using inexpensive and abundant metals,\" said Dr. Kee Young Koo, the project's lead researcher. \"It can be directly applied to the production of key feedstocks for sustainable synthetic fuels. Moving forward, we will continue our research to expand its application to real industrial settings, thereby contributing to the realization of carbon neutrality and the commercialization of sustainable synthetic fuel production technologies.\"\n\nNotes\n\n* E-Fuels are synthetic fuels produced by combining green hydrogen, generated with renewable electricity, and captured CO 2 from the atmosphere or sustainable biomass. They are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuels, especially for hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as aviation and shipping.\n\nThe research findings were published online in May 2025 in Applied Catalysis B: Environmental and Energy, a leading journal in the field of energy and environmental catalysis. The study was supported by the KIER's R&D project, 'Development of e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production technology from carbon dioxide and hydrogen.",

Une méthode est la réaction inverse du gaz à l'eau (RWGS), qui transforme le CO2 en monoxyde de carbone (CO), un élément clé pour les carburants synthétiques.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Des chercheurs de l'Institut coréen de recherche sur l'énergie (KIER), dirigés par le Dr Kee Young Koo, ont créé un nouveau catalyseur composé de cuivre, magnésium et fer. Ce catalyseur fonctionne à une température plus basse (400 °C) que d'habitude et transforme le CO2 en CO plus rapidement et efficacement que les anciens catalyseurs. Il reste stable et ne produit pas de sous-produits indésirables comme le méthane.\n\n**Impact** – Ce nouveau catalyseur est important car il utilise des métaux moins chers et fonctionne bien à basse température, ce qui économise de l'énergie et réduit les coûts. Il produit 1,7 fois plus de CO et est 1,5 fois plus efficace que les catalyseurs en cuivre actuels, et surpasse même les catalyseurs en platine coûteux. Cela rend la production de carburants synthétiques propres à partir de CO2 plus abordable et plus facile à grande échelle.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L'équipe de recherche prévoit de tester le catalyseur dans des conditions industrielles réelles pour aider à produire des carburants synthétiques durables comme les e-carburants. Ces carburants combinent de l'hydrogène vert et du CO2 et pourraient remplacer les carburants fossiles dans des secteurs difficiles comme l'aviation et la navigation.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Un nouveau catalyseur à base de cuivre convertit efficacement le CO2 en ingrédients pour carburants propres à basse température, rendant la production de carburants synthétiques durable moins chère et plus pratique.",

      "title": "Why cities around the world are uniting to keep cool",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "The following is a sponsored op-ed written by Kate Gallego, Mayor of Phoenix, Arizona and Joy Belmonte, Mayor of Quezon City, the Philippines and sponsored by C40 Cities.\n\nThis summer, cities around the world broke temperature records once again. The results were devastating: Extreme heat now kills nearly half a million people each year, and the danger keeps rising. By 2050, the number of people in cities exposed to life-threatening heat is expected to increase fivefold.\n\nFrom the desert of Phoenix in the United States to the humid streets of Quezon City in the Philippines, mayors are facing the same new reality: Heat is here to stay, and it is impacting every element of city life. That’s why we — along with more than 30 other mayors from C40 Cities, a global network of nearly 100 of the world’s biggest cities tackling the climate emergency — are joining forces to protect our people today and prepare our communities for a hotter tomorrow. Through the new C40 Cool Cities Accelerator, we’ll work together to speed up bold and inclusive climate action that meets the urgency of this growing threat.\n\nIn some ways, our cities couldn’t be more different. Phoenix, America’s fifth largest city, sits in Arizona’s Sonoran Desert, and sees more than 300 days of sunshine a year. Quezon City, the most populous city in the Philippines, faces sweltering humidity and the annual risk of typhoons. Yet both cities are on the front lines of rising temperatures that threaten health, strain our power grids, and deepen inequality.\n\nExtreme heat is the deadliest climate hazard, but it’s also the quietest. It kills through heatstroke and dehydration, and by worsening heart and respiratory conditions. It’s often felt most by the people with the fewest resources to cope: older adults, children, outdoor workers, and low-income communities. In Phoenix, residents in low-income neighbourhoods can experience temperatures several degrees higher than in wealthier parts of the city. In Quezon City, densely populated neighborhoods can become dangerous heat traps.\n\nView towards Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City, the Philippines.\n\nMarcus Lindstrom / Getty Images\n\nWe refuse to accept a future in which a heatwave becomes a death sentence for those with the least, and whose responsibility for the climate crisis is disproportionately small. The Cool Cities Accelerator is our shared plan to prevent that. In line with COP30’s call for a ‘decade of delivery,’ this provides a practical framework for mayors to act boldly and share what works.\n\nFirst, we’re protecting lives right now. Participating cities are appointing heat leaders, improving early-warning systems, and coordinating emergency responses across agencies. Phoenix, for example, created the US’s first publicly-funded Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, expanded access to chilled water stations, and opened cooling and hydration stations, including overnight cooling center options to bring relief where it’s needed most. Meanwhile, Quezon City is currently mapping heat-vulnerable communities and developing a citywide heat-health action plan. It has already adjusted work hours for outdoor workers, and introduced heat-tolerant crops across more than 1,400 urban farms.\n\nThe goal is to build long-term resilience. Within five years, cities in the Accelerator will integrate cooling into building codes, redesign streets for shade and airflow, and expand tree canopies and green corridors. Phoenix is piloting reflective ‘cool pavements’, planting thousands of trees, and building artistic shade structures and setting regional standards for heat-ready infrastructure. Quezon City is restoring parks and greening schools and public spaces. As part of these efforts, the city has supported local groups turning vacant lots into small forests and gardens, while encouraging private development to adopt greener designs under its Green Building Ordinance. These efforts save lives, and cut energy bills while improving neighbourhoods.\n\nBut urban heat doesn’t stop at city limits, and neither should our solutions. That’s why collaboration is at the heart of the Cool Cities Accelerator. Thirty-two cities — from Austin to Athens and Singapore to Santiago — are now exchanging data and design ideas. The details on the ground obviously differ, but the solutions we craft together are remarkably similar, creating more shade, better design, and better care for the most vulnerable. When our teams share lessons on early-warning systems, or how to engage with our communities, we all move faster and more effectively.\n\nFor too long, extreme heat has been under-measured and under-estimated. We can build cities that are not only cooler, but more fair. But to do so, we must act together, and we must act now. We need to deliver solutions that both keep people alive today, and allow future generations to thrive.\n\nC40 is a network of nearly 100 mayors of the world’s leading cities working to deliver the urgent action needed right now to confront the climate crisis and create a future where everyone, everywhere, can thrive. Mayors of C40 cities are committed to using a science-based and people-focused approach to limit global heating in line with the Paris Agreement and build healthy, equitable and resilient communities.",

Rising temperatures cause health problems and even death, especially for people who have fewer resources to stay cool. Experts expect that by 2050, many more city residents will be exposed to dangerous heat.\n\n**What happened** – Mayors from over 30 major cities, including Phoenix in the USA and Quezon City in the Philippines, have joined forces through the C40 Cool Cities Accelerator. This program helps cities share ideas and take fast, strong action to protect people from heat. Cities are creating heat-warning systems, opening cooling centers, planting trees, and changing building rules to make cities cooler and safer.\n\n**Impact** – This effort is important because it focuses on saving lives now and making cities stronger for the future. It also helps reduce unfair differences, since heat hits poorer neighborhoods hardest. For example, Phoenix offers public water stations and cooling centers, while Quezon City maps vulnerable areas and supports urban farms with heat-resistant crops. These actions reduce health risks and lower energy costs.\n\n**What’s next step** – Over the next five years, cities in the program will add more green spaces, redesign streets for shade and airflow, and improve buildings to handle heat better. They will keep sharing data and ideas so solutions can spread to more places. The goal is to create cooler, healthier, and fairer cities for everyone.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – City leaders worldwide are working together to fight rising heat by improving safety, fairness, and the environment in urban areas.\n",
