      "content": "How a 'swimming cap' could transform care for brain-injured babies\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Janine Machin East of England technology correspondent, in Cambridge Share Save\n\nBBC Researchers say their \"swimming cap\", which uses light and ultrasound to improve brain monitoring in newborns, is the first of its kind in the world\n\nThree-week-old Theo is fast asleep in a cot, unaware he is helping to trial new technology that could change the lives of others. Dr Flora Faure is gently fitting him with a small black cap that looks like a swimming cap, or something a rugby forward might wear. It is covered with hexagonal lumps, containing technology that monitors how his brain is working. Researchers at the Rosie Maternity Hospital in Cambridge say they are the first in the world to trial a new technique that could speed up diagnosis and care for children with conditions such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy and learning difficulties. It could be available in UK hospitals within the decade. \"It's the first time that light and ultrasound have been used together like this to give a more complete picture of the brain,\" says Dr Faure, a researcher from the Fusion (Functional UltraSound integrated with Optical Imaging in Neonates) study. In the weeks leading up to and following birth, our brains change every day. Brain injury in newborns is a major reason for lifelong disability, and a programme to reduce brain injury in childbirth is currently being rolled out across the NHS. The injury can affect the brain's ability to communicate with the body, leading to conditions such as epilepsy, which causes seizures, or cerebral palsy, which affects movement and coordination. It is more common in premature births but can be caused by a number of issues, including oxygen deprivation, haemorrhage, infection or birth trauma. But for the five in every 1,000 babies who have a brain injury, the current monitoring methods struggle to predict how and to what extent the child will be affected as they grow.\n\nResearcher Dr Flora Faure welcomes baby Theo and his mother Stani Georgieva on to the Fusion study trial\n\nExplaining how the cap works, Dr Faure says: \"The light sensors monitor changes in oxygen around the surface of the brain - a technique known as high-density diffuse optical tomography - and the functional ultrasound allows us to image the small blood vessels deep in the brain.\" But the device is also different because it is portable, so it can monitor babies more regularly, and from the comfort of their cot.\n\nConsultant neurosurgeon Dr Alexis Joannides believes it could have several advantages over the traditional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CUS (cranial ultrasound) scans. \"MRI has limitations for two reasons: one is the cost and availability of scan slots,\" he explains. \"The other is that you have to take the baby to a noisy scanner, wait maybe 20 minutes for the scan and then take the baby back again. \"It means, realistically, you can't perform a series of scans, but in those first weeks, the brain can change daily so having a way of doing repeated tests is incredibly powerful.\" MRI and CUS are also considered to have limited ability to predict the nature of any impairment due to the complex relationship between brain structure and function, although a study led by Imperial College London in 2018 reported that accuracy could be enhanced with an additional 15-minute scan.\n\nThe technology can be brought to the cot, which improves comfort for the baby and allows for scans to be repeated frequently\n\nBy conducting regular tests on infants, it is hoped that problems will be identified much earlier, and therapies and interventions can begin sooner. The charity Action Cerebral Palsy has welcomed the research. \"For many children with cerebral palsy, the road to diagnosis is a long one, and families can spend years knowing their child is 'at risk' of developmental issues but not fully understanding what that will mean,\" says its founder Amanda Richardson. \"Technology like this could make all the difference, but it's important that the capacity of community therapists is boosted to keep up with demand, as there is already a long wait for help.\"\n\nCambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Dr Alexis Joannides and Prof Topun Austin say the technology could speed up diagnosis and care for babies with brain injury\n\nProf Topun Austin is a consultant neonatologist and director of the Cambridge University Hospital's Evelyn Perinatal Imaging Centre. His research focuses on brain treatments at the extremes of life – young and old. He explains: \"The Fusion study aims to develop and demonstrate a system for the cot-side assessment of brain activity in newborn infants and is currently the first of its kind in the world. \"We have spent 12 months successfully proving the concept with the help of healthy and premature babies and will now focus on babies considered to be at higher risk of brain damage. \"Understanding brain activity patterns in both term and preterm infants can help us identify those most vulnerable to injury at an early stage.\"\n\nMs Georgieva and her partner Thomas Starnes feel it is important for their son to contribute to health research as \"he will benefit from other advances in medicine as he grows up\"\n\nTheo is one of the healthy term babies taking part in the trial, but his mother, Stani Georgieva, feels it is important to contribute. \"His dad and I are both scientists and when Theo grows up he'll be able to take advantage of all of the advancements that have been made through research, so we felt it was important for him to be a little part of that understanding,\" she says. Dr Joannides is also co-director of the NIHR HealthTech Research Centre in Brain Injury, based in Cambridge. It exists to help develop new technologies to improve the lives of people with brain injury. The centre has funded a researcher for the study and will lend its expertise to help roll out the device across the NHS, should the study prove successful. \"We still have hurdles to overcome, but we hope, within three to five years we'll have a product that can be evaluated more widely,\" he says. \"Cost permitting, it could not only monitor babies with a known problem, but also be a screening tool to help identify others who may be at risk.\"\n\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Brain injury in newborn babies can cause serious problems like cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Right now, doctors use MRI or ultrasound scans to check babies’ brains, but these tests can be slow, expensive, and hard to repeat often. \n\n**What happened** – Researchers in Cambridge have created a special ‘swimming cap’ that fits on a baby’s head. It uses light and ultrasound together to watch how the brain is working. The cap is soft, portable, and can be used right next to the baby’s cot. They are testing this new technology with babies, including healthy ones like three-week-old Theo, to see how well it works.\n\n**Impact** – This cap is the first to combine these two types of brain monitoring in a way that is gentle and easy to use. It can be used often because it does not disturb the baby. That means doctors can spot brain problems earlier than before. Early detection means babies can get help sooner, which could improve their development and quality of life.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers will now test the cap on babies who have a higher risk of brain injury. If the trials go well, they hope to start using this technology in hospitals across the UK within the next 3 to 5 years. It might also be used to screen all newborns to find brain problems early.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new portable ‘swimming cap’ using light and ultrasound could help doctors find and treat brain injuries in newborn babies much earlier and more easily than current methods.",

      "summary": "Novo Nordisk’s oral semaglutide 25 mg achieved up to 16.6% weight loss in a landmark study, rivaling injectable Wegovy. The pill also improved cardiovascular risk factors and physical activity levels. With a safety profile consistent with existing treatments, experts see it as a breakthrough for patients preferring oral options.",
      "content": "Novo Nordisk's new oral formulation of semaglutide 25 mg (Wegovy in a pill) produced a 16.6% average weight loss among adults with obesity, according to results from a newly published clinical study. The once-daily pill, developed as an alternative to the injectable version of Wegovy, helped one in three participants lose 20% or more of their body weight.\n\nIn addition to significant weight reduction, those taking oral semaglutide 25 mg experienced improvements in daily physical function, including activities such as bending, walking, standing, and overall mobility, along with better cardiovascular risk profiles. Novo Nordisk has submitted the treatment to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first oral GLP-1 therapy for long-term weight management.2 Production of the medication is already underway at the company's facilities in the United States.\n\nLandmark Study Published in The New England Journal of Medicine\n\nThe OASIS 4 phase 3 trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, marks a major advance in Novo Nordisk's effort to expand obesity treatment options. Conducted over 64 weeks, the study compared once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg plus lifestyle changes with a placebo in 307 adults who were obese or overweight and had at least one weight-related condition, but did not have diabetes.\n\nParticipants who consistently adhered to treatment achieved an average weight loss of 16.6% versus 2.7% for those taking placebo. Over one-third (34.4%) lost at least 20% of their body weight compared with 2.9% in the placebo group. These outcomes were similar to previous results with injectable Wegovy.\n\nWhen measured regardless of treatment adherence, average weight loss was 13.6% for the semaglutide group compared with 2.2% for placebo. In this group, nearly 30% (29.7%) of participants still lost 20% or more of their weight, compared with 3.3% for placebo. The study also confirmed improvements in cardiovascular risk markers and physical activity levels consistent with the injectable version.\n\nExpert Perspectives on Efficacy and Potential Impact\n\n\"The oral semaglutide 25 mg data show compelling efficacy for an oral weight management medication with 16.6% weight loss and a safety and tolerability profile consistent with injectable Wegovy,\" said Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research & Development at Novo Nordisk. \"Currently, less than 2% of individuals with obesity in the US receive obesity medication and Wegovy in a pill may also address patient preference for oral treatment. Pending FDA approval, ample supply will be available to meet the expected US demand as we hope to set a new treatment benchmark for oral weight loss medications for people with overweight or obesity.\"\n\nThe OASIS 4 trial reported that gastrointestinal side effects with the oral medication were generally mild to moderate and temporary. The most common were nausea (46.6% compared with 18.6% for placebo) and vomiting (30.9% compared with 5.9% for placebo). Adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 6.9% of participants on semaglutide and 5.9% of those on placebo. Serious adverse events were less frequent among those taking the medication (3.9%) compared with placebo (8.8%).\n\nThese findings reinforce the established safety and tolerability record of semaglutide, supported by more than 37 million patient-years of use worldwide.\n\nAdvancing Obesity Care Through Innovation\n\n\"The OASIS 4 trial results further underscore the significant impact that semaglutide can have in achieving sustainable weight loss and broader health benefits,\" said Sean Wharton, lead study author and medical director of the Wharton Medical Clinic. \"Oral semaglutide 25 mg builds on the proven efficacy and established safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide and represents a significant advancement in obesity treatment. People with overweight or obesity have individual preferences, and with oral semaglutide as a potential new treatment option, more of those who are not on treatment today may consider starting GLP-1 treatment.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for the once-daily Wegovy® pill to the FDA in February. The review is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.5 Currently, there are no oral GLP-1 therapies approved for weight management. If authorized, the new pill will be manufactured entirely in the United States, where production is already underway at Novo Nordisk's expanded facility.\n\nInside the OASIS 4 Clinical Trial\n\nOASIS 4 was a 64-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg in 307 adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity. People with diabetes were not included.\n\nThe study included a 12-week dose escalation phase, a 52-week treatment period, and a 7-week follow-up after treatment ended. Participants were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either semaglutide or placebo, combined with lifestyle counseling and diet modification for the duration of the trial.\n\nUnderstanding Obesity as a Chronic Condition\n\nObesity is a complex, chronic, and progressive disease that requires long-term management. A common misconception is that it results solely from a lack of willpower, when in reality, biological, genetic, social, and environmental factors all contribute to the difficulty of losing and maintaining weight.\n\nAbout Wegovy and Its Existing Uses\n\nWegovy is the brand name for semaglutide 2.4 mg, which is currently available as an injection. In the European Union, Wegovy is approved as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2) who have at least one weight-related condition. It is also approved for adolescents aged 12 and older with obesity and a body weight above 60 kg.\n\nThe label includes clinical data showing reductions in major cardiovascular events (MACE), improvements in symptoms related to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), enhanced physical function, and less pain associated with knee osteoarthritis.\n\nIn the United States, Wegovy (semaglutide) injection 2.4 mg is approved for adults and children aged 12 and older with obesity, or adults with overweight and a related medical condition, to help reduce excess body weight and maintain weight loss. It is also indicated to lower the risk of major cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, or stroke in adults with obesity or overweight and established heart disease.\n\nSemaglutide injection 2.4 mg carries a Boxed Warning for possible thyroid tumors, including cancer, and should not be used by individuals with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Oral semaglutide 25 mg (Wegovy in a pill) is not yet approved in the US or Europe.",

      "summary": "Researchers have created a bioinspired gel that can regenerate tooth enamel by mimicking natural growth processes. The fluoride-free material forms a mineral-rich layer that restores enamel’s strength and structure while preventing decay. It can even repair exposed dentine and reduce sensitivity. Early testing shows it performs like natural enamel, with potential for rapid clinical use.",
      "content": "Scientists have developed a new material that forms a gel capable of repairing and regenerating tooth enamel, paving the way for more effective and longer-lasting dental care.\n\nResearchers from the University of Nottingham's School of Pharmacy and Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering created a bioinspired compound designed to restore enamel that has been eroded or demineralized. The same material can also reinforce existing enamel and help prevent future decay. Their findings were published on November 4 in Nature Communications.\n\nMimicking Nature to Heal and Strengthen Teeth\n\nThis innovative gel can be quickly applied to teeth in much the same way as standard fluoride treatments. Unlike traditional products, it contains no fluoride. Instead, it is made from proteins that imitate those naturally responsible for guiding enamel formation early in life.\n\nOnce applied, the gel forms a thin yet durable layer that seeps into the surface of the teeth, filling in tiny cracks and holes. It then acts as a scaffold that captures calcium and phosphate ions from saliva. These minerals are carefully organized into new enamel through a process known as epitaxial mineralization. This allows the regenerated enamel to integrate seamlessly with the existing tooth structure, restoring both strength and appearance.\n\nThe material can also be used on exposed dentine, creating an enamel-like coating that helps reduce tooth sensitivity and improves how restorations, such as fillings or veneers, bond to the tooth surface.\n\nEnamel damage plays a major role in tooth decay, which affects nearly half of the global population. When enamel is lost, the teeth become more vulnerable to infections, cavities, and even tooth loss. These issues have also been linked to broader health conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nBecause enamel cannot naturally regenerate once it is lost, dental care has long focused on prevention or temporary protection. Existing treatments like fluoride varnishes and remineralization products can help relieve symptoms but do not actually rebuild enamel.\n\nRestoring the Structure of Natural Enamel\n\nDr. Abshar Hasan, a Postdoctoral Fellow and lead author of the study, explained: \"Dental enamel has a unique structure, which gives enamel its remarkable properties that protect our teeth throughout life against physical, chemical, and thermal insults. When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural healthy enamel. We have tested the mechanical properties of these regenerated tissues under conditions simulating 'real-life situations' such as tooth brushing, chewing, and exposure to acidic foods, and found that the regenerated enamel behaves just like healthy enamel.\"\n\nProfessor Alvaro Mata, Chair in Biomedical Engineering & Biomaterials and lead investigator on the project, emphasized the technology's practical potential: \"We are very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind. It is safe, can be easily and rapidly applied, and it is scalable. Also, the technology is versatile, which opens the opportunity to be translated into multiple types of products to help patients of all ages suffering from a variety of dental problems associated with loss of enamel and exposed dentine. We have started this process with our start-up company Mintech-Bio and hope to have a first product out by next year; this innovation could soon be helping patients worldwide.\"\n\nToward the Future of Self-Healing Teeth\n\nWith its ability to mimic natural enamel formation and strengthen teeth without fluoride, this new gel could redefine modern dentistry. If commercialized successfully, it may offer a simple, safe, and lasting solution for restoring enamel and preventing decay -- helping people maintain stronger, healthier teeth for life.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Tooth enamel is the hard outer layer that protects our teeth. When enamel wears away, teeth become sensitive and more likely to get cavities. Unlike other parts of the body, enamel cannot grow back on its own, so dentists usually focus on preventing damage or using treatments that only protect teeth temporarily.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists at the University of Nottingham created a special gel that can actually rebuild tooth enamel. This gel is made from proteins that copy how enamel naturally forms in the body. When applied to teeth, the gel fills in tiny cracks and helps minerals from saliva form a new enamel layer. It can also cover exposed dentine, the layer under enamel, to reduce sensitivity. Tests show the new enamel is strong and acts like natural enamel.\n\n**Impact** – This gel is different because it does not use fluoride, which is common in many dental products, but instead works by encouraging teeth to heal themselves. It could help many people around the world by repairing enamel damage and preventing tooth decay more effectively than current treatments. Since enamel damage is linked to bigger health problems like heart disease and diabetes, this invention could also improve overall health.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers have started a company called Mintech-Bio to bring this gel to dentists and patients.

Contrairement à d’autres parties du corps, l’émail ne peut pas se régénérer naturellement, donc les dentistes se concentrent sur la prévention ou des traitements temporaires.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des scientifiques de l’Université de Nottingham ont créé un gel spécial qui peut réellement reconstruire l’émail des dents. Ce gel est fait de protéines qui imitent la formation naturelle de l’émail dans le corps. Appliqué sur les dents, il comble les petites fissures et aide les minéraux de la salive à former une nouvelle couche d’émail. Il peut aussi recouvrir la dentine exposée pour réduire la sensibilité. Les tests montrent que ce nouvel émail est solide et fonctionne comme l’émail naturel.\n\n**Impact** – Ce gel est différent car il ne contient pas de fluor, souvent présent dans les produits dentaires, mais favorise la guérison naturelle des dents. Il pourrait aider beaucoup de personnes dans le monde en réparant les dommages à l’émail et en prévenant les caries plus efficacement que les traitements actuels. Comme les problèmes d’émail sont liés à des maladies plus graves comme le diabète et les maladies cardiaques, cette invention pourrait aussi améliorer la santé globale.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs ont lancé une entreprise, Mintech-Bio, pour commercialiser ce gel auprès des dentistes et des patients. Ils espèrent sortir le premier produit l’année prochaine. En cas de succès, ce gel pourrait devenir un traitement dentaire courant, facilitant la réparation des dents et la réduction de la sensibilité.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Un nouveau gel à base de protéines peut reconstruire l’émail dentaire, offrant une méthode prometteuse pour réparer et protéger les dents sans traitements au fluor.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – El esmalte es la capa dura que protege nuestros dientes. Cuando se desgasta, los dientes se vuelven sensibles y más propensos a las caries. A diferencia de otras partes del cuerpo, el esmalte no puede crecer de nuevo por sí solo, por lo que los dentistas se enfocan en prevenir daños o usar tratamientos que solo protegen temporalmente.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Científicos de la Universidad de Nottingham crearon un gel especial que puede reconstruir el esmalte dental. Este gel está hecho de proteínas que imitan cómo se forma el esmalte de manera natural en el cuerpo. Al aplicarlo en los dientes, el gel rellena pequeñas grietas y ayuda a que los minerales de la saliva formen una nueva capa de esmalte. También puede cubrir la dentina expuesta para reducir la sensibilidad. Las pruebas muestran que este nuevo esmalte es fuerte y funciona como el esmalte natural.\n\n**Impacto** – Este gel es diferente porque no usa flúor, común en muchos productos dentales, sino que ayuda a que los dientes se reparen por sí mismos. Podría ayudar a muchas personas en el mundo al reparar daños en el esmalte y prevenir caries de manera más efectiva que los tratamientos actuales. Como el daño al esmalte está relacionado con problemas de salud mayores como enfermedades cardíacas y diabetes, este invento también podría mejorar la salud general.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores han creado una empresa llamada Mintech-Bio para llevar este gel a dentistas y pacientes. Esperan lanzar el primer producto el próximo año. Si tiene éxito, este gel podría convertirse en un tratamiento dental común, facilitando la reparación de dientes y reduciendo la sensibilidad.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Un nuevo gel a base de proteínas puede reconstruir el esmalte dental, ofreciendo una forma prometedora de reparar y proteger los dientes sin tratamientos con flúor.",

      "title": "Mini llama proteins show promise for Alzheimer’s treatment",
      "summary": "Miniature antibodies from camels and llamas can slip into the brain more easily than conventional drugs, offering a new way to treat disorders like Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia. Researchers say these “nanobodies” could reshape the future of brain medicine.",
      "content": "Nanobodies, which are very small proteins found in camelid species such as camels, llamas, and alpacas, may provide a powerful new way to treat brain disorders like schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. A new study published on November 5 in the Cell Press journal Trends in Pharmacological Sciences explains how their small size allows them to reach and treat brain cells more effectively in mice, while causing fewer side effects. The researchers also outline what must be done before these treatments can be safely tested in humans.\n\n\"Camelid nanobodies open a new era of biologic therapies for brain disorders and revolutionize our thinking about therapeutics,\" says co-corresponding author Philippe Rondard of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Montpellier, France. \"We believe they can form a new class of drugs between conventional antibodies and small molecules.\"\n\nHow Nanobodies Were Discovered\n\nNanobodies were first identified in the early 1990s by Belgian scientists investigating the immune systems of camelids. They found that, in addition to the standard antibodies composed of two heavy and two light chains, camelids also produce a simpler version made up of only heavy chains. The small, active fragment of these antibodies -- now known as nanobodies -- is about one-tenth the size of typical antibodies. These unique molecules have not been observed in any other mammals, although they do exist in some cartilaginous fish.\n\nAntibody-based drugs are widely used to treat conditions like cancer and autoimmune diseases, but they have shown limited success in addressing disorders of the brain. Even the few antibody therapies that provide some benefit, such as certain Alzheimer's treatments, are often linked to unwanted side effects.\n\nAccording to the researchers, nanobodies' compact structure gives them a distinct advantage. Their smaller size allows them to cross the blood-brain barrier and act on targets more efficiently, which could lead to improved outcomes with fewer adverse reactions. In previous studies, nanobodies have been shown to restore normal behavior in mouse models of schizophrenia and other neurological disorders.\n\nHow Nanobodies Work in the Brain\n\n\"These are highly soluble small proteins that can enter the brain passively,\" explains co-corresponding author Pierre-André Lafon, also of CNRS. \"By contrast, small-molecule drugs that are designed to cross the blood-brain barrier are hydrophobic in nature, which limits their bioavailability, increases the risk of off-target binding, and is linked to side effects.\"\n\nBeyond their unique biological properties, nanobodies are simpler to produce and purify than traditional antibodies. They can also be precisely engineered and fine-tuned to target specific molecules in the brain.\n\nBefore nanobody-based drugs can be tested in human clinical trials, several key steps must be completed. The research team notes that toxicology studies and long-term safety assessments are essential. They also need to understand the effects of chronic administration and determine how long nanobodies remain active in the brain (a crucial step for developing accurate dosing strategies).\n\n\"Regarding the nanobodies themselves, it is also necessary to evaluate their stability, confirm their proper folding, and ensure the absence of aggregation,\" says Rondard. \"It will be necessary to obtain clinical-grade nanobodies and stable formulations that maintain activity during long-term storage and transport.\"\n\nMoving Toward Clinical Applications\n\n\"Our lab has already started to study these different parameters for a few brain-penetrant nanobodies and has recently shown that conditions of treatment are compatible with chronic treatment,\" Lafon adds.\n\nThis research was supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), University of Montpellier, French National Research Agency (ANR-20-CE18-0011; ANR-22-CE18-0003; ANR-25-CE18-0434), Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale (FRM EQU202303016470 and FRM PMT202407019488), LabEX MAbImprove (ANR-10-LABX-5301), Proof-of-concept Région Occitanie, and the transfer of Technology Agency SaTT AxLR Occitanie.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long struggled to find effective medicines for brain diseases like Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia. One big challenge is that many drugs cannot easily enter the brain because of a protective barrier called the blood-brain barrier.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers have discovered that tiny proteins called nanobodies, which come from animals like llamas and camels, can cross this barrier more easily than regular drugs. A new study published on November 5 shows that these nanobodies can reach brain cells in mice and help treat brain disorders with fewer side effects.\n\n**Impact** – Nanobodies are much smaller than regular antibodies, making them better at reaching and fixing problems inside the brain. Unlike some current treatments that can cause unwanted effects, nanobodies work more precisely and safely. This discovery could change how we treat diseases like Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia, which affect millions of people worldwide.\n\n**What’s next step** – Before testing in humans, scientists need to make sure nanobodies are safe for long-term use. This includes checking if they stay stable over time, don’t clump together, and don’t cause harm when used repeatedly. The research team is already working on these important safety studies.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Tiny proteins from llamas and camels called nanobodies may soon offer safer and more effective treatments for brain diseases like Alzheimer’s by crossing the brain’s protective barrier more easily than current drugs.",
