      "title": "We are living in a golden age of species discovery",
      "summary": "The search for life on Earth is speeding up, not slowing down. Scientists are now identifying more than 16,000 new species each year, revealing far more biodiversity than expected across animals, plants, fungi, and beyond. Many species remain undiscovered, especially insects and microbes, and future advances could unlock millions more. Each new find also opens doors to conservation and medical breakthroughs.",
      "content": "Roughly three centuries ago, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus set out to catalog and name every living organism he could find. He is now widely regarded as the founder of modern taxonomy after introducing the binomial naming system and formally describing more than 10,000 species of plants and animals. Scientists have continued that mission ever since, steadily expanding humanity's understanding of Earth's biodiversity.\n\nA new study led by researchers at the University of Arizona and published in Science Advances shows that the pace of discovery is accelerating. Today, scientists are identifying more than 16,000 new species each year, the highest rate ever recorded. The researchers say this trend is not slowing and suggest that groups such as plants, fungi, arachnids, fishes and amphibians are far more diverse than previously believed.\n\n\"Some scientists have suggested that the pace of new species descriptions has slowed down and that this indicates that we are running out of new species to discover, but our results show the opposite,\" said John Wiens, a professor in the University of Arizona Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, in the College of Science, and senior author of the paper. \"In fact, we're finding new species at a faster rate than ever before.\"\n\nWhat the Data Reveal About Global Biodiversity\n\nTo reach their conclusions, the team examined the taxonomic records of roughly 2 million species from across all major forms of life. Looking at the most recent period with comprehensive data, between 2015 and 2020, they found that researchers documented an average of more than 16,000 new species per year. These discoveries included more than 10,000 animals (dominated by arthropods and insects), about 2,500 plants, and roughly 2,000 fungi.\n\n\"Our good news is that this rate of new species discovery far outpaces the rate of species extinctions, which we calculated to about 10 per year,\" said Wiens, referring to another study he led that was published in October. \"These thousands of newly found species each year are not just microscopic organisms, but include insects, plants, fungi and even hundreds of new vertebrates.\"\n\nMore Species Than Ever and Many Still Undiscovered\n\nWiens and his co-authors found that scientists are describing more species annually than at any other time in history. They also used long-term trends in discovery rates to estimate how many species may exist overall. Their projections suggest there could be as many as 115,000 fish species and 41,000 amphibian species, compared with about 42,000 fish and 9,000 amphibians currently described. The researchers also estimate that the total number of plant species could exceed half a million.\n\n\"As the famous ecologist Robert May said, if visiting aliens asked us how many species live on our planet, we would have no definitive answer,\" said Wiens. \"Right now, we know of about 2.5 million species, but the true number may be in the tens or hundreds of millions or even the low billions.\"\n\nThe team expects the discovery rate to keep rising. For instance, scientists have formally identified around 1.1 million insect species, but many researchers estimate the real number is closer to 6 million. In earlier work, Wiens suggested the total could even approach 20 million.\n\n\"Right now, most new species are identified by visible traits,\" said Wiens. He explained that advances in molecular techniques are making it possible to detect species that look similar on the surface but differ genetically. This approach is especially promising for uncovering previously unrecognized bacteria and fungi.\n\nWhy Discovering New Species Matters\n\n\"Discovering new species is important because these species can't be protected until they're scientifically described,\" Wiens added. \"Documentation is the first step in conservation -- we can't safeguard a species from extinction if we don't know it exists.\"\n\nNew discoveries also play a role in improving human health and technology. Many natural products come from living organisms, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, popular weight-loss drugs inspired by a hormone found in Gila monsters. Compounds from spider and snake venoms, along with substances produced by plants and fungi, are being studied for their potential to treat pain, cancer, and other conditions.\n\nBeyond medicine, nature often inspires innovation. Some species have physical traits that serve as models for new materials and technologies, such as surfaces designed to mimic the \"super-clinging\" feet that allow geckos to scale vertical walls.\n\n\"We're still just scratching the surface of what these species can do for humanity,\" Wiens said.\n\nMapping the Future of Discovery\n\nLooking ahead, the researchers plan to chart where new species are most frequently found to pinpoint regions rich in undiscovered life. They are also examining who is making these discoveries to see whether the field has shifted from being dominated by European scientists to researchers documenting species in their own home countries.\n\n\"Even though Linnaeus' quest to identify species began 300 years ago, 15% of all known species have been discovered in just the past 20 years,\" Wiens said. \"So much remains unknown, and each new discovery brings us closer to understanding and protecting the incredible biodiversity of life on our planet.\"",

Researchers found that most people, especially in wealthy countries, are exceeding a “food emissions budget” needed to keep global warming below 2°C.

      "content": "What did you find?\n\neople, the holidays often bring joyful indulgence, followed by regret and ambitious New Year’s resolutions to eat better.\n\nA recent study from the University of British Columbia suggests moderation should not be a seasonal goal but a long-term one. The research found that 44 percent of the global population would need to change their eating habits to keep global warming below 2 °C.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. Juan Diego Martinez while he was a doctoral student at UBC’s Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability. He explains what the research uncovered and outlines practical diet changes that could make a real difference.\n\nWhat did you find?\n\nHalf of us globally and at least 90 percent of Canadians need to change our diets to prevent severe planetary warming. And that number is conservative, because we used 2012 data. Since then, emissions and the world's population have both increased. Looking ahead to 2050, we found that 90 percent of us will need to be eating differently.\n\nWe looked at data from 112 countries, accounting for 99 percent of food-related greenhouse gas emissions globally, and divided each country's population into 10 income groups. We calculated a food emissions budget for each person by combining emissions from food consumption, global food production and supply chains, and compared these emissions to the total the world can afford if we want to stay below 2 °C of warming.\n\nWhy focus on dietary changes rather than, say, flying less?\n\nThe world's food systems are responsible for more than one-third of all human greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe found that the 15 percent of people who emitted the most account for 30 percent of total food emissions, equaling the contribution of the entire bottom 50 percent. This select group consists of the wealthiest people in high emissions countries, including the Central African Republic, Brazil and Australia.\n\nEven though this group is emitting a lot, there is a much higher number of people whose diets are above that cap. This is why half, not just the richest, of the global population needs to change diets. In Canada, all 10 income groups are above the cap.\n\nDebates around flying less, driving electric and buying fewer luxury goods are valid: We need to reduce emissions any way we can. However, food emissions are not just a problem for the richest -- we all need to eat, so we can all make a change. For people who are both flying frequently and eating lots of beef, it's not an either/or: Try to reduce both.\n\nWhat changes can we make to our diets?\n\nEat only what you need. Repurpose what you don't. Less wasted food means fewer emissions, less cooking and more easy, tasty leftovers.\n\nEliminate or reduce your beef consumption -- 43 percent of food-related emissions from the average Canadian come from beef alone. We could have had our beef and eaten it too if we'd followed the agreements laid out in the Kyoto Protocol, but we're now at a point where food emissions also need to fall to avoid the worst of climate change.\n\nI grew up in Latin America where eating a lot of beef is part of the culture, so I get how much of an ask this is. But we just can't deny the data anymore.\n\nVote with your fork. This is a first step to demand change from your political leaders. The more we talk about our own dietary changes and what matters to us, the more politicians will begin to care about policies that bring positive changes to our food systems.",

Introducing Sustainability In Your Ear transcripts\n\nSolar and wind have become the cheapest sources of power in human history, but political headwinds threaten to derail the fastest energy transformation ever recorded. At this crucial juncture, how do we ensure America doesn’t surrender its technological leadership in clean energy to nations more willing to embrace the future? Meet Bill McKibben, legendary environmentalist and author whose four decades of climate writing have shaped our understanding of the environmental crisis. His latest book, Here Comes the Sun, argues that we’re standing at the hinge of history. In 2024, 92% of new global electricity generation came from renewables, and the U.S. saw greater gains, at 96% of new generation capacity. McKibben, founder of 350.org and Third Act, believes we can fundamentally reshape how civilization powers itself if we look forward to energy abundance rather than backward to fossil fuel scarcity.\n\nThe numbers are stunning, but the transition isn’t guaranteed. McKibben warns that while the adoption of renewable energy is inevitable due to economic forces, it may not occur quickly enough to prevent catastrophic climate change. That’s why he’s organizing Sun Day, a national day of action on September 21st, designed to drive renewables out of the “alternative” category once and for all. Once solar panels are installed, McKibben explains, “the sun pleasantly delivers the energy for free over and over and over and over again.” That’s a paradigm shift from buying energy as a commodity that could reshape not just our power grid, but geopolitics itself. While partisan politics may divide Americans on climate change, polling shows both conservatives and liberals support solar power—albeit for different reasons. His conservative neighbors embrace energy independence and self-reliance, while liberals appreciate the environmental benefits. “Even humans are going to be hard pressed to figure out how to start a war over sunshine,” McKibben notes.\n\nYou can learn more about Bill McKibben’s work at BillMcKibben.com and Sun Day events at Sunday.Earth. “Here Comes the Sun” is available on Amazon, at Powell’s Books, and in local bookstores.\n\nSubscribe to Sustainability In Your Ear on iTunes\n\nFollow Sustainability In Your Ear on Spreaker, iHeartRadio, or YouTube\n\nEditor’s Note: This episode originally aired on September 8, 2025.",

Her weapon: film.\n\nThe humid air of the Amazon hangs heavy as dusk settles over the sprawling city of Belem, Brazil, during the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), a world away from the familiar heat of her native Kenya.\n\nYet for Emily Wanja Nderitu, the setting feels familiar in another way: it is a frontline in the global climate struggle, a place where local stories must be told if justice is to be achieved.\n\nNderitu, who works with Doc Society, a global organization supporting independent storytellers, believes that Africa’s climate narrative must be reclaimed from the margins.\n\n“COP is an event. Climate is not an event,” she said with the calm assurance of someone who has spent years watching headlines fade faster than droughts end.\n\nIn the crowded halls of the conference center where global climate diplomacy is brokered, promises are often made, and just as often broken.\n\nChanging how the world talks about the planet’s crisis\n\nFor nearly a decade, Nderitu has been trying to change how the world talks about the planet’s crisis and examining who gets to tell that story.\n\nAs an impact producer at Doc Society, she works behind the scenes, connecting filmmakers, activists, and cultural institutions across Africa to help them build stories that don’t just stir emotion but move policy, shift power, and stay in communities long after the cameras leave.\n\nHer work revolves around two initiatives: the Democracy Story Unit and the Climate Story Labs — both designed to fuse art, science, and politics. She explained:\n\nWe bring together storytellers, scientists, and policymakers to ask: what are the stories we need right now, in this place? And how do we make sure those stories live beyond the screen — that they create real impact?\n\nIt’s an unconventional approach in a world that often treats climate communication as a technical affair. But Nderitu’s lens is deeply human and unapologetically African.\n\nShe first stepped into the field in 2016 as the impact producer for Thank You for the Rain, an award-winning documentary following Kenyan farmer Kisilu Musya as he transformed from a struggling grower into a climate campaigner. She recalled:\n\nThat film changed me. It made me realise storytelling could be the missing piece… the bridge between lived experience and global policy.\n\nSince then, she’s worked with filmmakers across the continent to spotlight what she calls the wisdom in the everyday.\n\nIn Africa, we don’t always say ‘climate change.’ We talk about delayed rains, the cows, and the crops. Climate is part of our daily conversation… part of who we are.\n\nAfrica’s secret weapon in the climate fight\n\nThat intimacy with the land, she says, is Africa’s secret weapon in the climate fight — but one the world rarely listens to. She said:\n\nNature is not out there; it’s intertwined with how we live, how we farm, how we pray. Our rituals, our seasons, our songs — they all tell you how deeply connected we are.\n\nFor Nderitu, the task isn’t to romanticize ancestral knowledge, but to modernise how it’s valued.\n\nWe have generations of wisdom on how to adapt — on when to plant, how to share water, how to rebuild after loss. But when global platforms talk about ‘solutions,’ they often ignore that. They speak science; we speak survival.\n\nShe believes African voices must shape the climate narrative not just as witnesses but as strategists. She explained:\n\nWe need to tell our stories in our own way — through our realities, our languages, our humour, even our pain. And then we need to show the world what our vision for the future actually looks like.\n\nThat conviction drives the Climate Story Labs she helps run across the continent. Part creative incubator, part movement-building experiment, the labs bring together everyone from scientists to poets to local chiefs. “We treat stories as living organisms,” Nderitu explained.\n\nImpact doesn’t have to trend. It just has to work\n\nShe recounts moments where storytelling has already led to change. A film screening on land rights in Kenya sparked a town hall that pushed local leaders to revise an outdated water policy. In South Africa, a community photo project on drought inspired a new school garden programme. None of these made international news, but they mattered.\n\n“Impact doesn’t have to trend,” she said. “It just has to work.”\n\nThat quiet philosophy sets her apart from the noise that surrounds global climate conversations, especially the performative chaos of COP meetings.\n\nI respect the ambition, but if all we do is talk here, we’re missing the point. The real work begins after COP — in the fields, in the films, in the small rooms where people decide what to do next.\n\nFor all its pledges, the world’s premier climate summit has yet to match the urgency felt in places like Machakos, Kilifi, or Karamoja, where the line between survival and loss is drawn by the next rainfall.\n\nStill, Nderitu remains optimistic — and her optimism is infectious. She affirmed:\n\nWe’re not short of knowledge or courage in Africa. We’re short of recognition. Storytelling can fix that. It can close the gap between visibility and value.\n\nAs COP30 unfolds, she and her colleagues are pushing for a new kind of climate diplomacy — one that begins not with targets but with truth. They envision a world where local stories shape global priorities, where a grandmother’s memory of past droughts is treated with the same respect as a scientist’s model of the future.\n\n“If you want to change how people act, change what they believe,” she said. “And belief begins with story.”\n\nIn a conference dominated by numbers, Nderitu’s weapon of choice — empathy — feels almost radical. But in her world, it’s also the most pragmatic tool available. Stories, she insists, can make people care. And people who care, act.",
