NASA\n\nNASA and its partners have supported humans continuously living and working in space since November 2000. A truly global endeavor, the International Space Station has been visited by more than 290 people from 26 countries and a variety of international and commercial spacecraft. The unique microgravity laboratory has hosted more than 4,000 experiments from over 5,000 researchers from 110 countries. The space station also is facilitating the growth of a commercial market in low Earth orbit for research, technology development, and crew and cargo transportation.\n\nAfter a quarter of century of human presence in orbit, the station remains a symbol of international cooperation and a proving ground for humanity’s next giant leaps to the Moon and, eventually, Mars.\n\nSeptember’s full Moon, the Harvest Moon, is photographed from the space station, placed in between exterior station hardware. NASA\n\nThe microgravity environments aboard the space station unlocks discoveries that benefit life on Earth and prepare humans for deep space missions. NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP) works to understand the changes astronauts face aboard the orbital outpost and to develop interventions to keep crews healthy before, during, and after flight.\n\nAstronauts aboard the station exercise for roughly two hours a day to protect bone density, muscle strength, and the cardiovascular system, but the longer they are in microgravity, the harder it can be for the brain and body to readapt to gravity’s pull. After months in orbit, returning astronauts often describe Earth as heavy, loud, and strangely still. Some reacclimate within days, while other astronauts take longer to fully recover.\n\nThrough HRP-led studies, scientists track these changes and test solutions—from improved exercise regimens to medical monitoring and nutritional strategies. The results inspire new medical technologies, while teaching scientists how the human body adapts to long-duration spaceflights—knowledge that helps keep astronauts healthy on future missions.\n\nIn the Tranquility node of the orbiting laboratory, NASA astronaut Jessica Meir exercises on the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (COLBERT), technically named the Treadmill 2 and abbreviated as T2. NASA\n\nThe space station continues to be a critical platform for sharpening skills, technology, and understanding that will prepare humanity to return to the Moon with NASA’s Artemis campaign and journey on to Mars and beyond.\n\nSince space presents an entirely new physical environment with a distinct set of challenges, the orbiting laboratory is uniquely positioned to support research and preparations not possible on Earth. That includes:\n\nMastering techniques for basic tasks like drinking water, sleeping, exercising, and handling various materials.\n\nDeveloping solutions to microgravity-induced changes to and challenges for the human body.\n\nTesting reliable technologies and self-sustaining ecosystems necessary for deep space travel, from life support systems to in-orbit agriculture and 3D printing of materials.\n\nRefining techniques and procedures for data and imagery collection and analysis.\n\nRead more about how the space station has enabled significant strides in our journey farther into the final frontier.\n\nThe first decade of the space station was the decade of construction. The second decade moved from initial studies to fully using the orbiting laboratory. Now we are in the decade of results.\n\nWith nearly 25 years of experiments conducted aboard the station, more breakthroughs are materializing than ever before. These scientific discoveries and technological advancements are benefiting humanity on the ground, contributing to the growing low Earth orbit economy, and helping to prepare for future exploration of the Moon and Mars.\n\nInnovations include:\n\nAdvances in X-ray technologies, developed to create a space station telescope, are helping unravel the mysteries of our universe while improving medical devices on Earth.\n\nTemperature-change data that has been employed in efforts to reduce heat absorbed by city surfaces, reduce fire risk, and help farmers efficiently water their fields.\n\nDemonstrations of robotic technologies with the potential to relieve repetitive movement and other workplace-related stressors.\n\nDevelopment of a small ultrasound unit for crew health monitoring that has since been adapted to provide diagnostic care in remote areas on Earth.\n\nFind more information about the space station’s benefits for humanity here.",

      "title": "What looked like a planet was actually a massive space collision",
      "summary": "Around the bright star Fomalhaut, astronomers spotted glowing clouds of debris left behind by colossal collisions between large space rocks. One of these clouds was even mistaken for a planet before slowly fading away. Seeing two such events in just two decades hints that violent impacts may be surprisingly common in young star systems. It’s like watching planets-in-the-making collide before our eyes.",
      "content": "Young star systems are chaotic environments where space rocks constantly collide. Asteroids, comets, and larger bodies crash into one another, sometimes sticking together and slowly transforming clouds of dust and ice into planets and moons. Although small impacts are common, the largest collisions are thought to be extremely rare during the hundreds of millions of years it takes for a planetary system to fully form -- possibly occurring only once every 100,000 years.\n\nYet astronomers have now identified evidence of two enormous collisions around a nearby star named Fomalhaut, all within just 20 years. The finding suggests either an extraordinary stroke of luck or that massive impacts may happen more often during planet formation than scientists previously believed.\n\nThe two events -- first seen in 2004 and again in 2023 -- represent the first time astronomers have directly imaged collisions between large objects in a planetary system beyond our own.\n\nCatching the Aftermath of a Cosmic Impact\n\n\"We just witnessed the collision of two planetesimals and the dust cloud that gets spewed out of that violent event, which begins reflecting light from the host star,\" said Paul Kalas, an adjunct professor of astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of the study. \"We do not directly see the two objects that crashed into each other, but we can spot the aftermath of this enormous impact.\"\n\nOver tens of thousands of years, Kalas explained, the region around Fomalhaut would appear to be filled with glowing debris, \"sparkling with these collisions\" -- similar to twinkling holiday lights.\n\nA Young Star That Mirrors the Early Solar System\n\nKalas began studying Fomalhaut in 1993 while searching for dusty disks that remain after planet formation. Located just 25 light years from Earth, Fomalhaut is relatively young -- about 440 million years old -- making it a useful stand-in for what the solar system looked like early in its history.\n\nUsing NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Kalas eventually detected a broad disk of debris around the star. In 2008, he also reported spotting a bright object near the disk that appeared to be a planet. This marked the first time an exoplanet had been directly imaged at optical wavelengths, and it was named Fomalhaut b following standard naming rules.\n\nThat apparent planet has since vanished. Researchers now believe the object was not a planet at all, but a cloud of dust created when two large bodies collided.\n\nWhen Dust Clouds Look Like Planets\n\n\"This is a new phenomenon, a point source that appears in a planetary system and then over 10 years or more slowly disappears,\" Kalas said. \"It's masquerading as a planet because planets also look like tiny dots orbiting nearby stars.\"\n\nBased on how bright the 2004 and 2023 events appeared, scientists estimate that the colliding bodies were at least 60 kilometers (37 miles) wide. That is more than four times the size of the asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago and led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Objects of this scale are known as planetesimals, similar in size to many asteroids and comets in our solar system, but far smaller than dwarf planets such as Pluto.\n\n\"Fomalhaut is much younger than the solar system, but when our solar system was 440 million years old, it was littered with planetesimals crashing into each other,\" Kalas said. \"That's the time period that we are seeing, when small worlds are being cratered with these violent collisions or even being destroyed and reassembled into different objects. It's like looking back in time in a sense, to that violent period of our solar system when it was less than a billion years old.\"\n\nThe new findings were described in a paper scheduled to be published online Dec. 18 in the journal Science.\n\nA Natural Laboratory for Studying Planet Formation\n\n\"The Fomalhaut system is a natural laboratory to probe how planetesimals behave when undergoing collisions, which in turn tells us about what they are made of and how they formed,\" said Mark Wyatt, a co-author of the study and a professor of astronomy at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. \"The exciting aspect of this observation is that it allows us to estimate both the size of the colliding bodies and how many of them there are in the disk, information which it is almost impossible to get by any other means.\"\n\nWyatt estimates that roughly 300 million planetesimals of similar size orbit Fomalhaut. Earlier observations also detected carbon monoxide gas around the star, indicating that these objects are rich in volatile materials and closely resemble the icy comets found in our own solar system.\n\nDust Clouds Masquerading as Exoplanets\n\nFomalhaut lies in the southern constellation Piscis Austrinus and shines with 16 times the luminosity of our sun, making it one of the brightest stars visible from Earth. When Kalas began observing the star with HST in 2004, he discovered a wide ring of debris located 133 astronomical units (AU) from the star. This is more than three times the distance of the Kuiper Belt from the sun in our solar system. An AU is the average distance between the Earth and the sun, or 93 million miles.\n\nThe sharply defined inner edge of the debris belt suggested that unseen planets might be shaping it. After another HST observation in 2006, Kalas concluded that a bright object visible in images from both 2004 and 2006 was a planet. He acknowledged at the time that it could be a dust cloud created by a collision, but considered that explanation unlikely.\n\nFollow-up HST observations in 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014 changed that view. In the final image, the object known as Fomalhaut b had completely disappeared.\n\nA Second Collision Confirms the Explanation\n\nNine years later, after several unsuccessful attempts to re-image the system, Kalas obtained a new HST image showing another bright point near the earlier location. This source became known as Fomalhaut cs1, short for circumstellar source 1. A second new object, called Fomalhaut cs2, appeared nearby, but its position ruled out the possibility that it was the same object reappearing. Because there was a nine-year gap between the 2014 and 2023 images, astronomers cannot say exactly when cs2 first formed.\n\nIn their new analysis, Kalas and his international team examined the 2023 image along with a lower-quality follow-up image taken in 2024. They concluded that the light could only be explained as sunlight reflecting off a cloud of dust created by a collision between two planetesimals.\n\nKalas noted that while cs1 initially moved in a way consistent with an orbiting planet, its trajectory later curved outward. That behavior matches what would be expected from tiny dust particles being pushed away by the pressure of starlight. The appearance of cs2 strengthens the conclusion that both objects were dust clouds, not planets.\n\nLessons for Future Exoplanet Missions\n\nKalas compared the Fomalhaut debris cloud to the plume of material produced in 2022 when NASA's DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission intentionally crashed into the moonlet Dimorphos, which orbits the asteroid Didemos. The cloud around Fomalhaut, however, is estimated to be about a billion times larger.\n\nOver the next three years, Kalas has been granted observing time with both the James Webb Space Telescope's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the HST. The goal is to monitor how the dust cloud changes over time, including whether it expands and how it moves through the system. The cloud is already about 30% brighter than Fomalhaut cs1, and observations in August 2025 confirmed that cs2 remains visible.\n\nLooking ahead, Kalas urged caution as astronomers prepare for future missions aimed at directly imaging exoplanets.\n\n\"These collisions that produce dust clouds happen in every planetary system,\" he said. \"Once we start probing stars with sensitive future telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, which aims to directly image an Earth-like exoplanet, we have to be cautious because these faint points of light orbiting a star may not be planets.\"\n\nOther co-authors include UC Berkeley research astronomer Thomas Esposito; former UC Berkeley graduate students Jason Wang, now at Northwestern University in Illinois, and Michael Fitzgerald, now at UCLA; former UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow Robert De Rosa, now at the European Southern Observatory in Chile; Maxwell Millar-Blanchaer of UC Santa Barbara; Bin Ren of Xiamen University in China; Maximilian Sommer of the University of Cambridge; and Grant Kennedy of the University of Warwick in the UK.

      "content": "Transit observations and analysis\n\nWe analysed a heterogeneous dataset of light curves from space- and ground-based telescopes (Supplementary Table 1) to measure transit times for the ultimate purpose of modelling TTVs. We used PyMC344, exoplanet (https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/stable/)45 and starry46 to fit the light curve, incorporating tailored models for correlated noise and instrumental systematics appropriate for each dataset.\n\nOur analysis of the K2 and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves involved two distinct approaches with different noise models. For the joint analysis of all transits in both light curves (described below), we modelled stellar variability as a Gaussian process47. By contrast, for measuring individual transit times (see below), a third-order basis spline was sufficient to model the local correlated noise.\n\nTo account for systematics in the Spitzer data, we used pixel-level decorrelation (PLD)48, which uses a linear model with a design matrix formed by the PLD basis vectors (see below for more details). For the ground-based datasets, we included a linear model with a design matrix formed by airmass, pixel centroids, and the pixel response function peak and width covariates, when available.\n\nThe limb-darkening coefficients were calculated using stellar parameters from ref. 2 by interpolation of the parameters tabulated by refs. 49,50. These were fixed for individual transit fits but sampled with uninformative priors in the joint K2 and TESS analysis described below.\n\nWe used Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno optimization51 as implemented in scipy.optimize for initial parameter estimates, followed by posterior sampling with the No-U-Turn Sampler52, an efficient gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler implemented in PyMC3. The chains were well mixed (Gelman–Rubin statistic less than about 1.01) with negligible sampling error.\n\nWe first performed a joint fit of K2 and TESS data assuming a linear ephemeris (see below). We then measured all individual transit times uniformly using Gaussian priors from the joint fit for R p /R ⋆ , b (the transit impact parameter), and T 14 (the total transit duration), and uniform priors for T c (the transit centre time) centred on predicted times. We verified that T c posteriors were Gaussian and isolated well from prior edges.\n\nIn all individual transit fits, we assumed Gaussian independent and identically distributed noise and included a jitter parameter σ jit to account for underestimated photometric uncertainties. The log-likelihood was, thus,\n\n$$\\text{ln}{\\mathcal{L}}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ln}| \\varSigma | -\\frac{1}{2}{{\\bf{r}}}^{{\\rm{T}}}{\\varSigma }^{-1}{\\bf{r}}+{\\rm{const.}},$$\n\nwhere Σ is the diagonal covariance matrix with entries equal to the total variance (that is, the ith entry is \\({\\sigma }_{{\\rm{tot,}}i}^{2}={\\sigma }_{{\\rm{obs,}}i}^{2}+{\\sigma }_{{\\rm{jit}}}^{2}\\), where σ obs,i is the observational uncertainty of the ith data point), and r is the residual vector (\\({\\bf{r}}=[{\\widehat{y}}_{1}-{y}_{1},{\\widehat{y}}_{2}-{y}_{2},\\ldots ,{\\widehat{y}}_{n}-{y}_{n}]\\), where \\(\\widehat{y}\\) is the model and y is the data consisting of n measurements). When a given transit event was observed by several telescopes (for example, at Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO))53, or several band-passes from the same instrument (for example, from MuSCAT3)54, we jointly fitted all light curves covering the same event.\n\nWe obtained ground-based follow-up transit observations from a variety of facilities spanning several observing seasons. Early in the project, observations were distributed diversely among a half-dozen telescopes, but later we focused almost exclusively on the LCO telescope network, which enabled both the acquisition of data and its analysis to be conducted more uniformly. The individual dates, facilities, band-passes and exposure times of these observations are listed in chronological order in Supplementary Table 1. The measured transit times are provided in Supplementary Table 2.\n\nJoint analysis of the K2 and TESS light curves\n\nV1298 Tau (EPIC 210818897) was observed between 7 February and 23 April 2015 during campaign 4 of the K2 mission9. We analysed the K2 light curve produced by the EVEREST pipeline (https://github.com/rodluger/everest)55,56, which is available at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) (https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/everest).\n\nV1298 Tau (TIC 15756231) was observed at 2-min cadence in Sectors 43 and 44 (16 September to 6 November 2021) of the TESS mission57 as part of the Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) programme 036 (PI T. David).\n\nWe conducted a joint fit to the K2 and TESS light curves assuming a linear ephemeris, using a Gaussian process to account for correlated noise arising from a combination of stellar variability and instrumental systematics (based on the tutorial available at https://gallery.exoplanet.codes/tutorials/lc-multi/). We used a simple-harmonic-oscillator covariance function with a power spectral density given by:\n\n$$S(\\omega )=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{{\\rm{\\pi }}}}\\frac{{S}_{0}{\\omega }_{0}^{4}}{{({\\omega }^{2}-{\\omega }_{0}^{2})}^{2}+{\\omega }_{0}^{2}{\\omega }^{2}/{Q}^{2}},$$\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency, ω 0 is the undamped angular frequency of the oscillator and S 0 is a scale factor that sets the amplitude of the variability. This was re-parameterized by the undamped period of the oscillator ρ (defined as ρ = 2π/ω 0 ), the standard deviation of the process σ (defined as \\(\\sigma =\\sqrt{{S}_{0}{\\omega }_{0}Q}\\)) and the quality factor Q (fixed to 1/3). Like our model for individual transits, we included a photometric jitter term (σ jit ), the square of which was added to the diagonal of the covariance matrix. The likelihood was, thus, identical to that shown for individual transits above, but the covariance matrix contained non-zero off-diagonal elements determined by the covariance function. The results of this fit are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2 and the posteriors are summarized in Extended Data Table 1.\n\nIndividual K2 and TESS transits\n\nTo create a uniform transit-timing dataset, we analysed individual transits from the long-baseline K2 and TESS light curves in the same manner as our short-duration follow-up observations. We constructed individual datasets from windows of three times the transit duration centred on each transit event. When there were overlapping transits, we used the longest transit duration and centred the window on the approximate midpoint of the dimming event. Unlike follow-up datasets, which are often partial transits, stellar variability is typically nonlinear on the timescale of these datasets. To account for this, we included a third-order basis spline with five evenly spaced knots. The transits of V1298 Tau c on 10 and 26 October 2021 ut resulted in poor-quality fits, probably due to the presence of short-timescale red noise close to ingress or egress or a low signal-to-noise ratio; as the timing posteriors from these fits were highly non-Gaussian, we discarded them from subsequent analyses.\n\nSpitzer\n\nWe used the ephemeris derived from the K2 observations2 to predict transits of V1298 Tau b within Spitzer visibility windows in 2019. Subsequently, we did the same for V1298 Tau c,d using the ephemerides from ref. 3. Another transit of V1298 Tau b was scheduled in early 2020 using an updated ephemeris based on ref. 2 and the first Spitzer observation of that planet. The Spitzer data and best-fitting transit models are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3.\n\nThe first epoch of Spitzer observations of V1298 Tau were acquired as part of the DDT programme 14227 (PI E. Mamajek) and executed on 1 June 2019 ut. The second epoch of Spitzer observations were acquired as part of the target of opportunity programme 14011 (PI E. Newton) and executed on 28 December 2019 ut. In both epochs, data were acquired with channel 2 of the infrared array camera (IRAC) onboard Spitzer (with effective wavelength λ eff = 4.5 μm) in the subarray mode using 2-s exposures. A third epoch of Spitzer observations were acquired in IRAC channel 1 (λ eff = 3.6 μm) as part of DDT 14276 (PI K. Todorov) and executed on 4 January 2020 ut.\n\nWe extracted photometry following ref. 58 and modelled the instrumental systematics using PLD, which combines normalized pixel light curves as basis vectors in a linear model:\n\n$${M}_{{\\rm{PLD}}}^{t}({\\boldsymbol{\\alpha }})=\\frac{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{9}{c}_{i}{P}_{i}^{t}}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{9}{P}_{i}^{t}},$$\n\nwhere P i is the ith pixel light curve, the superscript t denotes the value at a specific time step, and α = {c 1 , …, c 9 } are the coefficients of the PLD basis vectors. The first epoch, which captured a partial transit of V1298 Tau b over approximately 11.5 h, was fitted well by including a linear trend in addition to PLD. The second epoch, which contained transits of both planets c and d over an approximately 14-h baseline, exhibited significant nonlinear variability that required the inclusion of a basis spline. Similarly, the third epoch, containing a full transit of planet b over approximately 12.5 h, also warranted the inclusion of a basis spline; although IRAC1 systematics are typically larger than those of IRAC2, PLD performed well and we attribute this to stellar variability. We validated our approach of selecting the baseline model by inspecting the fit residuals for the longest and most complex observation (the second epoch). A quantitative comparison confirmed that a basis spline was strongly preferred over a simple linear trend by the Bayesian information criterion59.\n\nGround-based observations\n\nMost of our follow-up transit observations were obtained from 2020 to 2024 using LCO. We primarily used the Sinistro53 and MuSCAT3 instruments on the 1-m and 2-m telescopes, respectively.\n\nIn addition to LCO, we used data from a variety of other facilities, including Apache Point Observatory (APO)/Astrophysical Research Consortium Telescope Imaging Camera (ARCTIC)60, Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory/KeplerCam61, WIYN/half degree imager62, Three-hundred MilliMeter Telescope63, MuSCAT64, MuSCAT265 and Araki/ADLER. Data were obtained using a variety of filters and reduced using standard pipelines and methods66,67,68,69,70,71. See Supplementary Information for more details.\n\nRecovering planet e\n\nThe outermost planet, V1298 Tau e, transited only once during the K2 mission. TESS recovered transits of all four planets, including a second transit of planet e10. It was not clear how many transits occurred between the K2 and TESS observations given the 6.5-year gap between the two campaigns. Thus, a discrete comb of periods was allowed, such that P = Δt/n, where Δt is the measured time between transit midpoints and the integer \\(n=1,2,3,\\ldots ,{n}_{\\max }\\). The upper bound on n, and thus, the lower bound on a period of 42.7 days, was provided by the absence of other transits by planet e within the K2 and TESS time series10.\n\nBy the summer of 2022, a preliminary version of our timing dataset had revealed large TTVs of planet b that we assumed were dominated by interactions with planet e. We ran a suite of TTV models at each of the possible P e between 42.7 days and 120 days. Few trial periods yielded good fits to the timing dataset, and dynamical simulations revealed that only a fraction of those were stable over \\({\\mathcal{O}}(1{0}^{6})\\) years. One of the stable solutions with P e = 48.7 days corresponded to a near 2:1 commensurability for the b–e pair, a common configuration among the Kepler planets exhibiting large and detectable TTVs. With this prediction, we recovered a partial transit of planet e from the ground on 18 October 2022. LCO datasets used to recover planet e and confirm its orbital period are shown in Extended Data Fig. 4.\n\nDatasets containing flares\n\nSeveral observations were affected by stellar flares and were excluded from our TTV analyses to avoid potential timing measurement biases. These datasets were modelled using our standard approach, augmented with a parametric flare model72 (Extended Data Fig. 5). Significant flares were observed in ARCTIC data (12 October 2020; see also ref. 38), KeplerCam data (24 September 2023) and LCO data (18 December 2023), with amplitudes ranging from 6 parts per thousand (ppt) to 42 ppt and timescales of 14 min to 21 min. The parameters of these flares are detailed in the Supplementary Information, and they may prove valuable for future studies of the activity of V1298 Tau.\n\nMass constraints from analytic TTV modelling\n\nTo build intuition for the system dynamics, we first performed a preliminary analysis using analytic models of TTVs. Based on the foundational analytic frameworks for TTVs11,12,73, we determined that the system dynamics can be effectively decoupled into two pairs of planets: c–d and b–e.\n\nTo quantify the TTV behaviour, we fitted a multi-harmonic sinusoidal model to the transit time series (see Supplementary Information for the model equations). We explored the posterior distributions of the 16 model parameters using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, like approaches used by other public TTV analysis codes74,75. The posteriors of these parameters are listed in Supplementary Table 3, and the model fits are shown in Extended Data Fig. 6.\n\nThe results for the c–d pair are consistent with the planets being in a near-resonant regime. The TTVs are described well by a single sinusoid with a period P cd = 1,604 ± 12 days and an r.m.s. of the residuals of only 11 min. This sinusoidal signal is dominated by variations in the planetary mean longitudes (λ), characteristic of systems very close to resonance. The ratio of the TTV amplitudes is sensitive to the planetary mass ratio, indicating nearly equal masses (M d /M c ≈ 1.2). From the full fit, we derived preliminary masses \\({M}_{{\\rm{c}}}\\approx {2.7}_{-0.8}^{+1.7}\\) M ⊕ and \\({M}_{{\\rm{d}}}\\approx {3.2}_{-1.0}^{+2.1}\\) M ⊕ .\n\nBy contrast, the b–e pair is described well by a simpler, linear TTV model, as it is further from resonance. The TTVs arising from variations in mean longitude and eccentricity have the same frequency in this regime. In this case, a well-known degeneracy exists between the planet masses and their orbital eccentricities16,76, leading to broader initial constraints of \\({M}_{{\\rm{b}}}=3{1}_{-17}^{+14}\\) M ⊕ and \\({M}_{{\\rm{e}}}=2{4}_{-8}^{+4}\\) M ⊕ . A full theoretical treatment and a discussion of strategies for breaking the mass–eccentricity degeneracy, such as measuring secondary eclipse times77, can be found in the Supplementary Information.\n\nMass constraints from N-body TTV modelling\n\nGuided by our analytic models, our primary analysis relies on a full N-body dynamical model to derive the final planet parameters. We fitted the model to the observed transit times using a Bayesian framework. To be robust against outlier measurements, we adopted a log-likelihood function based on Student’s t-distribution78,79, with priors as listed in Extended Data Table 2. The posterior probability distribution was sampled using the No-U-Turn Sampler80,81. The model is implemented in JAX to enable automatic differentiation and is available as part of the jnkepler package27,82. The full mathematical details of the model implementation, the log-likelihood equation and the sampler set-up are provided in the Supplementary Information. The resulting mass and eccentricity posterior distributions are shown in Extended Data Fig. 7.\n\nTo verify the physical plausibility of our solution, we performed a detailed dynamical analysis of the posterior. We investigated both the long-term stability and the resonant state of the system using several complementary methods. First, to assess stability, we used a probabilistic classifier (SPOCK)83 on 1,000 samples from our posterior, which yielded a median stability probability of 95% over 109 orbits. We confirmed this with direct N-body integrations of 128 samples for 1 Myr, which showed that the system is deeply stable and regular (minimum separation over 12R H (mutual Hill radii), maximum semimajor axis drift of less than 0.01%, and MEGNO (Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) = 2.000). As a final check, we integrated 32 posterior samples for 4 Myr, all of which were found to be stable. Second, to characterize the resonant state, our integrations show that all classical resonant angles are circulating, which we confirmed by projecting our solution onto the resonant representative plane12. The solution lies clearly outside the resonant island where libration would occur, confirming the non-resonant nature of the system.\n\nInitial thermal state and planetary evolution\n\nYoung planets with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres contract over time due to mass loss and thermal evolution. Reference 32 showed that young planets with measured masses and radii can be used to constrain their initial entropies. Planets with a measured mass and radius have a degeneracy between their hydrogen envelope mass fraction and their thermal state. The hydrogen envelope mass of the planet can be reduced and compensated for by an increase in its entropy. However, this can only go so far; the envelope mass cannot be reduced arbitrarily to the point where it is too small to survive mass loss. Thus, one can place a bound on the initial entropy of the planet such that it survives until today. To perform this calculation, we computed a grid of MESA evolutionary models that include photoevaporation (a comparison with ref. 84 indicates that these planets will be undergoing photoevaporation rather than core-powered mass loss). This model grid comprised 36 core masses, 128 initial mass fractions and 96 initial entropies. We used an identical method to that in ref. 32. We then compared this model grid with the observed masses and radii of the V1298 Tau planets to derive posterior distributions of the core masses, initial envelope mass fractions and initial entropies (which we encode as the initial Kelvin–Helmholtz cooling timescale of the planets). Our results indicate that all the planets had initial envelope mass fractions and core masses that are consistent with typical sub-Neptunes at billion year ages. Furthermore, the initial cooling timescales are constrained to require boil-off for planets c and d, whereas an evolution without boil-off cannot be ruled out for the outer planets. Extended Data Fig. 8 shows the models that best reproduce the present-day masses and radii of planets c and d. Interestingly, they require an initial low entropy; that is, an initial Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction time that is longer than the age of the system. Furthermore, if one considers only models with a high initial entropy, one can match the current mass or radius, but not both.",

      "summary": "Scientists have detected a surprisingly hot galaxy cluster dating back to the universe’s infancy. The cluster formed far earlier and burned far hotter than current models predict. Researchers believe supermassive black holes may have rapidly heated the surrounding gas. The finding could force a major rethink of how galaxy clusters grow.",
      "content": "A team of astronomers from several countries, led by researchers in Canada, has identified a galaxy cluster that appears far earlier and far hotter than current science predicts. The cluster is filled with intensely hot gas and existed just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. According to established theories, galaxy clusters at this stage should not yet reach such extreme temperatures.\n\nThe findings, published on January 5 in Nature, raise serious challenges for widely accepted models of galaxy cluster formation. Those models suggest that clusters gradually heat up over time and only reach these temperatures much later, after becoming larger and more stable.\n\n\"We didn't expect to see such a hot cluster atmosphere so early in cosmic history,\" said lead author Dazhi Zhou, a PhD candidate in the UBC department of physics and astronomy. \"In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real. But after months of verification, we've confirmed this gas is at least five times hotter than predicted, and even hotter and more energetic than what we find in many present-day clusters.\"\n\nDr. Scott Chapman, a co-author and professor at Dalhousie University who carried out the research while at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), said the results point to powerful activity in the young universe. \"This tells us that something in the early universe, likely three recently discovered supermassive black holes in the cluster, were already pumping huge amounts of energy into the surroundings and shaping the young cluster, much earlier and more strongly than we thought.\"\n\nInvestigating a Baby Galaxy Cluster\n\nTo make the discovery, the researchers looked back roughly 12 billion years to study a young galaxy cluster known as SPT2349-56. Observations were carried out using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), a network of radio telescopes that includes instruments designed, built, and tested by the NRC.\n\nDespite its age, this cluster is already remarkably large. Its central region spans about 500,000 light years, similar in size to the halo surrounding the Milky Way. The cluster contains more than 30 active galaxies packed closely together and is producing new stars at a rate more than 5,000 times higher than that of our own galaxy.\n\nTo measure the heat within the cluster, the team relied on a technique known as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. This approach allows scientists to estimate the thermal energy of the intracluster medium:the gas existing between the galaxies of a given cluster.\n\n\"Understanding galaxy clusters is the key to understanding the biggest galaxies in the universe,\" said Dr. Chapman, who is also a UBC affiliate professor. \"These massive galaxies mostly reside in clusters, and their evolution is heavily shaped by the very strong environment of the clusters as they form, including the intracluster medium.\"\n\nHow Supermassive Black Holes May Be Heating Clusters\n\nCurrent theories suggest that the gas making up the intracluster medium slowly gathers and heats up as gravity pulls an unstable galaxy cluster inward over time. As the cluster matures, this process is expected to produce a stable and hot environment. The new observations suggest a much more violent beginning, where heating happens earlier and more rapidly than predicted.\n\nZhou and his colleagues now plan to study how the different forces inside the cluster work together. \"We want to figure out how the intense star formation, the active black holes and this overheated atmosphere interact, and what it tells us about how present galaxy clusters were built,\" Zhou said. \"How can all of this be happening at once in such a young, compact system?\"",
