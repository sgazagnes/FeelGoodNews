      "summary": "Powerful forces are lining up to undermine global cooperation, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned at a landmark event in London on Saturday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the General Assembly, but he urged that “humanity is strongest when we stand as one”. ",
      "content": "Speaking at Methodist Central Hall, the very same venue where the first-ever UN General Assembly was held on 10 January 1946, Mr. Guterres called on delegates at the event to be “bold enough to change. Bold enough to find the courage of those who came to this Hall 80 years ago to forge a better world.”\n\nTweet URL\n\nFrom bomb shelter to diplomatic gathering\n\nOrganised by the United Nations Association-UK, Saturday's anniversary event gathered over 1,000 delegates from across the world, with speakers including President of the General Assembly, Annalena Baerbock, the UN Champion for Space Professor Brian Cox and the UN Refugee Agency’s Goodwill Ambassador Maya Ghazal. The event also marks the 80th anniversary of the first UN Security Council, which took place on 17 January 1946 at nearby Church House.\n\nDuring his keynote address, Mr. Guterres reflected on the symbolic location of the commemoration. The first General Assembly took place within the same walls four months after the end of the Second World War, in a heavily bombed London where tens of thousands had been killed, a powerful reminder as to why the UN had been created.\n\n“To reach this Hall, delegates had to pass through a city scarred by war. Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and the House of Commons had been shelled by the Luftwaffe. And as those bombs fell, terrified civilians huddled here, in the basement of the Methodist Central Hall — one of the largest public air-raid shelters in London,” said the Secretary-General.\n\nThroughout the Blitz, as many as 2,000 people gathered in the hall for protection, before the nations of the world assembled there in 1946 to ‘save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’.\n\n“In many ways, this Hall is a physical representation of what the United Nations is: a place people put their faith — for peace, for security, for a better life,” reflected Mr. Guterres.\n\nThe world of 2026 is not the world of 1946\n\nIn the 80 years since the first General Assembly, the UN has expanded from 51 members to 193. Mr. Guterres emphasised that the General Assembly, the UN’s chief deliberative, policymaking and representative body, is “the parliament of the family of nations. It is a forum for every voice to be heard, a crucible for consensus, and a beacon for cooperation.”\n\nWhilst he acknowledged that the General Assembly’s work “may not always be straightforward or seamless,” he described it as a “a mirror of our world, its divisions and its hopes. And it is the stage on which our shared story plays out.”\n\nReflecting on the last decade, Mr. Guterres spoke of how “the conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan have been vicious and cruel beyond measure; artificial intelligence has become ubiquitous almost overnight; and the pandemic poured accelerant on the fires of nationalism — stalling progress on development and climate action.”\n\nMr. Guterres emphasised how 2025 was a “profoundly challenging” year for international cooperation and the UN’s values.\n\n“Aid was slashed. Inequalities widened. Climate chaos accelerated. International law was trampled. Crackdowns on civil society intensified. Journalists were killed with impunity. And United Nations staff were repeatedly threatened — or killed — in the line of duty.”\n\nThe UN reported in 2025 that global military spending reached $2.7 trillion — over 200 times the UK’s current aid budget, or equivalent to over 70 per cent of Britain’s entire economy.\n\nFossil fuel profits have also continued to surge whilst the planet broke heat records, Mr. Guterres underlined.\n\n“And in cyberspace, algorithms rewarded falsehoods, fuelled hatred, and provided authoritarians with powerful tools of control.”\n\nMultilateralism over division\n\nA “robust, responsive and well-resourced multilateral” system is needed to address the world’s interconnected challenges, Mr. Guterres urged, but the “values of multilateralism are being chipped away.”\n\nThe Secretary-General gave the example of a landmark international agreement to protect marine life in international waters and the seabed, which comes into force on Saturday, as a “model of modern diplomacy, led by science, with the participation not just of governments, but of civil society, Indigenous Peoples and local communities.”\n\n“These quiet victories of international cooperation — the wars prevented, the famine averted, the vital treaties secured — do not always make the headlines. Yet they are real. And they matter. If we wish to secure more such victories, we must ensure the full respect of international law and defend multilateralism, strengthening it for our times.”\n\nAs he addressed the London audience, the Secretary-General expressed his “gratitude to the United Kingdom for its decisive role in creating the United Nations,” and for being “such a strong pillar of multilateralism and champion of the United Nations today.”\n\n© United Nations/Shaun Ottway UN Secretary-General António Guterres (right) met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at 10 Downing Street in London on Friday.\n\nHigh stakes for a better world\n\nLooking towards the future, the Secretary-General called for an international system that reflects the modern world, including reforming international financial systems and the Security Council.\n\n“As global centres of power shift, we have the potential to build a future that is either more fair — or more unstable.”\n\nThe Secretary-General reminded delegates in London that when the UN first opened its doors, “many of its staff bore the visible wounds of war — a limp, a scar, a burn.”\n\n“There is a persistent myth — now echoing louder each day — that peace is naïve. That the only ‘real’ politics is the politics of self-interest and force,” Mr. Guterres said.\n\n“But the founders of the United Nations were not untouched by reality. On the contrary, they had seen war, and they knew: Peace, justice and equality, are the most courageous, the most practical, the most necessary pursuits of all.”\n\n*Miranda Alexander-Webber is a communications officer with the United Nations Regional Information Centre for Western Europe (UNRIC).",

      "summary": "European Commissioner for Trade Maroš Šefčovič, after visiting Cyprus, recalled that Europeans had concerns about the CETA agreement, just as they do now about the agreement with MERCOSUR.",
      "content": "European Commissioner for Trade Maroš Šefčovič, after visiting Cyprus, recalled that Europeans had concerns about the CETA agreement, just as they do now about the agreement with MERCOSUR.\n\nLimassol – The free trade agreement with the Mercosur countries continues to raise concerns and criticism from the member states of the European Union (EU) and farmers, but there is no need to fear it. EU Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maroš Šefčovič stated this for TASR.\n\nMaroš Šefčovič on Thursday (15 January) – before Friday’s departure for Paraguay, where he is accompanying the President of the European Commission (EC) Ursula von der Leyen and the President of the European Council Antonio Costa, who will sign the agreement with the Mercosur countries on behalf of the EU – took part in a joint meeting of the College of Commissioners with members of the Cypriot government in the Cypriot port of Limassol.\n\nHe welcomed the fact that the Cypriot Presidency of the Council of the EU on 9 January secured a vote in which a qualified majority of member countries supported the agreement with Mercosur. After it is signed in Paraguay, the same process awaits this agreement in the European Parliament and subsequently Cyprus will be responsible for ensuring its ratification by the member states as quickly as possible.\n\nŠefčovič recalled that the EU has already experienced a similar situation when approving the trade agreement with Canada (CETA).\n\n“Canada is the latest example where the conclusion of the agreement was also preceded by very intense discussion, and the concerns of the food industry community were very strong. Today, eight years after its conclusion, there is absolute satisfaction, also because mutual trade has increased by 60 percent,” he explained.\n\nHe added that none of the negative scenarios materialised in the case of CETA. The agreement is advantageous for farmers, for engineers, and it significantly helps both the European and Canadian economies.\n\n“The agreement with Mercosur also contains sufficiently strong guarantees, both financial and administrative. Let’s say that farmers will not be endangered. The mechanisms that the European Commission proposed for their protection were approved in the European Parliament,” he pointed out.\n\nAccording to him, the EC approached this agreement with exceptional sensitivity. All import quotas in the area of sensitive commodities such as beef, ethanol or chicken meat were carefully set. Under no circumstances can they pose a threat to European farmers.\n\n“At the same time, we have introduced unprecedented legal guarantees that provide such protection for European farmers that if imports from Mercosur countries were to rise by five percent or if the price of these sensitive commodities were to jump by five percent on the European market, then the European Commission would have to intervene. It can apply emergency brakes. All specific measures to protect farmers were summarised in a European regulation, the strongest legal instrument the EU has at its disposal,” he described the situation.\n\nThe Commission is also continuing to work on aligning procedures in the area of pesticide use, in the area of animal welfare, on increasing controls through European veterinary audits of goods from Mercosur countries, as well as in the main points of import, which are European ports and airports.\n\n“Everything possible has been done to ensure that products and commodities imported into Europe from these countries meet the most demanding European criteria. As an additional safeguard, a financial guarantee was approved in the form of a so‑called safety net for farmers amounting to 6.3 billion euros. I consider this a kind of insurance,” said Šefčovič. And he expressed his conviction that, just as in the case of Canada, there will be no negative trends in the implementation of the agreements with Mercosur and that everyone will be pleasantly surprised by the significant impact this will have on the economies of the Mercosur countries and the EU countries.

The Mercosur agreement includes strong rules to protect European farmers and industries, such as limits on sensitive imports and a financial safety net of 6.3 billion euros.\n\n**Impact** – This agreement is important because it aims to increase trade between the EU and Mercosur countries while protecting local farmers and industries from sudden market changes.

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 15 January 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03342-8Small acts of change have helped me to reset and give myself a break.",
      "content": "People with PhDs say they spent years during their studies feeling exhausted and lost their work–life balance. Credit: Getty\n\nI have just started the fourth year of my PhD. As I reflect on where the time has gone, I realize that my mental health is not where I want it to be.\n\nI’ve been fortunate to have a supportive adviser and an incredible laboratory environment at Stanford University in California — that includes some of the most wonderful people I’ve ever worked with. But even with that, there’s a broader academic culture that seeps into the habits of many researchers — one that rewards burnout and discourages rest.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I started wearing burnout like a badge of honour. In weekly lab check-ins, I make sure to mention I was in the lab over the weekend — slipping in a quiet signal that I was going above and beyond. I’ve made sure to send e-mails early in the morning or late at night to demonstrate I was working long hours.\n\nI’m exhausted. Doesn’t that mean I’m doing something right?\n\nIt wasn’t until my mother visited me in July that something shifted. She stayed with me for a few days, and although we spent time together — walking outside, catching up over dinner — she noticed I wasn’t really ‘there’ in the moment. I looked pale, she told my partner later. She could see that the PhD journey was taking a toll on me.\n\nThis list of non-negotiables helped me to defeat PhD-student guilt\n\nAfter she left, I talked to a lab mate about it. I said I was trying to find my equilibrium again. My lab mate said, “You’re taking a step away. I’m so excited for you.”\n\nI immediately got defensive. “I’m not slacking,” I said. “I’m not falling behind!” This culture of burnout can be especially difficult for students, including myself, who don’t plan to pursue a career in academia. When academic work is exhausting and your research is meant to receive your all, it leaves little time for other necessities, such as career exploration, hobbies and socializing — all of which are essential for a career and a life beyond the lab.\n\nThat’s part of why I started PhD Paths a little over a year ago, an extracurricular project for which I’ve interviewed 300 PhD holders who’ve transitioned to careers beyond academia. I share their written interviews by means of a Google Sheets database, website and newsletter. It began as a personal attempt to explore what other career avenues were possible, after realizing that I did not want to stay in academia. PhD Paths has grown into a community of thousands of readers and contributors, challenging the narrative that there’s only one ‘successful’ path for PhD students.\n\nUsing these interviews, I share the stories of those who’ve gone before — to show the diverse career opportunities that a PhD can lead to, and to remind others that they’re not alone.\n\nI ask each interviewee: “Why did you decide to not pursue a career in academia?” The most common reason was the culture of the academic world. In fact, more than half of the people I interviewed said that some component of the academic culture drove them away. They described poor work–life balance, relentless pressure to publish and an undercurrent of stress that never let up.\n\nThe exhaustion identity\n\nIn academia, there’s a curious ritual when someone asks, “How are you?” The correct answer is never “great” or “well-rested”. It’s “busy” or “exhausted”. The idea being that, if you’re not tired, you’re not working hard enough. As a scientist, I’ve tied my identity to exhaustion.\n\nThrough these conversations, I’ve learnt that my experience isn’t unusual. Again and again, interviewees have told me that they spent years during their PhD studies feeling exhausted, from working too many hours, and had lost their work–life balance. They were amazed at the flexibility and minimal stress that they experienced when they stepped out of academia and into an industry position.\n\nThat’s why I’ve shared these stories beyond my own circle. What began with two viral posts that introduced the PhD Paths resource — which together reached more than one million impressions on LinkedIn — has grown into a personal audience of more than 24,000 followers on the social-media platform, as well as a PhD Paths newsletter reaching more than 7,000 readers.",

      "content": "EU Commissioner for Trade Maroš Šefčovič, during his visit to Cyprus, praised the support of the Cypriot Presidency of the Council of the EU for the EC’s trade policy.\n\nLimassol – The Cypriot Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) is willing to help the European Commission (EC) in achieving its trade and economic objectives. EU Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maroš Šefčovič stated this for TASR’s correspondent on Thursday after a joint meeting of the College of Commissioners with members of the Cypriot government, chaired by EC President Ursula von der Leyen and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides in Limassol.\n\nMaroš Šefčovič expressed satisfaction that the European Commission and the incoming Cypriot Presidency agree on two fundamental priorities. First and foremost, this concerns European economic security, where concrete steps must be taken to ensure this security, whether through better information sharing between Member States and EU institutions or through the creation of a European network of national advisers for economic security.\n\n“And then, of course, there are negotiations with our trading partners. On the one hand, cooperation on completing the ratification of the agreement with the Mercosur countries, which is to be signed this weekend; then, of course, there is great interest in concluding the agreement with India, but it is also about speeding up negotiations with the Gulf countries, since Cyprus knows this geographical area very well,” Šefčovič explained.\n\nHe confirmed that the EC will also need the help of the Cypriot Presidency to speed up the ratification of the trade agreement with Mexico, because it is a very important global player in terms of imports of food and agricultural commodities.\n\nIn April, the Cypriot Presidency will prepare an extraordinary summit focused on the Mediterranean agreement, to which it will invite leaders from the Middle East and North Africa. The Cypriot president emphasized the importance of the summit for strengthening not only security and migration interests, but also the Union’s trade relations.\n\n“We in the European Commission believe that for cooperation between countries and for businesses it is better if barriers are reduced, and not the other way around, if we operate in a space that is clearly defined by internationally recognized rules and with respect for international trade law,” Šefčovič said. He added that the EC therefore supports every activity that would lead to reducing barriers and to mutually beneficial trade in the sense that it will also increase opportunities for European producers and traders to open new contacts and business relations.
