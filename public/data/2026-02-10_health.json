      "content": "A type of cognitive training that tests people's quick recall seems to reduce the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease\n\nCognitive training could arm the brain against the effects of dementia Gary Burchell/Getty Images\n\nCognitive “speed training” can reduce the risk of a dementia diagnosis by 25 per cent – that’s according to results from the world’s first randomised controlled trial of any intervention against the condition.\n\n“There was a lot of scepticism about whether or not brain training interventions were beneficial, and to me, [our study] answers the question that they are,” says Marilyn Albert at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrain training has generated controversy for years. Early enthusiasm waned after several brain-training companies that had promised protection against cognitive decline were found to be overstating their benefits.\n\nIn 2014, almost 70 scientists signed an open letter saying that there was no conclusive evidence that brain training produced changes that had real-world relevance or promoted brain health. Months later, another open letter signed by more than 100 scientists countered their arguments.\n\nNow, a 20-year study of 2832 people aged 65 and older suggests specific exercises may offer benefits.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThe participants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups or to a control group. One group engaged in speed training, using a computer-based task called Double Decision, which briefly displays a car and a road sign within a scene before they disappear. Participants must then recall which car appeared and where the sign was located. The task is adaptive, becoming harder as performance improves.\n\nThe other two groups took part in memory or reasoning training, learning strategies designed to improve those skills.\n\nThe participants completed two 60-75-minute sessions per week for five weeks. About half of those in each group were then randomly assigned to receive booster sessions – four additional 1-hour sessions at the end of the first year, and another four at the end of the third year.\n\nTwenty years later, the researchers assessed US Medicare claims data to determine how many of the participants had been diagnosed with dementia. They found that those who completed speed training with booster sessions had a 25 per cent lower risk of diagnosis with Alzheimer’s or a related dementia compared with the control group. No other group – including speed training without boosters – showed a significant change in risk. “The size of the effect is really quite astonishing,” says Albert.\n\n“The analysis seems rigorous,” says Torkel Klingberg at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. “It is impressive to have a 20-year follow-up, and reducing the risk score for dementia is an impressive and important result.”\n\nWalter Boot at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York state cautions that the team measured many outcomes over the 20-year period, including mental health. “The more outcomes that are examined and the more statistical tests that are conducted, the greater the likelihood that at least one result will look meaningful, even if the intervention itself had no true impact,” he says. “This does not mean the findings are wrong, but it does mean they should be interpreted cautiously.”\n\nIn Double Decision, users are tested on their speed, attention and peripheral vision by focusing on one of two centre targets and a peripheral one. As the speed of the programme increases, the centre targets get more similar, and the peripheral distractions multiply BrainHQ\n\nWhy speed training might work remains unclear. One possibility is its reliance on implicit learning, which occurs without conscious awareness. “We know that changes that occur from this kind of learning are very long-lasting,” says Albert. What’s more, although the duration of the training was relatively modest, it was demanding. “You really have to pay attention, and it gets harder if you do it well,” she says.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of short experiences that drive long-lasting changes in the brain, says Etienne De Villers-Sidani at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. For example, a single car crash can induce a lifelong fear of driving.\n\nHe suggests that speed training may build brain reserve – a kind of cognitive buffer against damage. If you assume cognition diminishes at a particular threshold of damage, then a brain with more neurons and connections is going to succumb later.\n\nAlbert adds that altered brain connectivity might also help people divide their attention more effectively, making it easier to navigate daily life as they age. This could then reduce isolation, encourage greater activity or increase social engagement – things known to contribute to long-term brain health.\n\nThe authors also claim that the results for the booster group might reflect speed training having a dose-dependent effect. Bobby Stojanoski at Ontario Tech University says that future work should focus on this relationship: “What is the optimal amount of training?”\n\nThe take-home message, says Andrew Budson at Boston University, is “not that everyone should go into their windowless basement and start doing speed training games on their computer”. But activities that use implicit learning may be beneficial in delaying the effects of Alzheimer’s disease. “Learning a new sport, vocation or craft is likely to produce long-lasting [beneficial] changes in the brain, in addition to any enjoyment you derive from engaging in these activities.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, affects many older adults, and scientists have long searched for ways to reduce its risk. Brain training exercises have been popular but controversial, with mixed evidence about whether they actually help protect the brain.\n\n**What happened** – A 20-year study of 2,832 people aged 65 and older tested three types of brain training: speed training, memory training, and reasoning training. The speed training used a computer game called Double Decision, where players quickly identify a car and road sign in a scene. Participants did two sessions per week for five weeks, with some receiving extra booster sessions later. After 20 years, those who did speed training plus boosters had a 25% lower chance of being diagnosed with dementia compared to those who didn’t train.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first large, long-term experiment to show that a specific brain exercise can reduce dementia risk. The speed training challenges attention, quick thinking, and vision, which may strengthen brain connections and build a “cognitive reserve” to delay symptoms. The study offers a clear example of how targeted mental activities could help protect aging brains.\n\n**What’s next step** – Researchers want to find the best amount of speed training and understand exactly how it helps the brain. They also suggest trying other activities that use similar learning skills, like learning new hobbies or sports, to see if they offer the same benefits.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Regular speed-based brain training, especially with booster sessions, can lower the risk of dementia by strengthening the brain’s ability to process information quickly over time.",

      "summary": "A long-term study found that women who closely followed a Mediterranean diet had a much lower risk of stroke. The strongest benefits were seen in women who ate more plant-based foods, fish, and olive oil while cutting back on red meat and saturated fats. Their risk dropped across all major stroke types, including bleeding strokes, which are less commonly studied. The findings suggest diet may be a powerful but overlooked factor in stroke prevention.",
      "content": "Women who follow a Mediterranean-style eating pattern may face a lower risk of stroke, according to research published on February 4, 2026, in Neurology Open Access, a journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study found a strong relationship between this diet and reduced stroke risk, though it does not show that the diet directly prevents strokes. Instead, it identifies an association between dietary habits and long-term health outcomes.\n\nResearchers observed lower rates of stroke overall among women who most closely followed the Mediterranean diet. This included both ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked and are the most common form of stroke. Hemorrhagic strokes happen when a blood vessel ruptures and causes bleeding in the brain.\n\nWhat Defines the Mediterranean Diet\n\nThe Mediterranean diet centers on eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and fish, along with healthy fats such as olive oil. It limits foods like dairy products, meat, and items high in saturated fatty acids.\n\n\"Our findings support the mounting evidence that a healthy diet is critical to stroke prevention,\" said study author Sophia S. Wang, PhD, of City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California. \"We were especially interested to see that this finding applies to hemorrhagic stroke, as few large studies have looked at this type of stroke.\"\n\nHow the Study Followed More Than 100,000 Women\n\nThe study included 105,614 women who had no history of stroke at the beginning of the research and an average age of 53. Each participant completed a detailed diet questionnaire at the start of the study. Researchers then assigned a score ranging from zero to nine based on how closely each person's diet matched Mediterranean diet guidelines.\n\nParticipants earned one point for consuming more than the population average of whole grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and fish, as well as for drinking a moderate amount of alcohol. They also earned a point for eating less red meat and dairy than average. About 30% of participants scored between six and nine -- the highest group. Another 13% scored between zero and two, placing them in the lowest group.\n\nStroke Outcomes Over 21 Years\n\nParticipants were monitored for an average of 21 years. During that period, researchers recorded 4,083 strokes, including 3,358 ischemic strokes and 725 hemorrhagic strokes. Among women in the highest diet score group, 1,058 ischemic strokes occurred, compared with 395 cases in the lowest group. For hemorrhagic stroke, 211 cases were reported in the highest group and 91 in the lowest group.\n\nAfter accounting for other stroke risk factors such as smoking, physical activity, and high blood pressure, the differences remained significant. Women with the highest Mediterranean diet scores were 18% less likely to experience any stroke than those with the lowest scores. Their risk of ischemic stroke was 16% lower, and their risk of hemorrhagic stroke was 25% lower.\n\nWhy the Findings Matter and Study Limitations\n\n\"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, so it's exciting to think that improving our diets could lessen our risk for this devastating disease,\" said Wang. \"Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to help us understand the mechanisms behind them so we could identify new ways to prevent stroke.\"\n\nOne limitation of the study is that dietary information was self reported, which means some participants may not have recalled their eating habits accurately.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke.",

      "title": "A secret cell alliance may explain why ovarian cancer is so deadly",
      "summary": "Scientists have discovered why ovarian cancer spreads so rapidly through the abdomen. Cancer cells enlist normally protective abdominal cells, forming mixed groups that work together to invade new tissue. These helper cells lead the way, allowing cancer to spread faster and resist chemotherapy. The findings uncover a critical weakness that future treatments may target.",
      "content": "Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer, largely because it is usually discovered too late. In most cases, doctors diagnose the disease only after it has already spread widely throughout the abdomen. Although researchers have long known that ovarian cancer progresses rapidly, the biological reason behind this speed has remained unclear.\n\nA new study led by Nagoya University now sheds light on this long-standing mystery. The research, published in Science Advances, shows that ovarian cancer cells do not act alone. Instead, they enlist help from mesothelial cells, which normally serve as a protective lining inside the abdominal cavity. These mesothelial cells move ahead of the cancer cells, creating pathways that cancer cells then follow. Together, they form hybrid cell clusters that are more resistant to chemotherapy than cancer cells by themselves.\n\nCancer Cells Form Hybrid Clusters in Abdominal Fluid\n\nTo understand how this happens, researchers analyzed abdominal fluid from patients with ovarian cancer. What they found challenged previous assumptions. Cancer cells were rarely drifting freely on their own. Instead, they frequently attached themselves to mesothelial cells, forming compact, mixed cell spheres.\n\nThe researchers estimated that roughly 60% of these cancer spheres included recruited mesothelial cells. The cancer cells release a signaling molecule known as TGF-β1, which alters the mesothelial cells. In response, the mesothelial cells develop sharp, spike-like protrusions capable of cutting through surrounding tissue.\n\nHow Ovarian Cancer Moves Through the Abdomen\n\nAs ovarian cancer grows, some cells detach from the main tumor and enter the fluid-filled space within the abdomen. This fluid is constantly in motion due to normal breathing and body movement. As a result, cancer cells are carried to many different areas of the abdominal cavity.\n\nThis method of spread differs sharply from that of many other cancers. In diseases such as breast or lung cancer, tumor cells enter blood vessels and travel through the bloodstream to distant organs. Because blood flows through defined pathways, doctors can sometimes monitor these cancers using blood tests.\n\nOvarian cancer cells largely bypass blood vessels. Instead, they drift through abdominal fluid that lacks a predictable route. This floating phase occurs before the cells attach to new organs. Until now, scientists did not fully understand what occurred during this stage or how cancer cells coordinated their spread so efficiently.\n\nInvadopodia Drive Tissue Invasion\n\nThe research team found that during this floating stage, ovarian cancer cells actively recruit mesothelial cells that have naturally shed from the abdominal lining. Once joined together, the two cell types form hybrid spheres. The mesothelial cells then produce invadopodia, which are spike-like structures that drill into nearby tissue.\n\nThese hybrid spheres pose a particular threat. When they reach an organ, they invade tissue more rapidly and withstand chemotherapy drugs more effectively than cancer cells alone.\n\nWatching Cancer Spread in Real Time\n\nUsing advanced microscopy, the scientists were able to observe this process directly in abdominal fluid samples from patients. They validated their observations with experiments in mouse models and by analyzing gene activity at the single-cell level.\n\nLead author Dr. Kaname Uno, a former PhD student and current Visiting Researcher at Nagoya University's Graduate School of Medicine, explained that the cancer cells themselves remain relatively unchanged. \"They manipulate mesothelial cells to do the tissue invasion work. They undergo minimal genetic and molecular changes and just migrate through the openings that mesothelial cells create.\"\n\nBefore entering research, Dr. Uno spent eight years working as a gynecologist. One patient profoundly shaped his decision to pursue this line of study. She had received normal screening results just three months before doctors diagnosed her with advanced ovarian cancer. Existing diagnostic tools failed to detect the disease early enough to save her life. That experience motivated Dr. Uno to investigate why ovarian cancer spreads so quickly and escapes early detection.\n\nNew Opportunities for Treatment and Monitoring\n\nThe findings point to potential new approaches for treating ovarian cancer. Current chemotherapy drugs focus on destroying cancer cells but do not target the mesothelial cells that assist in invasion. Future therapies could aim to block the TGF-β1 signal or prevent the formation of these harmful cell partnerships.\n\nThe study also suggests a possible new way to track the disease. Monitoring these hybrid cell clusters in abdominal fluid could help doctors better predict how ovarian cancer will progress and how patients respond to treatment.\n\nOvarian cancer kills more women than any other gynecological cancer. Most patients receive their diagnosis only after the disease spreads throughout the abdomen. Until now, scientists have never fully understood why this cancer advances so fast.\n\nA new study led by Nagoya University explains why. Published in Science Advances, the study shows that cancer cells recruit help from protective mesothelial cells that normally line the abdominal cavity. Mesothelial cells lead the invasion and cancer cells follow the pathways they create. These hybrid cell clusters resist chemotherapy better than cancer alone.\n\nResearchers examined abdominal fluid from ovarian cancer patients and found something unexpected. Cancer cells do not float alone in the abdominal cavity. Instead, they often grab onto mesothelial cells and form hybrid spheres. About 60% of all cancer spheres contain these recruited mesothelial cells. The cancer cells release a protein called TGF-β1 that transforms the mesothelial cells and causes them to develop spike-like structures that cut through tissue.\n\nInvadopodia, spike structures that do the digging for cancer\n\nWhen ovarian cancer develops, cancer cells break off from the tumor. These cells enter the abdominal fluid and float freely. The fluid moves around as you breathe and move your body. This movement carries the cancer cells to different spots in the abdomen.\n\nMost other cancers spread differently. Breast cancer or lung cancer cells enter blood vessels. They travel through the bloodstream to reach distant organs. Doctors can sometimes track these cancers through blood tests because blood moves in predictable paths through vessels.\n\nOvarian cancer cells avoid blood vessels entirely. They float in fluid that has no fixed path. This floating stage happens before the cancer cells attach to new organs. Scientists did not fully understand what happened during the floating period or how cells worked together to spread cancer so quickly.\n\nThe research team discovered that cancer cells recruit protective mesothelial cells that have shed from the abdominal cavity lining during this floating stage. The two cell types stick together and form hybrid spheres. The mesothelial cells then grow invadopodia, spike-like structures that drill into surrounding tissue. The hybrid spheres resist chemotherapy drugs more effectively and invade tissues faster when they land on organs.\n\nOutsourcing the hard work of cell invasion\n\nThe researchers examined abdominal fluid from ovarian cancer patients using advanced microscopy to watch this process in real time. They confirmed their findings with mouse models and single-cell genetic analysis.\n\nLead author Dr. Kaname Uno, a former PhD student and current Visiting Researcher at Nagoya University's Graduate School of Medicine, explained that the cancer cells do not need to become more invasive themselves. \"They manipulate mesothelial cells to do the tissue invasion work. They undergo minimal genetic and molecular changes and just migrate through the openings that mesothelial cells create.\"\n\nDr. Uno worked as a gynecologist for eight years before he pursued research. One of his patients changed his career path. She had clear screening results just three months before doctors found advanced ovarian cancer. Current medical tools failed to detect the cancer early enough to save her life. This motivated Dr. Uno to investigate why ovarian cancer spreads so rapidly.\n\nThis discovery opens new treatment possibilities. Current chemotherapy targets cancer cells but ignores the mesothelial accomplices. Future drugs could block the TGF-β1 signal or prevent the formation of these dangerous partnerships. The research also suggests that doctors could monitor these cell clusters in abdominal fluid to predict disease progression and treatment response.",

      "content": "Scientists have pinpointed a group of bacteria that consistently appear in high numbers in healthy people, suggesting that these could one day be targeted through diet or probiotics\n\nGut bacteria that we barely know anything about may be essential for good health 3DMEDISPHERE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n\nA mysterious group of bacteria seems to thrive in the gut microbiomes of people without illness, hinting that they may be crucial to good health.\n\nMore than 4600 species of bacteria are estimated to reside in our gut, interacting with each other and our bodies to influence everything from our immune system to our sleep, rate of ageing and risk of mental health conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet about two-thirds of these species are part of the “hidden microbiome”, most of which we haven’t managed to grow in a lab or even name. We only know they exist after spotting their genomes in the gut. “A burning question still remains: are these species just bystanders or relevant to human health?” says Alexandre Almeida at the University of Cambridge.\n\nTo get an idea, Almeida and his colleagues searched for the genetic fingerprints of bacteria in the array of genomes found in gut microbiome samples. These were taken from studies that involved more than 11,000 people from 39 countries, primarily in Europe, North America and Asia.\n\nAbout half of these people had no known medical condition, while the other half had been diagnosed with one of 13 conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThe researchers linked 715 bacterial species to at least one of these conditions, of which 342 species were found in higher numbers when people had a condition and 373 were more numerous when people had a clean bill of health.\n\nAmong these candidates, a genus called CAG-170 emerged with the strongest link. “Consistently across different conditions, we found that CAG-170 seem to be markedly increased in health compared to disease,” says Almeida.\n\nIn another part of the study, Almeida and his colleagues investigated which bacterial species were most associated with a healthy mix of gut microbes or an unbalanced one, known as dysbiosis.\n\n“We found that, again, CAG-170 seem to be having a pronounced effect,” says Almeida. “There was a clear correlation where, essentially, higher abundance of CAG-170 was associated with lower dysbiosis and a healthier gut microbiome.”\n\nTo investigate why this might be, the team then looked into CAG-170 genomes, discovering genes for metabolic pathways that can produce high levels of vitamin B12, and for enzymes that break down a range of carbohydrates and fibres.\n\nThere was no sign that CAG-170 bacteria use vitamin B12 themselves, but other species usually found alongside them often have the capacity to utilise it, says Almeida. “It seems like CAG-170 are taking more of an altruistic approach and providing metabolic support to the rest of the microbiome.”\n\nThis is an important step towards better understanding which features of our gut microbiome are associated with health or illness, says Nicola Segata at the University of Trento in Italy, whose work recently revealed what a healthy gut microbiome may look like, but didn’t specifically outline the mechanisms by which such bacteria may bring about these benefits.\n\nWhether high numbers of CAG-170 cause good health or are a consequence of it isn’t easy to answer, says Almeida. Working that out will require studies that investigate whether introducing CAG-170 reduces the risk of certain conditions.\n\n“The human microbiome and the human body are so tightly connected that they should be regarded as a single, extremely complex system,” says Segata. “Rather than discussing the causal role of the first with respect to the second, we should investigate how the overall system is linked to healthy or unhealthy states and to healthy and unhealthy diets.”\n\nSegata says it is important to follow up this research with nutritional clinical trials to assess which changes in diet affect which parts of the microbiome-human system.\n\nAlmeida sees the potential of CAG-170 in two ways. The first is that these bacteria could be used as an indicator of gut microbiome health. The second is by opening the door to a new generation of probiotics designed to support overall health.\n\nCAG-170 could be a good candidate for probiotics, says Segata, but it is very challenging to grow these bacteria in the lab, let alone develop methods to deliver them alive into the gut and then actually colonise it. “Finding the best food or the best prebiotic supplement able to increase the amounts of CAG-170 is likely something more at hand than the development of those species as a probiotic product,” he says.\n\nBut the genomic data offers a clue about what might help, says Almeida. CAG-170 bacteria seem unable to produce the amino acid arginine, so providing more of that may help culture the bacteria, or one day boost their presence in the gut.",
