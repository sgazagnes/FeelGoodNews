      "summary": "Life’s story may stretch further back than scientists once thought. Some genes found in nearly every organism today were already duplicated before all life shared a common ancestor. By tracking these rare genes, researchers can investigate how early cells worked and what features of life emerged first. New computational tools are now helping scientists unlock this hidden chapter of evolution.",
      "content": "Every organism alive today traces its lineage back to a single shared ancestor that lived about four billion years ago. Scientists refer to this organism as the \"last universal common ancestor,\" and it represents the earliest form of life that can currently be examined using established evolutionary methods.\n\nResearch on this ancient ancestor shows that many features seen in modern life were already in place at that time. Cells already had membranes, and genetic information was stored in DNA. Because these essential traits were already established, scientists seeking to understand how life first took shape must look even further back in time, to evolutionary events that occurred before this shared ancestor existed.\n\nStudying Life Before the First Common Ancestor\n\nIn a study published in the journal Cell Genomics, researchers Aaron Goldman (Oberlin College), Greg Fournier (MIT), and Betül Kaçar (University of Wisconsin-Madison) describe a way to explore that earlier period of evolution. \"While the last universal common ancestor is the most ancient organism we can study with evolutionary methods,\" said Goldman, \"some of the genes in its genome were much older.\" The team focuses on a special group of genes called \"universal paralogs,\" which preserve evidence of biological changes that took place before the last universal common ancestor.\n\nA paralog is a group of related genes that appear multiple times within a single genome. Humans provide a clear example. Our DNA contains eight different hemoglobin genes, all of which produce proteins that carry oxygen through the blood. These genes all originated from a single ancestral globin gene that existed around 800 million years ago. Over long periods of time, repeated copying errors produced extra versions of the gene, and each copy gradually developed its own specialized role.\n\nWhat Makes Universal Paralogs Unique\n\nUniversal paralogs are much rarer. These gene families appear in at least two copies in the genomes of nearly all living organisms. Their widespread presence suggests that the original gene duplication occurred before the last universal common ancestor emerged. Those duplicated genes were then passed down through countless generations and remain present in life today.\n\nBecause of this deep evolutionary reach, the authors argue that universal paralogs are a critical yet often overlooked resource for studying the earliest history of life on Earth. This approach is becoming more practical as new AI-based techniques and AI-optimized hardware make it easier to analyze ancient genetic patterns in detail.\n\n\"While there are precious few universal paralogs that we know,\" says Goldman, \"they can give us a lot of information about what life was like before the time of the last universal common ancestor.\" Fournier adds, \"The history of these universal paralogs is the only information we will ever have about these earliest cellular lineages, and so we need to carefully extract as much knowledge as we can from them.\"\n\nClues to the First Cellular Functions\n\nIn their analysis, Goldman, Fournier, and Kaçar reviewed all known universal paralogs. Every one of these genes plays a role in either building proteins or moving molecules across cell membranes. This finding suggests that protein production and membrane transport were among the first biological functions to evolve.\n\nThe researchers also emphasize the importance of reconstructing the ancient forms of these genes. In one study from Goldman's lab at Oberlin, scientists examined a universal paralog family involved in inserting enzymes and other proteins into cell membranes. Using standard methods from evolutionary biology and computational biology, they reconstructed the protein produced by the original ancestral gene.\n\nTheir results showed that this simpler, ancient protein could still attach to cell membranes and interact with the machinery that makes proteins. It likely helped early proteins embed themselves into primitive membranes, offering insight into how the earliest cells may have operated.\n\nA New Window Into Life's Earliest History\n\nThe authors hope that continued advances in computational tools will allow scientists to identify additional universal paralog families and study their ancient ancestors in greater detail. \"By following universal paralogs,\" says Kaçar, \"we can connect the earliest steps of life on Earth to the tools of modern science. They provide us a chance to transform the deepest unknowns of evolution and biology into discoveries we can actually test.\" Their goal is to build a clearer picture of evolution before the last universal common ancestor, shedding light on how life as we know it first emerged.",

      "title": "Physicists discover what controls the speed of quantum time",
      "summary": "Time may feel smooth and continuous, but at the quantum level it behaves very differently. Physicists have now found a way to measure how long ultrafast quantum events actually last, without relying on any external clock. By tracking subtle changes in electrons as they absorb light and escape a material, researchers discovered that these transitions are not instantaneous and that their duration depends strongly on the atomic structure of the material involved.",
      "content": "\"The concept of time has troubled philosophers and physicists for thousands of years, and the advent of quantum mechanics has not simplified the problem,\" says Professor Hugo Dil, a physicist at EPFL. \"The central problem is the general role of time in quantum mechanics, and especially the timescale associated with a quantum transition.\"\n\nAt the smallest scales, physical processes unfold at astonishing speeds. Events such as tunneling or an electron shifting to a new energy state after absorbing light can happen in just a few tens of attoseconds (10-18 seconds). That interval is so brief that even light would not travel across the width of a small virus during that time.\n\nWhy Measuring Quantum Time Is So Difficult\n\nTracking such tiny slices of time has proven extremely challenging. Any external timing device risks interfering with the fragile quantum process being studied and changing its behavior. \"Although the 2023 Nobel prize in physics shows we can access such short times, the use of such an external time scale risks to induce artifacts,\" Dil says. \"This challenge can be resolved by using quantum interference methods, based on the link between accumulated phase and time.\"\n\nA New Way to Measure Time Without a Clock\n\nDil and his team have now developed a method that avoids external clocks altogether. When electrons absorb a photon and are emitted from a material, they carry information encoded in their spin. That spin changes depending on how the quantum transition unfolds. By carefully analyzing these changes, the researchers were able to determine how long the transition lasts.\n\nAs first author of the study Fei Guo explains, \"These experiments do not require an external reference, or clock, and yield the time scale required for the wavefunction of the electron to evolve from an initial to a final state at a higher energy upon photon absorption.\"\n\nHow Quantum Interference Reveals Duration\n\nWhen light excites an electron, the process does not follow a single path. Multiple quantum pathways are possible at the same time, and they interfere with one another. This interference leaves a clear signature in the spin of the emitted electron. By examining how this spin pattern changes as the electron's energy varies, the team could calculate how long the transition took.\n\nTo carry out these measurements, the researchers used a method known as \"spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\" (SARPES). In this technique, intense synchrotron light strikes a material, boosting its electrons to higher energy and forcing them to escape the material's structure. Scientists then measure the energy, direction, and spin of the emitted electrons.\n\nHow Atomic Structure Affects Quantum Timing\n\nThe team tested materials with very different atomic arrangements. Some were fully three dimensional, such as ordinary copper. Others, including titanium diselenide (TiSe₂) and titanium ditelluride (TiTe₂), are made of weakly connected layers that behave more like flat sheets. Copper telluride (CuTe) has an even simpler, chain-like atomic structure. These contrasts made the materials ideal for studying how geometry influences timing.\n\nThe results revealed a consistent pattern. The simpler and more reduced the atomic structure of a material, the longer the quantum transition lasted. In three dimensional copper, the transition was extremely fast, taking about 26 attoseconds.\n\nIn the layered materials TiSe₂ and TiTe₂, the same process slowed to between 140 and 175 attoseconds. In CuTe, with its chain-like structure, the transition exceeded 200 attoseconds. These findings show that the atomic scale shape of a material strongly affects how quickly a quantum event unfolds, with lower symmetry structures leading to longer transition times.\n\nWhat This Means for Understanding Quantum Time\n\n\"Besides yielding fundamental information for understanding what determines the time delay in photoemission, our experimental results provide further insight into what factors influence time on the quantum level, to what extent quantum transitions can be considered instantaneous, and might pave the way to finally understand the role of time in quantum mechanics,\" Dil explains.\n\nBeyond deepening our understanding of time in quantum physics, the work offers a new tool for studying how electrons behave in complex materials. Knowing how long a quantum transition lasts could help scientists design materials with tailored quantum properties and support future technologies that depend on precise control of quantum states.\n\nOther contributors",

      "content": "The lines worn into an engraved limestone object from the Netherlands are consistent with the idea that it was a Roman game board, according to an AI analysis\n\nThe possible game board with pencil marks highlighting the incised lines Het Romeins Museum\n\nA mysterious flat stone with a geometric pattern of straight lines carved into it may be a previously unknown Roman board game.\n\nThousands of simulations by artificial intelligence of how sliding stone or glass pieces could have marked the surface suggest it was an early example of a blocking game, a type not documented in Europe until several centuries later in the Middle Ages.\n\nWritings and physical remains have revealed that the Romans played many board games. These include Ludus latrunculorum, or the game of soldiers, where the goal is to capture the other player’s pieces; Ludus duodecim scriptorum, which means the game of 12 signs and is often thought of as an ancestor of backgammon; and games like tic-tac-toe, or noughts and crosses, where you win by placing three symbols in a line on a grid.\n\nHowever, there are likely to be many games we don’t know about because nothing was written about them, no traces have survived or we just don’t recognise them for what they are.\n\nIn the Roman Museum in Heerlen, the Netherlands, Walter Crist at Leiden University, also in the Netherlands, came across a flat stone measuring 212 by 145 millimetres with a geometric pattern carved on its upper face. It was found at the Roman town of Coriovallum, which is buried under present-day Heerlen, and the type of limestone it is made of was often imported from France for use in decorative elements on buildings between AD 250 and 476.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“I was a bit sceptical at first because it’s a pattern I had not seen before, so I asked the museum to have a closer look,” says Crist. He then found visible wear on the object’s surface consistent with if you were pushing stone game pieces along the carved lines.\n\nThe wear was uneven, though, with most of it on one particular diagonal line.\n\nTo see what could have led to this distinctive pattern, Crist and his colleagues used an AI play system known as Ludii, which pitted two AI agents against each other. It simulated thousands of games with different numbers of starting pieces and 130 rule variations from various ancient board games that have been played in Europe, including haretavl from Scandinavia and gioco dell’orso from Italy.\n\nReconstruction of one of the main roads in the city centre of Coriovallum Mikko Kriek/BCL Archaeological Support Amsterdam\n\nThe results revealed that nine similar blocking games, in which the person with more pieces tries to block their opponent from moving, could have led to the distinctive wear, says Crist.\n\nThe team is tentatively calling the game Ludus Coriovalli, or the game from Coriovallum.\n\n“I’m not convinced we can ever know for sure, but the analysis shows that this object certainly could be a game board,” says Tim Penn at the University of Reading, UK.\n\n“It’s an interesting approach,” says Ulrich Schädler at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. But he’s not convinced the object is a game board, because the geometric pattern seems imprecise and this is the only known instance of this pattern, when normally many versions of game boards are found.\n\nCrist accepts that we may never know, but says it may have been a prototype game, or one that was normally played using marks scratched in the earth so no traces remain.\n\nBlocking games in Europe are documented from the Middle Ages onwards, so if Ludus Coriovalli is a blocking game, it pushes the evidence back several centuries for people playing these games there. They may have existed earlier in South and East Asia, says Crist, and there seem to be some blocking-game-like patterns in Roman-era graffiti, but it is difficult to date those.\n\nCombining archaeological and AI methods like this could provide glimpses of other mysterious ancient games, says Penn. Another possible game board, from the Roman legionary camp at Vindonissa in Switzerland, features markings that look like a square with an X inside it, with little holes where lines meet. “Maybe this kind of analysis could help cast new light on it,” says Penn.",
