      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 30 July 2025; doi:10.1038/s41586-025-09317-zThe discovery of chemosynthesis-based benthic communities at depths of 5,800 m to 9,533 m in the Kuril–Kamchatka and western Aleutian trenches challenges traditional perspectives on the energy sources sustaining hadal fauna.",
      "content": "The investigation was carried out during TS42 cruise between 7 July and 18 August 2024 by RV Tan Suo Yi Hao with the full-ocean-depth human-occupied vehicle Fendouzhe, which was fitted with hydraulically powered manipulators on two swing arms. Under the guidance of operators in the human-occupied vehicle, the arms efficiently acquired the samples and stored them safely in a biological box and a geological box of the vehicle.\n\nProcessing of benthic fauna and sea floor video footage\n\nUpon retrieval of the submersible, all collected specimens were promptly transferred from the biological collection box and slurp sampler to the shipboard laboratory. The specimens were then sorted into main taxonomic groups of different levels using visual inspection or under stereomicroscopes. Each organism was counted and preserved in pre-cooled, non-denatured 95% ethanol or in a 4% buffered formaldehyde solution depending on the taxon. Following initial preservation, certain taxonomic groups were further transferred to 70% ethanol for long-term storage.\n\nVisual assessment of species identification, density and spatial structure of the macro-epifauna and mega-epifauna of the seep communities was carried out on the basis of the analysis of video footage recorded by two high-definition cameras mounted on the human-occupied vehicle. For each dive, between three and ten representative screenshots showing the densest cold-seep communities were selected from the video footage. The area of each image was estimated using the submersible’s laser scale, which projects two parallel laser points 10 cm apart onto the sea floor. This provided a reliable spatial reference for calculating the area of the sea floor captured in each image. A standardized quadrat (for example, 50 × 50 cm) was drawn near the laser dots by using this laser scale as a reference in the image. The calculated area was then converted into square metres for standardized density calculations. Animals visible in each quadrat were manually counted, and faunal density was expressed as the number of individuals per square metre. For each dive, density values from the selected images were used to calculate the mean faunal density, and the standard deviation was computed to quantify the variability among replicate images.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses of the coxI gene sequences\n\nUp to 0.5 cm3 of fauna tissue was cut into tiny pieces and subjected to DNA extraction using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories). The extracted DNA was quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit with Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). A metagenomic library was constructed using the VAHTS Universal DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina v.4 and sequenced on the NovaSeq X Plus platform (Illumina) to generate 2 × 150 bp pair-ended reads. Raw sequencing reads were qualified using Fastp v.0.23.2 and assembly into contigs using MEGAHIT v.1.2.9. The coxI gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I of the fauna was retrieved from metagenomic contigs. The retrieved coxI was searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database for preliminary taxonomy identification.\n\nGas and pore-water sampling\n\nDuring each dive, 6–12 sediment pushcores were collected using the manipulators of the submersible. Upon recovery, these pushcores were immediately transported to the ship’s cold room, which is kept at around 4 °C, to facilitate subsequent processing. Among them, one or two pushcores were allocated for gas concentration analysis onboard, with only subsamples exhibiting high methane concentrations being prepared for further carbon and deuterium isotope analysis. In addition, one or two pushcores were used to extract pore water samples for geochemical analysis.\n\nPore-water sampling was conducted using Rhizon samplers (as described in ref. 51). These samplers were inserted into the cores at 2-cm intervals and connected to 50-ml evacuated disposable syringes fitted with three-way Luer-lock stopcocks. The first approximately 1 ml of extracted pore water was discarded to remove any contaminants. Subsequently, around 15 ml of pore water was collected within a 2-h time frame. One portion of the pore water was preserved with a 20% zinc acetate solution for subsequent hydrogen sulfide analysis. The remaining pore water samples were transferred to 15-ml centrifuge tubes and frozen for subsequent ion analysis.\n\nFor the analysis of gas composition and isotopes, sediment samples were collected using a 2.5-ml cutoff plastic syringe, which was inserted through pre-drilled holes in the pushcore tube at depth intervals of 4 cm. A 2.5-ml sediment sample was then transferred to a 20-ml gas-tight glass vial, which was filled with 2 M NaOH solution and sealed with a crimp cap containing butyl rubber stoppers. The vials were vigorously shaken and stored in an upside-down position at 4 °C until analysis, which was conducted onboard in a single day. Before analysis, the vials were shaken again, and 2 ml of the NaOH solution was replaced with helium gas to create a headspace. The headspace gas from the push core was also directly extracted using a 20-ml syringe equipped with a three-way stopcock and was immediately transferred to a 12-ml vacuum Labco vial for further analysis.\n\nGas concentration and isotope\n\nThe concentration of dissolved gases was determined using a gas chromatograph (Trace GC1310; Thermo Scientific) installed onboard the research vessel. Headspace volumes ranging from 100 to 500 μl were sampled and injected into a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. The analytical precision achieved in these measurements is consistently lower than 5%.\n\nThe δ13C and δD isotopic compositions of methane were analysed using a gas chromatography–isotope ratio mass spectrometer system, which consisted of a Trace GC1310 connected to a Delta V Advantage Isotope Ratio MS (Thermo Scientific). The analysis was conducted at the Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering (IDSSE), Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nMethane was selectively separated from the gas matrix using a gas chromatography column (27 m × 0.3 mm × 20.00 μm; PoraPLOT Q). The separated methane was then combusted in a combustion oven at a temperature of 1,000 °C, which was interfaced with the isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) for subsequent analysis. The resulting CO 2 was directly introduced into the IRMS for measurement.\n\nThe precision of the repeated analyses, expressed as the standard deviation (1σ), was ±0.5‰ for δ13C and ±2‰ for δD. The isotopic compositions of individual carbon compounds were reported as δ-values (‰) relative to the international standards Vienna Peedee Belemnite (VPDB) for δ13C and Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) for δD.\n\nPore-water geochemistry\n\nHydrogen sulfide concentrations were determined colorimetrically using the methylene blue method (with a limit of detection of approximately 0.5 μM). The concentration of \\({{\\rm{SO}}}_{4}^{2-}\\) in pore water was quantified by ion chromatography using a Dionex ICS-900 system, which was equipped with an AS50 AutoSampler. To ensure that the \\({{\\rm{SO}}}_{4}^{2-}\\) concentrations fell in the optimal analytical range for the ion chromatograph, the anion samples were diluted 70-fold with Milli-Q water. The analytical precision for the determination of \\({{\\rm{SO}}}_{4}^{2-}\\) was ±3.0%. \\({{\\rm{NH}}}_{4}^{+}\\) concentrations were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (LS55, PE) following the procedure reported in ref. 52, with a relative deviation of 0.5%. DIC concentrations and δ13C-DIC values were analysed using a Gas Bench II IRMS at IDSSE. The samples were pretreated with an acid solution on the Gas Bench II; the resulting carbon dioxide, carried by helium, was separated by a constant-temperature chromatographic column and subsequently analysed for isotope abundance using a MAT253 gas stable IRMS. The analytical precision for DIC was ±0.15% and that for δ13C-DIC was ±0.5‰. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations were measured by a high-temperature catalytic oxidation method using a Multi N/C 3100 (CLD) analyser at IDSSE. Samples were thawed at room temperature and acidified to pH 2 with 2 mol l−1 hydrochloric acid before injection. Salinity was measured in the laboratory using a handheld digital salinity meter (ATAGO PAL-SALT) after the samples were thawed to room temperature.\n\nMethane phase modelling\n\nThe phase boundaries and methane hydrate solubility in the methane hydrate–sea water system were calculated using thermodynamic models53,54. The chemical potential of the hydrate phase was determined through the application of the Van der Waals–Platteeuw hydrate model, in conjunction with angle-dependent ab initio intermolecular potentials, as previously described in ref. 55. The Gibbs–Thomson equation, incorporating appropriately parameterized hydrate–water interface values, was used to account for the capillary effects of porous sediments on the hydrate–liquid–vapour equilibrium and the hydrate–liquid equilibrium. The influence of surface textures and mineral components was neglected in this analysis.\n\nThe activity coefficients for water and methane in the methane–sea water system were calculated using the Pitzer model. By applying the Poynting correction to the fugacity of methane dissolved in aqueous solution at the hydrate–liquid equilibrium, where methane gas is absent, the extended model for three-phase equilibrium was adapted to predict the solubility of methane in aqueous solution at the hydrate–liquid equilibrium.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long studied deep-sea ecosystems, but life at the greatest ocean depths, especially in hadal trenches (below 6,000 meters), remains poorly understood. Traditionally, it was believed that these extreme zones rely mostly on organic matter falling from upper layers for energy.\n\n**What happened** – During a 2024 research cruise aboard the RV Tan Suo Yi Hao, researchers used the human-occupied submersible Fendouzhe to explore the Kuril–Kamchatka and western Aleutian trenches at depths between 5,800 and 9,533 meters. They discovered benthic communities sustained by chemosynthesis—organisms that produce energy by converting chemicals rather than relying on sunlight—thriving on the seafloor.\n\n**Impact** – This finding challenges previous assumptions that hadal fauna depend mainly on surface-derived organic material. Chemosynthetic life at such extreme depths reveals a more complex and self-sustaining ecosystem than previously known. The discovery expands our understanding of deep-sea biodiversity and the adaptability of life under harsh conditions.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to continue exploring hadal ecosystems to map and study these chemosynthetic communities in more detail.

      "summary": "While pets can impact the natural world, there are actions you can take to reduce...\nThe post Guest Idea: 12 High-Impact Changes To Reduce Your Pet’s Carbon Footprint appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "While pets can impact the natural world, there are actions you can take to reduce their carbon footprint when it comes to food, waste and products. Sustainable pet care is better for pets, wildlife and the planet.\n\nAccording to the American Pet Products Association, an estimated 71 percent of U.S. households, or approximately 94 million families, own a pet. Their collective environmental impact is substantial, ranging from the resources required to produce pet food to the plastic waste generated by toys and accessories. Many pet owners are unaware that simple changes to their daily routines can significantly reduce their furry companions’ ecological pawprint.\n\nDiscover 12 practical strategies spanning food choices, waste management, product selection, and everyday habits that will help you care for your pet while protecting the planet they—and we—call home.\n\nFeed Right\n\nChoose Sustainable Pet Food\n\nYour pet’s health starts with their diet. Sustainable pet food is also crucial to the planet’s well-being, encompassing green production, biodegradable packaging, and balanced nutrition.\n\nA 2022 study found that the carbon footprint of dry pet food could account for 2.9% of annual U.S. carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and uses 1.2% of agricultural land.\n\nPet owners can feed their animals premium, organic options that are grown and raised without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). For example, The Honest Kitchen requires suppliers to provide proof of origin for all ingredients, as well as non-GMO status and clean food handling practices. Vendors must also submit a Certificate of Analysis to demonstrate the absence of pathogens, while The Honest Kitchen conducts third-party testing for heavy metals, melamine, and ethoxyquin.\n\nAvoiding GMOs is crucial to protecting biodiversity, preventing the development of herbicide-resistant weeds, averting the spread of GMO genes to wild flora, and safeguarding beneficial insects that improve soil health.\n\nSustainable products comply with organic certification standards and aim to provide optimal, natural nutrition while supporting sustainable and ethical farming. Quality labels include Certified Regenerative by A Greener World, Land to Market, Regenerative Organic Certified, and Certified B Corporation.\n\nSome sustainable pet food brands include Open Farm, Wild Earth, The Farmer’s Dog, and Stella & Chewy’s, all of which ethically source and humanely raise their proteins.\n\nReduce Food Waste\n\nFeed your pet proper portion sizes and invest in storage solutions to save space, maintain freshness, and avoid spoilage. Composting your pet’s food scraps can create healthy soil for your garden and divert leftovers from landfills.\n\nYou can also make proper food storage and composting a habit to reduce your environmental impact. If composting at home isn’t feasible, your town may have a community-wide composting program you can participate in.\n\nManaging Pet Waste Responsibly\n\nThere is no way around pet waste, so you should manage its disposal responsibly. Whether you’re a cat or dog person, here’s how to handle the less glamorous part of animal ownership.\n\nDispose of Pet Waste\n\nUse biodegradable and compostable poop bags to maintain pristine surroundings and avoid contamination of nearby bodies of water with bacterial runoff. Throw the poop in the garbage — pet waste is not compostable in your backyard compost system. You can check whether your community has a pet poop compost or a municipal program for handling domestic animal waste.\n\nUse Alternative Cat Litter\n\nIf you have a picky cat, gradually introduce biodegradable litter by mixing it with the old brand and adding a bit more of the new one each day so they get used to the new scent and texture. You can identify biodegradable litter by checking the packaging and looking for materials made from paper, cardboard, plant-based products, and other natural fibers.\n\nAlso, opt for biodegradable bags when disposing of them. For example, beyondGREEN litter waste bags meet international standards for composting. Likewise, Metro Paws Cat Litter Bags leave no trace of microplastics when they break down.\n\nSustainable Pet Products\n\nSustainability should be at the top of your list when shopping for pet products. There could be some trade-offs, though. While many items have a reduced environmental impact, they may come in non-recyclable packaging. Do your best to consider the entire product life cycle, including the use of sustainable packaging. Look for certifications such as the Forest Stewardship Council or Global Organic Textile Standard, and prioritize goods with minimal or recyclable packaging. Here are a few key points to consider.\n\nClean With Sustainable Grooming and Care Products\n\nShampoos and similar products wash down the drain and may enter aquatic ecosystems. When grooming your pets, use safe, sustainable treatments and recycle plastic bottles whenever possible.\n\nDon’t think only in terms of your dog’s health — consider their impact on your home as well. Regular grooming and nail trimming also protect your home’s longevity, which means fewer resources to replace damaged items like carpets, furniture, and other materials that clutter landfills when discarded. For example, hardwood floors require refinishing every three to five years to protect against dog nails and may cost $4,500 to install. Pet owners can consider carpet runners or alternative, sustainable materials like cork flooring, getting their doggy-approved shoes for the home, and other preventive measures. This means less carbon footprint and fewer resources used.\n\nChoose Sustainable Bedding\n\nChoose bedding made from sustainable materials, such as organic cotton, hemp, bamboo, and other natural fillers. You can even make a comfy bed for your dog by upcycling old clothes or towels as stuffing. Studies show that organic cotton is less water- and energy-intensive than conventional cotton.\n\nBe mindful of your pet’s needs. Investing in a plush orthopedic bed is ideal for alleviating joint pain in larger or older dogs. You can use coconut fiber, hemp, or shredded newspaper for burrowing rodents and reptiles.\n\nBuy Sustainable Toys\n\nPet toys made from sustainable materials, such as rubber, hemp, organic cotton, and recycled plastics, are a beneficial upgrade for your pet’s health and the environment. Many of these toys are durable and last longer than others, which is practical for heavy chewers and prevents frequent replacement.\n\nHowever, the recycling of plastics also increases the risk that Fido will be exposed to microplastics, which negatively impact both wildlife and humans. Animal studies have shown that microplastics can spread to the liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lungs, brain, and reproductive organs. The microscopic fragments can alter critical biological processes.\n\nSustainable toys are often but not always free from harmful toxins, allowing you to prioritize your pet’s well-being. Try to choose products that balance long-lasting toughness and safety while minimizing environmental impact, recognizing some decisions might involve concessions in one area to benefit the other.\n\nThoughtful Pet Acquisition and Care\n\nResponsible pet acquisition and regular veterinary care can significantly benefit the natural environment and reduce the carbon footprint of dogs and cats.\n\nAdopt, Don’t Shop\n\nWhile your sights might be set on a purebred or specialty breed, adopting from a shelter can lower the environmental impact of pets. You reduce the demand for breeding new animals, lowering resource consumption and emissions, and you eliminate support for cruel breeding practices and facilities, which in turn decreases the homeless pet population.\n\nSpay and Neuter\n\nDomestic cats are among the world’s 100 worst invasive species, responsible for 14% of global bird, mammal, and reptile extinctions. Spaying and neutering your pet is crucial for controlling the population. This results in fewer strays, less overcrowding in animal shelters, reduced predation, and less spread of disease.\n\nStay Ahead of Veterinary Care\n\nTake your dog to the vet for routine check-ups or when they are sick, and ensure they receive complete vaccinations and up-to-date parasite prevention. Over 80% of domestic animal-borne pathogens, including canine rabies viruses, can spread to wildlife.\n\nSeveral online resources — such as Climate Pets and Vet Sustain — offer information about sustainable pet healthcare. Likewise, the veterinarian-hosted Our Pet’s Health podcast is an excellent resource for healthier pet parenting.\n\n“Pets and the Planet: A Practical Guide to Pet Care” by Carol Frischmann helps you make sustainable decisions for your pet, from buying food and toys to proper waste disposal.\n\nDaily Habits for Eco-Conscious Pet Owners\n\nYour daily water consumption and heating and cooling habits might change when you have a pet. Here is how you can adapt as a responsible and eco-conscious pet owner.\n\nReduce Energy Use\n\nThe American Kennel Club states that a dog’s body temperature averages 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. However, they may be slightly lower in smaller dogs. Because they tend to run warm, dogs are highly susceptible to overheating. Your pet might not be able to tolerate a big change, but you could reset your thermostat by 10 degrees, along with making some other minor changes to reduce your energy use.\n\nConsider lowering the thermostat more significantly when you and your pet are away from home. You could also switch to cold water for washing pet bedding, as heating water requires high amounts of energy, and cold water cleans just as efficiently. If you have a reptile or another pet that requires energy-intensive equipment, such as a heat lamp, try unplugging your other electronics when not in use to reduce your household’s overall energy consumption.\n\nConserve Water\n\nConserving water while grooming can lower your pet’s carbon footprint. Install a pet shower sprayer with a shut off nozzle in a large sink or bathtub to control water flow when lathering your pet. You can also bathe pets in an area of your lawn that needs watering or use a large bucket or basin. Many pet stores carry animal-safe dry shampoos that let you reduce the pollution created by your pets’ cleaning needs between grooming appointments.\n\nLove Your Pet in a Sustainable Way\n\nResponsible pet owners can care for their beloved animals and the environment simultaneously. By making minor changes to your routine and habits, you can reduce the environmental impact of your dog, cat, even your iguana.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRose Morrison is the managing editor of Renovated Magazine.
