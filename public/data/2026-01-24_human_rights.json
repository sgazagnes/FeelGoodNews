      "summary": "\"For me, cultural continuity is both a responsibility and a source of strength. It reminds me of why this work matters and who it is ultimately for.\"",
      "content": "Tekan Cochrane is an Australian Indigenous lawyer with Kooma, Yuwaalaraay and Torres Strait Islander heritage, as well as diverse European heritage. Raised on a farm in central Queensland, away from major population centres, and the first in her family to attend university, Tekan’s work is grounded in lived experience, community accountability, and a deep commitment to justice and systemic reform.\n\nIn 2025, Tekan was a finalist for the Australian Human Rights Commission’s Law Award, selected from more than 100 national nominations and recognised for her work supporting First Nations peoples and individuals in disadvantaged and marginalised communities.\n\nTekan is the Executive Officer of Tarwirri Indigenous Law Association of Victoria, a not-for-profit membership organisation representing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal professionals, graduates and students. Tarwirri is funded through the Victorian Aboriginal Justice Agreement due to the strong need for more Indigenous lawyers in Australia.\n\nTekan is also the founder of TC Law & Consulting, a member of the Law Council of Australia’s Indigenous Legal Issues Committee, the Chair of the Law Institute of Victoria’s Reconciliation Advancement Committee and was formerly a Non-Executive Director of Women of Colour Australia.\n\nPreviously, Tekan played a key role in the creation and management of the Victorian Stolen Generations Reparations Package, which acknowledges and addresses the trauma and harm caused by the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families, culture and Country. Her work continues to focus on First Nations justice, truth-telling, and structural reform across legal, policy and governance systems.\n\nTekan recently completed a Master’s in international relations, completing her dissertation on Indigenous peoples at a global level with a comparative study on Australia and Colombia.\n\nOn January 18, 2026, Global Voices’ author Kevin Rennie interviewed Tekan about her work for First Nations justice.\n\nKevin Rennie (KR): Given the tough-on-crime policies of Australian state governments, what can be done to reverse the growing trend of incarceration of Indigenous people in Australia, especially youth?\n\nTekan Cochrane (TC): In my view, the over-incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is not a failure of individuals but a failure of systems. The ‘Tough on crime’ policies disproportionately criminalise poverty, trauma, disability and racialised policing, particularly for our young people. Reversing this ‘trend’ requires a decisive shift away from punitive approaches and toward prevention, properly resourced community-led diversion programs, culturally safe youth services, justice reinvestment, and genuine accountability for police and child protection agencies. Most importantly, solutions must be designed and led by First Nations communities themselves. However, we need governments fully on board.\n\nKR: We are living through a new “stolen” generation with many Indigenous children being forcibly removed from their families. What action can we take to stem this shocking trend?\n\nTC: The fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children continue to be removed at alarming rates should shame the nation. Despite decades of inquiries and apologies, we are repeating the same harms under different names. To sum this up, governments must invest in early family support, housing stability, and culturally appropriate child and family services, not crisis-driven removals. The evidence is clear, when communities are trusted and resourced to care for their own children, outcomes improve dramatically.\n\nKR: The Victorian Aboriginal Justice Agreement has been around for nearly 20 years. What positive impact has it made on legal processes and outcomes for Aboriginal people?\n\nTC: The Victorian Aboriginal Justice Agreement has demonstrated that sustained partnership between government and Aboriginal communities can lead to real, measurable change. It has improved cultural safety in courts, increased Aboriginal participation in justice decision-making, and reduced some contact points with the criminal justice system. While gaps remain — particularly in incarceration rates — the Agreement shows that long-term, relationship-based reform is far more effective than short political cycles or punitive policy shifts.\n\nKR: In 2025, Victoria became the first State government to legislate a treaty with its First Nations peoples. How can it make a real difference for the lives of Indigenous peoples?\n\nTC: Victoria’s decision to legislate a Treaty framework is historic, but in reality, its value will be measured by outcomes, not symbolism. Treaty has the potential to transform power relations by embedding self-determination, truth-telling and accountability into the fabric of the State. If implemented properly, Treaty can address structural inequities in areas such as land, health, education and justice and, critically, it can provide a mechanism for First Nations peoples to negotiate directly over matters that affect our lives. I personally have a very positive outlook on Treaty in Victoria.\n\nKR: Following the 2023 failure of the constitutional referendum to enshrine an Indigenous Voice to the Federal Parliament, how can we get national reconciliation back on track?\n\nTC: The failure of the referendum was painful, but it should not be mistaken for a rejection of justice or truth. Reconciliation cannot be contingent on a single vote. It must continue through State and Territory processes, Treaty, truth-telling, and legislative reform. National reconciliation will only move forward when governments stop seeking permission to do the right thing and instead act consistently with human rights standards and the wishes of First Nations peoples themselves.\n\nKR: What has been your involvement with the Women of Colour Australia organisation?\n\nTC: My involvement with Women of Colour Australia has centered on amplifying the voices of women who sit at the intersections of race, gender and structural disadvantage. WoCA provides an important platform for advocacy, solidarity and leadership, particularly for women who are often marginalised within mainstream policy and professional spaces. That work aligns closely with my broader commitment to justice, equity and collective care.\n\nKR: With your busy professional life, how do you manage to maintain links to your Indigenous Country and culture?\n\nTC: Connection to Country and culture is not something I “fit in” around my work, it is what sustains it. Staying grounded in community, listening to Elders, honouring cultural obligations, and making time for reflection are essential acts of resistance in systems that often demand disconnection. For me, cultural continuity is both a responsibility and a source of strength. It reminds me of why this work matters and who it is ultimately for.\n\nKR: Finally, what advice do you have for young Indigenous people thinking of a career in the law?",

      "content": "“At a time of tensions both globally and regionally, it is in everyone’s interest to secure lasting peace and security in Colombia,” said Miroslav Jenča, delivering his quarterly briefing.\n\nHe said the coming year “undoubtedly provides a window to advance peace as a strategic national objective, and for Colombia and its partners to engage constructively through dialogue to address shared challenges,” particularly in the border area with Venezuela “where cooperation on all sides is essential.”\n\nTweet URL\n\nSwitch in focus\n\nMr. Jenča also heads the UN Verification Mission in Colombia, and he reported on re-organization outlined in Council resolution 2798 (2025), adopted last October.\n\nThe resolution extended the Mission’s mandate for a year and changed its focus to monitoring three provisions of the 2016 peace agreement signed by the Government and FARC-EP rebels:\n\nComprehensive rural reform\n\nReintegration of former combatants\n\nSecurity of both ex-fighters and communities in conflict-affected regions\n\nPreviously mandated verification on transitional justice, ethnic-related issues and ceasefire monitoring was discontinued.\n\nChallenges in conflict areas\n\nMr. Jenča has spent the past three months meeting key counterparts across Colombia who underscored that the three pillars are important for achieving peace.\n\nDuring visits to several parts of the country, he was “struck not only by the immense challenges facing communities in conflict-affected regions, but also by their resilience and determination to achieve a better future.”\n\nIn some of the most remote areas, daily life is a struggle “due to the actions of different illegal armed actors and to the limited presence of the state, public services and development opportunities.”\n\nLimited opportunities\n\nHe noted that re-integration of former combatants is essential to the success of peace agreements and ensuring their transition to civilian life is crucial to avoid a return to violence.\n\n“Nevertheless, nine years after the FARC-EP laid down arms under the Peace Agreement, the path has proven challenging for the over 11,000 former combatants who remain active in the government’s reintegration programme,” he said.\n\nThese men and women often live in remote areas with limited infrastructure, access to markets, and threats to their security.\n\n“For the authorities, it has also entailed major efforts, both financial and programmatic, to facilitate their transition into civilian life,” he added, noting that while substantial progress has been made but more is needed.\n\n‘Fertile ground’ for armed groups\n\nAccess to land has progressed in Colombia but still needs to be fully resolved, Mr. Jenča said. Meanwhile, security remains fragile.\n\nSome 487 former combatants have been killed since laying down their arms. He urged the authorities to step up investigations and prioritize security guarantees for those who signed the peace deal.\n\nAlthough violence is far lower now than at the height of the conflict, “the presence of armed groups in areas still affected by conflict continues to inflict suffering on entire communities.”\n\nThis violence is being fuelled by a mix of factors and limited State presence “provides fertile ground for the armed groups to exert control, and for illicit economies to prevail.”\n\nRise in child recruitment\n\nAs a result, civilian populations have faced threats, killings of social leaders, forced displacement and confinement, and an alarming increase in child recruitment and use by armed groups.\n\nThe situation in border areas is particularly complex, he said. The UN Mission’s team in Cúcuta, a city on the border with Venezuela, supports response to continuing clashes between rival armed groups.\n\nThousands of civilians have been have forced to flee their homes in the Catatumbo region, which he described as “a hub of coca cultivation and cross-border armed activities and criminality.”\n\n‘Holistic vision’ for peace\n\nMr. Jenča insisted that the Peace Agreement can significantly contribute to addressing many of these problems.\n\n“It offers a much-needed holistic vision, by providing for the strengthening of the State’s capacity to dismantle criminal structures, to promote alternatives to coca cultivation and concrete development measures through its comprehensive rural reform,” he said.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Colombia vivió más de 50 años de conflicto que terminó con un acuerdo de paz en 2016 entre el gobierno y el grupo rebelde FARC-EP. Desde entonces, el país trabaja para lograr una paz duradera, pero aún enfrenta desafíos, especialmente en zonas rurales y fronterizas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Miroslav Jenča, Representante Especial de la ONU y jefe de la Misión de Verificación en Colombia, dijo al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que el año 2024 es clave para avanzar en los esfuerzos de paz. La misión de la ONU cambió su enfoque a tres áreas principales: reforma rural, reintegración de excombatientes a la vida civil y mejorar la seguridad para excombatientes y comunidades en zonas de conflicto. Este cambio sigue una resolución de la ONU de octubre de 2023.\n\n**Impacto** – Este nuevo enfoque es importante porque aborda los problemas centrales que afectan la paz en Colombia hoy. Por ejemplo, más de 11,000 excombatientes aún intentan adaptarse a la vida pacífica, a menudo en lugares remotos con pocos servicios y amenazas constantes. La misión también destaca los peligros que representan los grupos armados que siguen causando violencia, reclutando niños y bloqueando el desarrollo. El acuerdo de paz ofrece un plan para mejorar las zonas rurales, reducir el cultivo ilegal de drogas y fortalecer el papel del gobierno, lo que puede ayudar a reducir la violencia y apoyar a las comunidades.\n\n**Próximo paso** – La misión de la ONU seguirá monitoreando estas tres áreas clave y apoyando los esfuerzos de Colombia para proteger a excombatientes y civiles. Las autoridades deben aumentar la seguridad e investigar ataques contra excombatientes y líderes sociales. La cooperación entre Colombia y Venezuela también es importante para controlar la violencia cerca de la frontera. Los avances en la reforma rural y los programas de reintegración serán esenciales para continuar construyendo la paz.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – La ONU destaca 2024 como un año crucial para que Colombia avance en la paz enfocándose en la reforma rural, la reintegración de excombatientes y la mejora de la seguridad en áreas afectadas por el conflicto.\n",
