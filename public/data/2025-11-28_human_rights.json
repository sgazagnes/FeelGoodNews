      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nWomen and youth empowerment through education\n\nWelcome to the final week of The Optimist Daily’s Annual Local Changemakers series, where we’ve spent five weeks celebrating bold, community-rooted leaders transforming lives across the globe. This week, we highlight changemakers elevating those who are too often overlooked through education, nourishment, and care. We close with two powerful stories of women whose hard work shows us that education is the greatest catalyst for generational change.\n\nWhether it’s Shirley Santana Herrera nurturing the next generation of Latin American youth leaders or Shereen Arent championing women’s empowerment through Sambhali U.S. and its work in India, these changemakers understand that confidence and opportunity begin with access.\n\nLet’s turn now to Latin America, where Shirley Santana Herrera’s Excelsior Academy is empowering thousands of young people to break cycles of poverty through digital education, leadership training, and access to global opportunities. From a childhood shaped by scarcity to a career defined by innovation and service, Shirley’s journey is a testament to how equity in education can unlock futures.\n\nFrom La Romana to Forbes 30 Under 30\n\nAt just 24 years old, Shirley Santana Herrera has already founded Excelsior Academy, launched a regional climate initiative, and earned a place on the 2025 Forbes 30 Under 30 list for her work in education and social impact. She’s also a global speaker, advocate, and digital creator whose educational content has reached more than five million people and generated over 20 million views across platforms.\n\nBut her drive isn’t fueled by accolades alone, but is shaped by lived experience. Growing up in La Romana, Dominican Republic, Shirley faced firsthand the barriers of an under-resourced education system. Rather than accept that reality, she used it as fuel. Those early challenges ignited a passion she’s carried ever since.\n\n“She herself comes from an impoverished background,” wrote Ghazaleh Samandari, who nominated Shirley as a Local Changemaker. “But she is the ideal model to show what determination and hard work can do.”\n\nExcelsior Academy has now trained thousands of Latin American students, offering culturally relevant online courses that prepare students for scholarship applications, global exchanges, and community leadership.\n\n“Shirley has a tireless energy and innovative spirit,” Ghazaleh added. “She has built a sustainable and growing movement to help young people all over the world lead better, more promising lives.”\n\nExcelsior Academy: Training youth to lead\n\nAt the heart of Shirley’s mission is Excelsior Academy, a digital platform offering leadership development, academic training, and life-changing mentorship for underserved and first-generation students across Latin America. Since its founding, Excelsior has directly served over 5,000 students from 15 countries, including the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia.\n\nBut Excelsior is more than a course provider. It’s an engine of upward mobility and generational hope.\n\nShirley shared with The Optimist Daily that the Academy boasts a 90 percent program completion rate, and participants are four times more likely to secure full-ride scholarships for higher education compared to peers outside the program. In just the last three years, Excelsior students have collectively earned at least $250,000 in national and international university scholarships.\n\nThe ripple effects continue far after graduation. A remarkable 95 percent of alumni go on to participate in community-driven, impact-focused extracurricular initiatives. Whether launching local youth programs or working in climate resilience, Excelsior graduates aren’t just improving their own lives.\n\nIt is clear that Shirley’s efforts are grounded in her belief in compound impact. Her work demonstrates that when you train a young person with leadership skills and give them access to opportunity, they don’t stop with personal success. They replicate that empowerment in their communities.\n\nAccessible, scalable, and grounded in real need\n\nExcelsior’s programs meet students where they are, which is often in rural or digitally underserved areas. Its flagship offering, the Gaceta de Oportunidades (Opportunities Gazette), is a free, weekly digital magazine that reaches 25,000 students and shares vetted academic, leadership, and scholarship opportunities tailored to Latin American youth. This thoughtful, inclusive design is informed by Shirely’s own lived experience, and is what sets Excelsior apart.\n\nA parallel mission: Voces de la Tierra\n\nWhile education is Shirley’s core passion, she understands its deep intersection with environmental and social justice. In addition to Excelsior, she also founded Voces de la Tierra (Voices of the Earth), a climate governance initiative that empowers youth to advocate for environmental resilience in vulnerable regions.\n\nBy amplifying youth voices in climate policy and organizing local training sessions, Voces de la Tierra bridges the gap between global environmental goals and grassroots action. It’s another example of Shirley’s belief in interdependence and her ability to connect seemingly separate issues through a single lens of empowerment.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nExcelsior Academy continues to evolve, but on top of that, Ghazaleh shared with The Optimist Daily that Shirley is currently developing a new initiative that will equip at-risk youth with the skills and access they need to attain higher levels of education and economic stability. Her focus remains on building scalable, adaptable solutions that can work across cultures and conditions.\n\nTo date, Shirley’s efforts have impacted over 30,000 people directly, but have certainly inspired millions more. Her grassroots leadership has attracted recognition from global institutions like the Kofi Annan Foundation and drawn partnerships that reflect the power of mission-driven trust.\n\nShe’s not just building a movement. She’s building futures.\n\nWant to support Excelsior Academy?\n\nVisit somosexcelsioracademy.com or follow Shirley’s work on social media to learn more.\n\nFind Shirley Santana Herrera’s personal accounts here:\n\nInstagram: @shirsantanaherrera\n\nLinkedIn: Shirley Santana Herrera\n\nAnd follow Excelsior Academy for the latest news!\n\nInstagram: @_excelsior_academy\n\nLinkedIn: Excelsior Academy\n\nTikTok: @excelsior.academy180",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nWomen and youth empowerment through education\n\nWelcome to the final week of The Optimist Daily’s Annual Local Changemakers series, where we’ve spent five weeks celebrating community-rooted leaders driving bold solutions across the globe. We close this year’s series with two extraordinary women who remind us that education is far more than a tool; it’s a lifeline.\n\nWhether it’s Shirley Santana Herrera nurturing the next generation of Latin American youth leaders or Shereen Arent championing women’s empowerment through Sambhali U.S. and its work in India, these changemakers understand that confidence and opportunity begin with access. Their stories span continents, but share a common thread: when education is paired with dignity, support, and vision, generational change takes root.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at how Sambhali Trust, with support from Shereen Arent and Sambhali U.S., is turning education into lasting empowerment for women and girls across Rajasthan.\n\nEmpowered to choose: Helping women and girls change their own lives\n\nIn a dusty village in Setrawa, Rajasthan, a woman named Meera once dreamed of being a teacher. However the difficult realities of life eclipsed this hope. Her own education had ended after just two years of elementary school. She was married at 21, raising three children and running a struggling family shop. Her dreams seemed out of reach—until a life-changing opportunity arrived in 2007. That year, Sambhali Trust opened its first empowerment and education center in her village, offering free education, vocational training, and support for Dalit women and children.\n\nThat year, Meera took a leap of faith that would change everything. She enrolled her children in the newly opened Sambhali Primary Education Center and began attending Sambhali’s Empowerment Center herself.\n\nDespite resistance from her father-in-law, Meera’s husband supported her choice. She fought for the right to learn, to work, and to envision a new future for her family.\n\nMeera also enrolled her young daughter Lalita in Sambhali’s programs, and in 2012, Lalita became one of the first girls to move to Jodhpur for Sambhali’s boarding home program. Today, she is thriving while studying science in college, working part-time with Sambhali, and mentoring the next generation of girls.\n\nMeera, now a trained English and math teacher at the same Primary Education Center where her journey began, recently reopened the family store with her husband. Her eldest son is pursuing a master’s degree in computer science in Italy. Her youngest son is also in college.\n\nA family transformed because one woman gathered the courage to say yes to a new path.\n\nOne grandmother’s vision: Jamali and the Bheel basti of Jaisalmer\n\nTwo hundred miles away in the border city of Jaisalmer, a similar story unfolded more recently in the Bheel basti, a community where access to electricity, clean water, and education remains limited. Jamali, a respected midwife and community elder, saw what was possible when Sambhali Trust arrived.\n\nShe encouraged her daughter-in-law Ganga to attend the nearby Empowerment Center, where Ganga developed advanced sewing and embroidery skills. With support from Sambhali, Ganga and her husband expanded their small shop into a thriving business. As trust in Sambhali grew, Jamali made an even bolder move: she led the push to send girls from their basti to Sambhali’s boarding homes in Jodhpur.\n\nShe started with those close to her heart, her own granddaughters. Samaira and Uma became pioneers for the community, inspiring 12 other families to follow suit. Her eldest granddaughter Latika stayed in Jaisalmer and studies at a private school through a Sambhali scholarship. She aspires to join the army while Samaira hopes to become a district collector.\n\nIn a basti where girls were once rarely educated, a new norm is taking root.\n\nListening, responding, and growing: Sambhali Trust and Sambhali U.S.\n\nThese are just two of the 80,000 stories made possible by Sambhali Trust since its founding in 2007. At the heart of the organization is a commitment to listening to the needs of Dalit women and girls, responding with care, and building solutions together.\n\nWhat began as a single Empowerment Center in Setrawa has grown into a network of interconnected programs: education centers, boarding homes, self-help groups, anti-violence services, health education, scholarships, and more. New locations like Jaisalmer were not chosen by strategic plan, but by invitation. During India’s severe COVID lockdowns, families in Jaisalmer heard via WhatsApp that Sambhali was distributing food and called them to come. Sambhali answered, and seeing the need, decided to stay.\n\nWhat makes this story even more powerful is the quiet force of cross-cultural allyship helping it flourish.\n\nThe U.S. connection: How Shereen Arent is building bridges, not blueprints\n\nThough Sambhali Trust is based in Rajasthan, the depth of its impact reaches far beyond India’s borders, thanks in large part to Sambhali U.S., a nonprofit that raises critical funds, provides technical assistance, and shares stories of resilience with American audiences. At the helm is Shereen Arent, whose journey with Sambhali began in 2019 with a self-funded volunteer trip that blossomed into deep, lasting relationships.\n\nSince then, Shereen has traveled to India more than half a dozen times at her own expense. She’s now considered a mentor and friend by many of the boarding home girls, some of whom she first met as teenagers and has watched grow into confident young women.\n\n“I think a key part of what makes Sambhali so successful is its inclusive and holistic approach to supporting marginalized communities,” Shereen told The Optimist Daily. “Sambhali grows in response to the community, whose members feel empowered to bring the obstacles they face to staff who then work with them to co-create programs.”\n\nA support system that honors Indian leadership\n\nAs Sambhali Trust’s impact has grown, so too has the role of Sambhali U.S., but always with humility and intention. Under Shereen’s leadership, the U.S. arm remains firmly rooted in community-led values.\n\n“Our job isn’t to direct,” she emphasizes. “It’s to support Sambhali’s vision while making sure our assistance respects and strengthens their leadership.”\n\nIn the past year alone, Sambhali U.S. has supported a wide range of initiatives: boarding homes, school scholarships, women’s self-help groups, menstrual health and nutrition workshops, and more. Volunteers have contributed to curriculum design, program evaluation, communications, and direct service. In total, Sambhali Trust has now reached more than 80,000 women and children across Rajasthan.\n\nFor Shereen, though, it always comes back to the people.\n\n“These are not just numbers or projects. These are people I know. Young women I met as high schoolers who are now in college. Families I’ve stayed in touch with. This is what makes the work matter.”\n\nThat human-centered approach is part of what makes the U.S.-India partnership so effective. Rather than leading the work, Sambhali U.S. amplifies it. They mobilize resources, share stories, and stand in solidarity with Sambhali’s India-based leadership every step of the way.\n\nWhy it matters now\n\nIn the areas Sambhali serves, only 28 percent of women can read and write. Fewer than 10 percent complete middle school. Despite education being mandatory for children in India ages 6 to 14, many girls are pulled out early or never even enrolled. Sambhali’s centers are rewriting that future.\n\nThrough inclusive education, trauma-informed support, and economic empowerment, Sambhali is shifting cultural norms from the inside out. From Rajasthan to the rest of the world, their message is clear: when you invest in women and girls, entire communities rise.\n\nLearn more and support this life-changing work at sambhalius.org",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union has been working on a strategy to protect the rights of people with disabilities from 2021 to 2030. This includes programs to make life easier, like the European Disability Card and AccessibleEU. Now, the EU Parliament wants to update and strengthen this plan for the years 2025 to 2030.\n\n**What happened** – On Thursday, the EU Parliament voted to adopt a new report with priorities for disability rights beyond 2024. The report passed with 409 votes in favor, 9 against, and 109 abstentions. It calls for a stronger strategy that includes clear laws and practical actions to help people with disabilities in many areas such as jobs, education, healthcare, housing, and digital services.\n\n**Impact** – This plan is important because many people with disabilities still face barriers that stop them from fully joining society. The new strategy wants to fix this by creating an EU-wide definition of disability, offering job training and skill guarantees, and making sure public places and services are accessible. It also focuses on helping women and girls with disabilities, who often face extra challenges.\n\n**What's next step** – The European Commission will now work on proposing new laws and actions based on this report. This could mean new rules about accessibility and clearer penalties for those who don’t follow them. The goal is to turn these ideas into real changes in all EU countries.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU Parliament has taken a big step to make sure people with disabilities have equal rights and better access to jobs, education, and services across Europe by updating its strategy for 2025-2030.",

      "summary": "On Thursday, Parliament called on the EU to assume more responsibility for European security and to support peace in Ukraine in the most proactive way.Committee on Foreign Affairs Source : © European Union, 2025 - EP",
      "content": "Following recent initiatives by the US administration to end the war in Ukraine, plenary adopted a resolution by 401 votes in favour, 70 against, and with 90 abstentions, urging the EU and its member states to show leadership in this crucial geopolitical moment and continue working with Washington and other like-minded partners to ensure that negotiations for a just and lasting peace respect the principles of international law. MEPs consider that any sustainable peace must be preceded by an effective ceasefire and underpinned by robust EU and US security guarantees to Kyiv - amounting to those of NATO’s Article 5 and the EU’s Article 42.7 - to prevent, deter and immediately counter any renewed aggression.\n\nMEPs also state that any temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory will not be legally recognised by the EU and its member states as Russian territory. Stressing the need for European involvement in any peace negotiations, as the outcome of the Ukraine war will have a profound impact on the entire European security order, they reiterate that “nothing about Ukraine should be decided without Ukraine, and nothing about Europe without Europe”.\n\nWashington’s ambivalence on Ukraine is detrimental to lasting peace\n\nThe text notes the US administration’s efforts towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. However, it considers Washington’s policy ambivalence towards Kyiv to be detrimental to the objective of achieving a lasting peace. MEPs also stress that any peace agreement must not put limitations on Ukraine’s capabilities to defend its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. They reiterate that Ukraine has the freedom to choose its security and political alliances without Russia having veto power over it.\n\nMEPs push for ‘reparations loan’ backed by frozen Russian assets for Ukraine\n\nThe resolution also underlines that any peace agreement must envisage full compensation by Russia for the material and immaterial harm and damage it has caused in Ukraine. MEPs call on the EU and its member states to adopt and implement, without further delay, a legally and financially sound ‘reparation loan’ for Ukraine, backed by frozen Russian assets. They clarify that the fate and conditions of the investment of the said assets are not a matter for negotiation without the EU. Parliament also insists that no EU sanctions be lifted prior to an implemented peace agreement based on negotiations. Should Russia refuse to join serious peace talks, MEPs call on the EU to impose further substantial sanctions.\n\nFor all the details, the resolution will be available in full here (27.11.2025).",
