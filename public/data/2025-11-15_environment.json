      "content": "If you’ve spent any time on a roof, you know that it’s not especially pleasant up there — blazing in the summer, frigid and windy in the winter. Slap some solar panels up there, though, and the calculus changes: Shaded from gusts and excessive sunlight, crops can proliferate, a technique known as rooftop agrivoltaics. And because that hardware provides shade, evaporation is reduced, resulting in big water savings. Plus, all that greenery insulates the top floor, reducing energy costs.\n\nLong held in opposition to one another, urban areas are embracing elements of the rural world as they try to produce more of their own food, in community gardens on the ground and agrivoltaics up above. In an increasingly chaotic climate, urban agriculture could improve food security, generate clean electricity, reduce local temperatures, provide refuges for pollinators, and improve mental and physical health for urbanites, among other benefits.\n\nYour support powers solutions-focused climate reporting — keeping it free for everyone.

Quezon City in the Philippines, for instance, has transformed unused land into more than 300 gardens and 10 farms, in the process training more than 4,000 urban farmers. Detroit is speckled with thousands of gardens and farms. In the Big Apple, the nonprofit Project Petals is turning vacant lots in underresourced neighborhoods into oases. “You have some places in New York City where there’s not a green space for 5 miles,” said Alicia White, executive director and founder of the group. “And we know that green spaces help to reduce stress. We know they help to combat loneliness, and we know at this point that they help to improve our respiratory and heart health.”\n\nA Project Petals project in Queens, New York. Project Petals\n\nThat makes these community spaces an especially potent climate solution, because it’s getting ever harder for people to stay healthy in cities due to the urban heat island effect, in which the built environment absorbs the sun’s energy and releases it throughout the night. Baking day after day during prolonged heat waves, the human body can’t get relief, an especially dangerous scenario for the elderly. But verdant patches reduce temperatures by releasing water vapor — essentially sweating into the neighborhood — and provide shade. At the same time, as climate change makes rainfall more extreme, urban gardens help soak up deluges, reducing the risk of flooding.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nOddly enough, while the oven-like effect is perilous for people, it can benefit city farms. On rooftops, scientists are finding that some crops, like leafy greens, thrive under the shade of solar panels, but others — especially warm-season crops like zucchini and watermelon — grow beautifully in harsh full-sun conditions. “Most of our high-value crops benefit from the urban heat island effect, because it extends their growing season. So growing food in the city is actually quite logical,” said horticulturist Jennifer Bousselot, who studies rooftop agrivoltaics at Colorado State University. “This summer we had cucumbers that were the size of baseball bats, that were perfectly suited to the green roof.”\n\nPlants grow on a roof at Colorado State University.\n\nKevin Samuelson, CSU Spur\n\nThat’s not all that’s thriving up there. Bousselot and her team are also growing a trio of Indigenous crops: corn, beans, and squash. The beans climb the corn stalks — and microbes in their roots fix nitrogen, enriching the soil — while the squash leaves shade the soil and reduce evaporation, saving water. In addition, they’ve found that saffron — an extremely expensive and difficult-to-harvest spice — tolerates the shade of rooftop solar panels. Water leaving the soil also cools the panels, increasing their efficiency. “We’re essentially creating a microclimate, very much like a greenhouse, which is one of the most optimal conditions for most of our food crops to grow in,” Bousselot said. “But it’s not a system that needs heating or cooling or ventilation, like a greenhouse does.”\n\nGrowers might even use the extreme conditions of a rooftop for another advantage. Plants that aren’t shaded by solar panels produce “secondary metabolites” in response to the heat, wind, and constant sunlight that can stress them. These are often antioxidants, which a grower might be able to tease out of a medicinal plant like chamomile — at least in theory. “We are sort of exploring the breadth of what’s possible up there,” Bousselot said, “and using those unique environments to come up with crops that are hopefully even more valuable to the producer.”\n\nKevin Samuelson, CSU Spur\n\nDown on the ground in New York City, Project Petals has seen a similar bonanza. Whereas agricultural regions cultivate vast fields and orchards of monocrops, like grains or fruit trees, an urban farm can pack a bunch of different foods into a tight space. “If you could grow it in rural areas, you could grow it in the city as well,” White said. “We’ve grown squash, snap peas, lemongrass. In our gardens, I’ve seen just about everything.”\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nThat sort of diversification means a cornucopia of nutritious foods flows into the community. (Lots of different species also provide different kinds of flowers for pollinators — and the more pollinators, the better the crops and native plants in the area can reproduce, creating a virtuous cycle.) That’s invaluable because in the United States, access to proper nutrition is extremely unequal: In Mississippi, for example, 30 percent of people live in low-income areas with low access to good food, compared to 4 percent in New York. This leads to “silent hunger,” in which people have access to enough calories — often from ultraprocessed foods purchased at corner stores — but not enough nutrients.\n\nUnderserved neighborhoods need better access to supermarkets, of course, but rooftop and community gardens can provide fresh food and help educate people about improving their diets. “It’s not only about growing our own veggies in the city, but actually too it’s a hook to change habits,” said Nikolas Galli, a postdoctoral researcher who studies urban agriculture at the Polytechnic University of Milan.\n\nWorkers tend to crops in Queens, New York. Project Petals\n\nIn a study published last month in the journal Earth’s Future, Galli modeled what this change could look like on a wide scale in São Paulo, Brazil. In a theoretical scenario in which the city turned its feasible free space — around 14 square miles — into gardens and farms, every couple of acres of food production could provide healthy sustenance to more than 600 people. Though the scenario isn’t particularly realistic, given the scale of change required, “it’s interesting to think about that, if we use more or less all the areas that we have, we could provide the missing fruits and vegetables for 13 to 21 percent of the population of the city,” Galli said. “Every square meter that you do can have a function, can be useful to increase the access to healthy food for someone.”\n\nWithout urgent action here, silent hunger will only grow worse as urban populations explode around the world: By 2050, 70 percent of humans will live in cities. Urban farms could go a long way toward helping feed all those people, and could indeed benefit from rural farmers making the move to metropolises. “They’re able to pass it on to the community members like me from New York City, who maybe didn’t have the expertise,” White said, “and helping them to find their way in learning how to garden and learning how to grow their own food.”\n\nWhether it’s on top of a roof or tucked between apartment buildings, the urban garden is a simple yet uniquely powerful tool for solving a slew of environmental and human health problems. “They’re serving as spaces where people can grow, where they can learn, and they can help to fight climate change,” White said. “It’s so good to see that people are starting to come around to the fact that a garden space, and a green space, can actually make a bigger impact than just on that community overall.”",

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 14 November 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03529-zFaced with the double threat of rising sea levels and subsiding ground, researchers are devising plans to bring communities back from the brink.",
      "content": "As China’s cities become taller, bigger and more modern, they face a major problem: the ground beneath them is sinking. A 2024 study1 found that nearly half of the land under the country’s major cities is subsiding at a “moderate” rate of more than 3 millimetres a year, and 16% is experiencing “rapid” sinking, meaning greater than 10 millimetres annually.\n\nMany of these cities, such as Tianjin, Fuzhou and Ningbo, are located by the sea. The issue of land subsidence is so pressing that the study projected that one in ten residents of the country’s coastal cities will be living below sea level by 2120 if current trends continue.\n\nThe consequences are already showing. In 2023, nearly 4,000 people in Tianjin — a port city of more than 13 million residents — had to be evacuated from high-rise apartment buildings after the streets outside suddenly split apart. Scientists sent to investigate the site believe that the problem was caused by a ‘geological cavity’ some 1,300 metres under the ground, according to the city’s government. They pointed to the drilling of a geothermal well as a possible trigger, which might have caused subterranean water and soil loss, leading the land to give way.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science cities\n\nChina’s plight provides a snapshot of a global crisis. Eight of the world’s ten largest cities are situated on the coast, including Shanghai, New York, India’s Mumbai and Lagos in Nigeria, and all of them are dealing with subsidence. The megacities that are rapidly expanding along Asia’s shores are among the fastest-sinking cities on the planet, according to a 2022 study2.\n\nThe highest subsidence rates have been recorded in Tianjin, Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City and Bangladesh’s Chittagong; parts of these cities were found to be subsiding at peak speeds of more than 50 millimetres per year. In North America, subsidence is also widespread. An analysis of 28 major US cities, including coastal cities such as Houston and New York, published this year3 estimated that at least one-fifth of all mapped urban areas are sinking, affecting some 34 million people.\n\nSubsidence is not an issue that any one country can fight on its own. Some Chinese cities, such as Shanghai and Guangzhou, have modelled initiatives based on what’s worked in the Netherlands, for example, one of the lowest-lying countries in the world. Residents and institutions are encouraged by their local government to collect and reuse rainwater, such as by installing ‘green roofs’ covered with vegetation to hold rainwater, and building communal gardens to absorb or slow runoff.\n\nChina is also passing on its knowledge to other developing countries. In 2023, Shenzhen shared its experience of evacuating people from partly subsided buildings with policymakers from Tripoli in Lebanon, through a collaborative effort co-organized by the United Nations Development Programme to help the city better respond to natural disasters.\n\nAccording to Liu Jianxin, a geophysicist at Central South University in Changsha, China, Chinese researchers are increasingly sharing data, writing papers and participating in workshops with international colleagues on the issue of subsidence. And, like Liu, many of them are based in inland cities that are also facing subsidence. “Tackling subsidence is a global effort,” Liu says.\n\nCoastal challenges\n\nCoastal cities are particularly susceptible to sinking because of their natural conditions. For one, they are often built on river deltas or coastal plains, where sediments compact over time, which leads to subsidence, says Ding Xiaoli, a geodesist at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, who measures and monitors Earth’s shape and size. Some coastal cities, such as Tokyo, also sit on earthquake-prone areas, where tectonic activity can contribute to subsidence.\n\nBut the growth of coastal cities itself — nearly one-third of the global population in 2018, or more than 2 billion, lived within 50 kilometres from the shore — is also greatly exacerbating the issue.\n\nSource: Cosby, A. G. et al. Sci. Rep. 14, 22489 (2024)\n\nIn China, the main cause of subsidence linked to human activity is the excessive extraction of groundwater as cities expand, says Zhang Yonghong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping in Beijing. The practice lowers the underground water level, which causes the surrounding soil to compact and the land to sink. “The building of infrastructure, such as subways, can also cause parts of a city to subside,” Zhang says.\n\nDisruption to the natural recharging of groundwater owing to paved urban surfaces can worsen the situation, says Yu Kongjian, a landscape architect at Peking University in Beijing. “Land subsidence is one of the most profound manifestations of ecological mismanagement in urban regions,” he says.\n\nCities are also getting heavier as they grow, says Zhao Qing, a geodesist at East China Normal University in Shanghai. Ongoing research by her team suggests that the increasing weight of buildings is one of the three factors — together with dropping groundwater levels and the nature of the soil — that are causing Shanghai and other cities in the Yangtze River Delta region to subside.\n\nNone of the above is unique to China, and some of these issues — such as groundwater extraction and building weight — often affect cities inland, too. But on the coast, these factors are driving the land downwards in areas that also face accelerated sea-level rise owing to climate change.\n\nThe speed at which sea levels are rising has more than doubled over the past three decades4, increasing from around 2.1 millimetres per year in 1993 to around 4.5 millimetres per year in 2023. By the end of this century, the global average sea level is projected to be up to 0.55 metres higher than the 1995–2014 average, even if the world limits global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement.\n\nA 2022 study5 that assessed 99 coastal cities around the world found that most of them saw parts of their land subside faster than the sea level was rising. At their current downward trajectories, they would be challenged by flooding much sooner than the timelines projected by sea-level models, the authors said.\n\nOne of the cities that has been struck by this double whammy is Jakarta, the current capital of Indonesia, an archipelagic country on the frontline of fighting sea-level rise. More than 40% of the city is already below sea level — where risks of flooding, storm surges, infrastructure damage and economic and life losses are particularly high — and by the middle of the century up to 95% of its coastal areas might be submerged. The grim prospect was a major factor in Indonesia deciding to move its capital to a different island by 2028.\n\nSince 2014, Indonesia has been building a 32-kilometre ‘Giant Sea Wall’ in a bid to shield Jakarta from flooding — a project that is expected to cost US$50 billion. But sea walls have shallow foundations, so they follow the movement of the land, says Pietro Teatini, a hydrologist at the University of Padova in Italy, and chair of the UNESCO Land Subsidence International Initiative (LaSII), a working group that aims to spread knowledge on subsidence around the world and help developing countries to better address the issue. “If the land subsides, the wall subsides, too,” he says.\n\nLand and sea A comparison of five coastal cities and five inland cities in China shows how each group has been pursuing research in areas related to climate change and aquatic life and environments over the past six years. Output is measured by Share — a fractional metric that quantifies cities’ output in the high-quality natural-sciences and health-sciences journals tracked by the Nature Index.\n\nSuccessful measures\n\nShanghai — the first city in China to identify subsidence — also faces the compounding effect of sinking ground and rising sea level. It sank by 1.69 metres from 1921 to 1965 as a result of excessive groundwater pumping. The city’s government has carried out a series of measures to tackle the issue over the past 60 years, mainly by restricting groundwater usage and replenishing groundwater supply using water from the Yangtze River, according to Ye Shujun, a hydrogeologist at Nanjing University in China. Those methods have reduced the speed at which Shanghai is sinking to within 6 millimetres a year, said Ye, who shared the city’s experience at a webinar organized by LaSII in early 2025.\n\nA lot of work has been done in China to address subsidence from scientific and technical points of view, says Teatini. “One of the most important” steps for tackling subsidence is the artificial recharging of groundwater, he says, which has proved effective in Shanghai. But he warns that the method is expensive, so it might be hard to introduce to poorer countries.\n\nTeatini points to the advanced equipment that Chinese cities use, such as extensometers, which measure how materials change under stress. Researchers drill down , sometimes to almost 1,000 metres, to place the devices at the bottom of Earth’s water-bearing layers, known as the aquifer system, to monitor which layers are compacting. “In Italy, we have three or four [extensometers] spread all over the country. In Shanghai, there are about 50,” says Teatini, who works with Chinese researchers regularly.\n\nSome of Teatini’s long-term collaborators come from the Capital Normal University in Beijing, which has forged a formal partnership with the University of Padova. They have teamed up in a series of studies, ranging from assessing the causes of Beijing’s subsidence to developing models for predicting the problem.\n\nTo Teatini, China’s action to reduce land subsidence has been “very, very effective”. One of its achievements comes through the South–North Water Transfer Project, a colossal infrastructure project launched by the government to divert water from the south of the country to the water-stressed north. Although the main goal of the project is to balance water supplies, it has played a crucial role in mitigating long-term subsidence of the North China Plain by reducing the extraction of groundwater. Before the project went into operation in 2014, Beijing, situated in the country’s arid north, had heavily relied on groundwater and suffered severe subsidence of up to 159 millimetres a year as a result.",

      "content": "Set to launch no earlier than Nov. 16, Sentinel-6B will continue a decades-long data record of sea level measurement that will help decision-makers manage coastal flooding, support hurricane intensity forecasts, and assist in the return of astronauts from space. NASA\n\nData from Sentinel-6B will continue a decades-long record of sea surface height, helping to improve coastal planning, protect critical infrastructure, and advance weather forecasts.\n\nWith launch set for no earlier than 12:21 a.m. EST Monday, Nov. 17, Sentinel-6B is the latest satellite in a series of spacecraft NASA and its partners have used to measure sea levels since 1992. Their data has helped meteorologists improve hurricane forecasts, managers protect infrastructure, and coastal communities plan.\n\nAfter launch, Sentinel-6B will begin the process of data cross-calibration with its predecessor, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, to provide essential information about Earth’s ocean.\n\nSentinel-6B is the second of two satellites that constitute the Sentinel-6/Jason-CS (Continuity of Service) mission, a collaboration between NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The European Commission contributed funding support while France’s space agency CNES (Centre National d’Études Spatiales) provided technical expertise.\n\nHere are six things to know about Sentinel-6B and the broader Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission:\n\n1. Sentinel-6B will deliver data on about 90% of Earth’s ocean, providing direct benefits to humanity.\n\nSentinel-6B will contribute to a multidecade dataset for sea level measurements from space. This data is key to helping improve public safety, city planning, and protecting commercial and defense interests.\n\nPioneered by NASA and its partners, the dataset enables users in government, industry, and the research community to better understand how sea levels change over time. Combined with information from other NASA satellites, data from Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS is vital for tracking how heat and energy move through Earth’s seas and atmosphere, as well as for monitoring ocean features such as currents and eddies. The measurements come courtesy of a radar altimeter that measures sea levels for nearly all of Earth’s ocean, providing information on large-scale currents that can aid in commercial and naval navigation, search and rescue, and the tracking of debris and pollutants from disasters at sea.\n\nSentinel-6B is part of a U.S.-European mission that will continue 30-year-plus record of sea-level measurements. Its observations will help build an accurate picture of local and global sea surface heights to support storm forecasting, secure coastal infrastructure, and help optimize commercial activities, such as shipping.\n\nCredit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n2. Data from the Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission helps NASA prepare for the next phase of space exploration.\n\nThe better we understand Earth, the better NASA can carry out its mission to explore the universe. Data from the Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission is used to refine the Goddard Earth Observing System atmospheric forecast models, which the NASA Engineering Safety Center uses to plan safer reentry of astronauts returning from Artemis missions.\n\nAdditionally, changes to Earth’s ocean, observed by satellites, can have measurable effects beyond our planet. For instance, while the Moon influences ocean tides on Earth, changes in those tides can also exert a small influence on the Moon. Data from Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS can help improve understanding of this relationship, knowledge that can contribute to future lunar exploration missions.\n\n3. The Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission helps the U.S. respond to challenges by putting actionable information into the hands of decision-makers.\n\nData collected by the mission helps city planners, as well as local and state governments, to make informed decisions on protecting coastal infrastructure, real estate, and energy facilities. The mission’s sea level data also improves meteorologists’ weather predictions, which are critical to commercial and recreational navigation. By enhancing weather prediction models, data provided by Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS improves forecasts of hurricane development, including the likelihood of storm intensification, which can aid disaster preparedness and response.\n\n4. Data from Sentinel-6B will support national security efforts.\n\nThe ocean and atmosphere measurements from Sentinel-6B will enable decision-makers to better protect coastal military installations from such events as nuisance flooding while aiding national defense efforts by providing crucial information about weather and ocean conditions. The satellite will do so by feeding near-real time data on Earth’s atmosphere and seas to forward-looking weather and ocean models. Since the measurements are part of a long-term dataset, they also can add historical context that puts the new data in perspective.\n\n5. The Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission’s direct observation of sea levels delivers information critical to protecting coastlines, where nearly half of the world’s population lives.\n\nSea level rise varies from one area to another, meaning that some coastlines are more vulnerable than others to flooding, erosion, and saltwater contamination of underground freshwater supplies, the latter of which threatens farmland and drinking water. Sea level measurements from Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, and soon, Sentinel-6B, form the basis of U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites, and other coastal assets. Knowing which regions are more vulnerable to these risks will enable U.S. industries and emergency managers to make better-informed decisions about transportation and commercial infrastructure, land-use planning, water management, and adaptation strategies.\n\n6. The international collaboration behind the mission enables the pooling of capabilities, resources, and expertise.\n\nThe multidecadal dataset that this mission supports is the result of years of close work between NASA and several collaborators, including NASA, ESA, EUMETSAT, CNES, and NOAA. By pooling expertise and resources, this partnership has delivered cost-effective solutions that have made precise, high-impact data available to industry and government agencies alike.\n\nMore about Sentinel-6B\n\nCopernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS was jointly developed by ESA, EUMETSAT, NASA, and NOAA, with funding support from the European Commission and technical support from CNES. The mission also marks the first international involvement in Copernicus, the European Union’s Earth Observation Programme.\n\nManaged for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, JPL contributed three science instruments for each Sentinel-6 satellite: the Advanced Microwave Radiometer, the Global Navigation Satellite System – Radio Occultation, and the laser retroreflector array. NASA is also contributing launch services, ground systems supporting operation of the NASA science instruments, the science data processors for two of these instruments, and support for the international ocean surface topography community.\n\nFor more about Sentinel-6B, visit:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/sentinel-6B\n\nNews Media Contacts\n\nElizabeth Vlock\n\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n\n202-358-1600\n\nelizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov\n\nAndrew Wang / Andrew Good\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n\n626-379-6874 / 626-840-4291\n\nandrew.wang@jpl.nasa.gov / andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\n\n2025-124",

      "summary": "In total, about 30 proposals appear in the \"Letter from the Peripheries on Commitments for the Climate – The Atmosphere is Tense!,” signed by 50 collectives and 1,000 community leaders",
      "content": "This story, written by Isabela Alves, was originally published on October 31, 2025, on Agência Mural’s website. The edited article is republished here under a partnership agreement with Global Voices.\n\nNot expanding landfills in poorer neighbourhoods, promoting environmental education in schools and other spaces, creating a green currency for recycling, and holding big polluters and public authorities accountable for preservation.\n\nThese are some of the proposals developed by activists from the peripheries — marginalized, poorer neighborhoods — of São Paulo, Brazil, the largest city in Latin America. They are to be taken to COP 30 (the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference), being held between November 10 and 21, in the city of Belém, in the northern Brazilian state of Pará.\n\nIn total, about 30 proposals appear in the “Letter from the Peripheries on Commitments for the Climate – The Atmosphere is Tense!,” signed by 50 collectives and 1,000 community leaders. As well as the proposed ideas, the document provides an analysis of the situation in these areas in the face of climate change.\n\n“We plan to connect with people from other countries, other regions and marginalized areas of Brazil, so that together we can present a project shaped by society’s peripheries,” said Edson Pardinho, 50, coordinator of the Peripheral [Neighbourhoods’] Front for Rights, which organized the letter.\n\nThe Peripheral [Neighbourhoods’] Front for Rights came out of the collaboration of social movements during the COVID-19 pandemic, when they acted to help families by distributing food, hygiene kits, and masks. Following the pandemic, the collectives continued their work together.\n\nIn the months before the COP, the front mobilized activists to discuss climate goals in their neighbourhoods and draft their collective proposals.\n\n“[Climatic changes] first affect the outer peripheries, and only then are they felt in the more protected areas. Those who live in peripheral neighbourhoods have been dealing with climate change for a long time,” Pardinho observed.\n\nThe letter presents ideas with the objective of guiding public policies and community practices that promote socio-environmental justice. It emphasizes the importance of strengthening public involvement in decisions concerning their territory. The suggestions include actions aimed at waste management, environmental education, decent housing, a solidarity economy, and basic sanitation.\n\nMarginalized voices speaking about the climate\n\nThe letter highlights that the historical expansion of São Paulo’s peripheral areas was driven by the lack of urban planning. “The city’s rapid expansion was not [socioeconomically] neutral: it prioritized major economic interests, such as those of the real estate market, whose exclusionary logic relegated poorer people to dilapidated, risky areas.”\n\n“People have developed their own technologies to make sure they survive, even with the worsening climate situation,” said Pardinho, a resident of the Dom Tomás Balduíno Settlement in Franco da Rocha, São Paulo.\n\nMateus Munadas, 34, is one of the founders of the Peripheral [Neighbourhoods’] Front for Rights and a resident of Itaquera district. For him, it is important that peripheral activists attend the COP, as the perspectives of those who truly feel the impacts of the climate emergency daily are never taken into account.\n\n“There are common points of vulnerability between these marginalized neighbourhoods, and there are also many people fighting for change in these areas,” he said.\n\nAmong their proposed solutions are actions such as cleaning streams, community vegetable gardens and farms, solidarity groups during storms, environmental support networks, and community communications. In the field of education, social educators, culture collectives, and teachers are working tirelessly to raise awareness about SDOs (Sustainable Development Objectives), and warn about the environmental racism experienced in marginalized areas.\n\nThere are also other solutions, such as community reforestation, strengthening recycling cooperatives, expanding rainwater collection networks, and plans for local adaptation guided by the communities themselves, according to sources Mural spoke to.\n\nA place for discussion\n\nThe Guaraní people from the Tekoá Pyau Indigenous Village, in Jaraguá, called for the protection of Indigenous peoples, and highlighted that their survival is essential for environmental preservation.\n\n“It is not only about the increase in temperature, but [also] the survival of human beings who cohabit wooded and forested spaces. They are directly targeted by landowners and real estate speculation,” Pardinho said.\n\nThe coordinator of Casa Ecoativa, Jaison Lara, explained that the manifesto also questions the logic behind an event historically composed mostly by older, white, and cisgender men who nevertheless speak on behalf of the diverse range of residents and territories.\n\n“If there are only diplomatic figures [present], the [same] powerful people as always, it will likely be an empty event as it won’t take into account knowledge from the peripheries, quilombolas [settlements of residents descended from enslaved people who escaped to freedom], Indigenous and riverside dwellers,” said Lara.\n\nIn one of the meetings, Lara talked to more than 200 children. “These are the main people facing the environmental disasters that have been happening. We are leaving [them] a collapsing planet, and this isn’t their fault. There are no public policies that relate to this age group, that look at these children,” he said.\n\nThe housing issue\n\nA key question for those living in the peripheries is the right to housing, especially in areas such as the very south of São Paulo. Here, there are houses built irregularly in the “APAs” (Environmental Protection Areas). In recent months, Greater São Paulo has seen a series of actions by authorities and judicial decisions against these occupations.\n\n“Housing and the environment must go together,” argued Clair Helena Santos, 67, coordinator of the housing movement for Missionária-Cidade Ademar and Cecasul (Citizenship and Social Action Centre – South).\n\nSantos joined the social movement at the age of 17 and has been selected as an activist to attend COP30. “Having housing, I understood that it is the channel for all other human rights: health, education, transport, leisure, and so many others,” she said.\n\nThe letter to the COP proposes an “end to evictions and violent practices against settlements and favelas,” and programs aimed at people living in at-risk areas, so that they do not find themselves with nowhere to go if anything happens to their homes.\n\nThe letter shows the main demands of communities in areas such as Cidade Ademar and Pedreira, regions hit hard by climate change, as they are near dams or sewage flows.\n\nA recent example of environmental impact was the construction of a bridge on Alvarenga Road, which passes over the Billings Dam, one of the largest water reservoirs in São Paulo, affecting aquatic fauna and plants.\n\n“There’s no point in the big guys staying there discussing the environment and fighting floods if the peripheries and social movements are not represented, right? For us, it’s the maxim of nothing about us, without us,” Santos observed.",
