      "content": "Theoretical astrophysicist Debarati Chatterjee has always seen gender for what it is — a social construct. Despite witnessing domestic violence as a child, experiencing sexual harassment as an undergraduate and a PhD student, and being one of the small proportion (around 20%) of astronomers in the world who are women, she hasn’t let her gender define her career.\n\nLeaving her home country of India to start a postdoctoral position in Germany in 2010, she saw that prejudices based on race, class and gender also existed in the international scientific community. Chatterjee works in the emerging and male-dominated field of gravitational-wave science. She studies neutron stars — ultra-dense cores that are left over when massive stars collapse — by looking at gravitational waves, or ripples in the fabric of space-time. It’s an approach that brings together several disciplines, including nuclear, particle and condensed-matter physics.\n\nOn her return to India in 2020, she joined the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune. In June, the 45-year-old was promoted to full professor, becoming the first woman to be awarded this role in the institution’s 37-year history. Her research group generates complex theoretical models to crack the mystery of the interior composition of neutron stars.\n\nShe also wants more women to pursue science subjects, especially astrophysics, and has held various roles to promote gender equity. She was a core member of the IUCAA’s committee to combat sexual harassment and was part of the Astronomical Society of India’s Working Group for Gender Equity, for which she helped to run campaigns highlighting pioneering work by female Indian scientists. An avid science communicator, this year, Chatterjee launched the Indian branch of the Pint of Science festival — an annual festival that invites scientist to pubs and cafés to share their latest research — this year across three cities. Chatterjee has also popularized the science behind the planned Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory-India (LIGO-India), which is to be built in a rural area called Hingoli. By delivering talks at schools, universities and astronomy clubs across India, she helps to inspire girls and young women to become scientists.\n\nChatterjee spoke to Nature about how she overcame sexual harassment to become an astrophysicist, and why she promotes gender and racial diversity in her field.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a scientist?\n\nCuriosity and adventure have always driven me. Since childhood, I have been obsessed with finding solutions, and I don’t rest until I get to the root of the issue. The fact that science can be about addressing extremely complex problems, which can take a lifetime to solve, excites me. Even for someone like Einstein, conundrums in fields such as quantum physics and general relativity were too difficult to solve in his lifetime. During my undergraduate studies at St Xavier’s College in Kolkata, my summer project at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) was about understanding how the Sun rotates, a question that remains unanswered. That was when I fell in love with how the academic world works.\n\nWhen I went to the IIA, I realized I didn’t need to pursue a 9-to-5 routine. I saw that some researchers woke up at 10 a.m. and worked past midnight — then they would go off to play badminton until the early hours. I was very attracted to this way of life. Also, visiting observatories such as the Vainu Bappu Observatory in Tamil Nadu, which is in the middle of a forest, felt like an adventure that I was ready to have for the rest of my life.\n\nDebarati Chatterjee (front row, second from right) with students at a Pint of Science outreach event.Credit: Kshitij Parshetti/Pint of Science India\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to tackle racism and sexism in science?\n\nThere have been countless times during my professional life when I have confronted unfriendly racist or sexist attitudes. I remember one incident when I was a postdoc overseas. A visitor to the laboratory made an incorrect statement during a seminar, and I pointed it out. While I was having this conversation, several members of my institute walked out of the room in protest at my questioning the visitor. Such disrespectful microaggressions were a daily occurrence.\n\nAs a foreigner, if I didn’t speak the local language, I would be left out during important conversations, which sometimes happened when researchers were socializing. Many of my peers would give up and retreat into isolation. Instead, I learnt to speak five languages with enough fluency that I could give interviews in them. Adapting to new fields of research and work environments is crucial for all early-career researchers, and it is often necessary for people to receive full credit for their contributions and achievements. These days, there are welcome centres that help international students to tackle such issues.\n\nAt other times, while taking part in official inquiries into why there are so few women in nuclear and particle physics, I have had an institute director barge in demanding to know, “Why is this taking so long?”. These experiences have motivated me to stand up for myself, and to work towards diversity, equity and inclusion to set an example for others who might not speak up because of a lack of support. I have heard from leading female theoretical physicists about how hard their journey has been and why speaking up is necessary.\n\nHow have you dealt with racism or discrimination in your personal and professional life?\n\nDuring my PhD, I faced many instances of sexual harassment from a senior scientist. I had no choice but to continue my studies, because my living expenses depended on my fellowship. This person often told me that I was not good enough and that my work was inconsequential. The overwhelming pressure of the situation threw me into clinical depression, and I had to consult a therapist. I also took my grievance to the head of the department, who advised me to focus on completing my degree, because I was close to submitting my thesis. Two decades ago, there were hardly any female theoretical physicists at my university, and there was no office to which one could complain. I even trained in martial arts for self-defence at the time.\n\nTowards the end of my PhD, I won a German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) fellowship, which gave me and my work international exposure, and helped me to develop a wide collaboration network. That is how I became an independent researcher who did not have to rely on any senior scientist for advancement.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor, and why?",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nDebarati Chatterjee is a scientist from India who studies astrophysics, the science of stars and space. She works with gravitational waves, ripples in space-time, to learn about neutron stars, which are very dense remains of dead stars. Science, especially in her field, has been mostly male-dominated.\n\n**What happened**\nIn 2025, Chatterjee became the first woman to be promoted to full professor at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune, India. She returned to India in 2020 after working in Germany and has been leading research on neutron stars. Alongside her scientific work, she has actively worked to fight gender and racial discrimination in science by organizing campaigns, helping with anti-harassment committees, and communicating science to the public, especially encouraging girls and women to enter science.\n\n**Impact**\nChatterjee’s promotion is historic because no woman had reached this level at IUCAA in its 37 years. Her leadership shows that women can succeed in tough, male-dominated fields like astrophysics. Her efforts to promote diversity and inclusion help create a fairer environment for future generations. For example, she started the Indian branch of the Pint of Science festival, making complex science more accessible and inspiring young people.\n\n**What’s next step**\nChatterjee will continue her research on neutron stars and support gender equity in science. She plans to keep inspiring girls by visiting schools and universities, and she helps explain big projects like LIGO-India, a new gravitational wave observatory being built in rural India. Her work may encourage more women to join science and help create a more welcoming space for them.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nDebarati Chatterjee’s journey and leadership mark an important step for women in Indian astrophysics and show how science can become more inclusive.\n",

      "summary": "On the scheduled final day of COP30 in Belém, tense negotiations are stretching into Friday afternoon as divisions persist. Amid the ongoing talks, one message is cutting through the noise: there is no climate justice without gender equality.",
      "content": "Women’s voices are rising with clarity and urgency, pressing negotiators to ensure the conference leaves a lasting mark on the link between gender and climate policy.\n\nAt the heart of talks is the Belém Gender Action Plan – a proposed blueprint that acknowledges climate change hits women hardest and sets out measures for financing, training, and leadership roles.\n\n“Climate justice only exists when gender equality does too,” says Ana Carolina Querino, Acting Representative of UN Women in Brazil, echoing a sentiment heard across the halls and venues since the summit opened last Monday, 10 November.\n\nIf adopted, the plan would run from 2026 to 2034, embedding gender-responsive approaches into just transitions, adaptation and mitigation strategies, and mechanisms for loss and damage.\n\nUN News/Felipe de Carvalho Nanci Darcolete is an autonomous waste picker from São Paulo and advocacy advisor for Movimento de Pimpadores.\n\nWaste pickers on the frontline of emissions cuts\n\nOn the streets of São Paulo, Nanci Darcolete has been a waste picker since 1999.\n\nToday, she leads Pimp My Carroça, an organisation fighting for the rights of workers who turn discarded materials into resources – preventing mountains of waste from being dumped or burned.\n\nWaste pickers, she says, played a historic role at COP30 by showing how their work slashes emissions and eases pressure on natural resources.\n\n“We now see how important it is for waste pickers to also work on composting organic waste,” she explains. “That’s going to save municipalities money, provide income for waste pickers, and capture tons and tons of gases [and] delivering major mitigation by removing heavy pollutants from the environment.”\n\nWomen leading the recycling chain\n\nIn Brazil, women make up most waste pickers and head most cooperatives. Yet they still face racism and gender-based violence on the streets, often while juggling care for homes and families.\n\nFor Nanci, climate change is making their work harder. Rising heat and flooding hit low-income neighbourhoods hardest, adding strain to already tough conditions. She wants COP30’s adaptation agenda to recognise waste pickers as “agents of transformation,” with better urban logistics, hydration points, and paid contracts.\n\nLitigation as a weapon for climate justice\n\nAcross the Atlantic, 24-year-old Portuguese lawyer Mariana Gomes is using the law as what she calls “the most important tool” to fight the climate crisis. She founded Último Recurso, the group behind Portugal’s first climate litigation case – now leading more than 170 lawsuits.\n\nMariana believes litigation can turn promises into binding action, especially after the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) recent opinion requiring states to act to keep global warming under 1.5°C.\n\n“I believe that in the future we’ll see many lawsuits against States, especially those who must raise ambition, adopt climate laws, and align their targets with the Paris Agreement. Because now, more than ever, we are carrying on our backs the weight of the International Court of Justice,” she tells us.\n\nUN News/Felipe de Carvalho Portuguese lawyer Mariana Gomes is a social entrepreneur and climate activist.\n\nThe right to a clean, healthy environment\n\nMariana argues citizens can demand their governments guarantee the right to a clean, healthy environment and a stable climate. In Portugal, she is pushing for Municipal Climate Action Plans to help local authorities prepare for droughts, wildfires, floods, and other disasters.\n\nFor her, adaptation and mitigation must recognise that climate disasters hit women hardest, increasing risks of gender-based violence, displacement, and care burdens. Litigation, she says, can do more than cut emissions or stop extractive projects, it can unlock funding and compensation for affected communities, protecting women’s rights along the way.\n\nUN News is reporting from Belém, bringing you front-row coverage of everything unfolding at COP30.",

      "title": "How citizen archivists in South Asia confront the online marginalization of oral cultures and languages",
      "summary": "Citizen archivists are preserving South Asia’s oral traditions — folk songs, riddles, and histories — by recording, uploading, and transcribing them on Wikimedia platforms, challenging text-centric knowledge systems and reviving marginalized voices.",
      "content": "What can an O Bele folk song from the Tulu community in southern India tell us about how farmers would entertain themselves while planting crops? What can a Tharu folk song from northern India illuminate about the issue of migration of men for work and potentially also of a river? What does the depiction of Lord Shiva being robbed while taking a nap, a frequent instance of anthropomorphism in Angika folk songs from India and Nepal, teach us about the contrast between prescriptive forms of gods in scriptures and their depiction in everyday folk practices? Or what can oral culture videos explain about the rise of Torwali speakers from Pakistan against the marginalization of their culture by the prominent religio-political practices?\n\nOral narratives like folk songs and oral history explore the realities of common people that are rarely emphasized in mainstream education, knowledge sharing, and mass media. The medium of expression, i.e., the exclusively oral sharing of these beliefs and knowledge systems, further alienates them in a text-centric world. In a bid to challenge this, citizen archivists have recorded oral culture videos, uploaded them on Wikimedia Commons, and are transcribing them for accessibility, linking them to open knowledge platforms like Wikisource and Wikipedia, and writing blogs about their experience. These activities are being guided and supported by the project “Enhancing Indic oral culture on Wikimedia projects.” Thus, citizen archivists from 14 South Asian language communities have yielded 227 recorded folk songs, riddles, oral histories, medicinal knowledge, and more.\n\nAlthough this article talks about only a few communities that have recorded their culture, the archived oral culture videos have captured generations of knowledge now at risk of disappearance under culture homogenization.\n\nHow modernization is eroding Tulu agricultural folk songs\n\nIn Tulu, O bele pardhana folk songs are the stories of Daiva (revered spirits in the coastal region of Tulunadu) sung in agricultural fields by farmers as a means to entertain themselves during the cropping and harvesting seasons. For instance, the O Bele song narrates a girl’s journey from childhood to marriage — one person sings the lyrics and others join in the chorus “O Bele.” Called “kabithe” (poems) locally, agricultural songs like these were practiced communally, with farmers sitting in a row and singing one by one while sowing seeds.\n\nAs the singer progresses singing, she encourages the archivist as well as the children around her to join in the chorus. Video : “Yenel the kabithe o bele – Made with Clipchamp” by Babitha Shetty . L icensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 .\n\nKavitha Ganesh, one of the Tulu citizen archivists who collected folk songs, medicinal knowledge, oral history, etc., contemplates over a phone interview the vanishing of Tulu agricultural folk songs as an indication of their change in lifestyle, under pressure from the challenging economics of agriculture:\n\nThe singer in the video showed us the crop field in which they used to sing together. But old people no longer practice farming and don't remember these songs very well. Machines are replacing people, young people aren’t practicing farming, so they are not learning these songs either. They would rather become sweepers in malls as field work is quite hard and does not pay enough to even buy oil and spices. People are moving from grains to areca farming, it requires less investment.\n\nDocumenting these is a race against time, as in Angika language, my mother recalls that agricultural folk songs, once abundant in her childhood, have now completely vanished.\n\nA less severe image of gods in Angika folk songs within subaltern folk practice\n\nIn the evaluation of the around 80 Angika folk songs I collected, many of them with a religious strain sung by Dalit women, gods are more in the role of family elders than the almighty, and sometimes a goddess is envisioned as a bride adorned in jewels. For instance, in one of the Shibguru songs, lord Shiva is robbed while napping in the temple on a summer afternoon. The opening lyrics are:\n\n“बिना नयन के सुतल छै सिबगुरु\n\nमंदिर म घुस गेलै चोरवा”\n\n‘Lord Shiva was sleeping without his third eye,\n\nthe thieves took advantage and broke into the temple’.\n\nHis wife, goddess Parvati complains about the inconvenience that the theft of her jewels caused her, like any Angika speaking married woman would her husband.\n\nThis depiction of gods is in contrast to their usual glorious descriptions in scriptures. Here he sleeps like normal people, without his destruction-capable third-eye, and susceptible to robbery. In another song, Shiva is described as planting poppy on Ganga's riverside. It goes on to show that this folk culture mainly practiced by Dalit people — a group of people alienated from society by the caste system — has created versions of gods that are not set apart but share their lifestyle. The daily life of the divine couple living in the remote wilderness of Kailash is not very different from the laborer farmer living in the rocky terrain of a village in Banka, Bihar-imagined living inside the temple built for them there.\n\nPracticing oral culture in response to suppression of identity\n\nTorwali, an endangered language, had its identity repressed because of its ethnic and musical quality, emboldened itself with the Simam Festival 2011. This effort by Idara Baraye Taleem-o-Taraqi’s (IBT) is ethnography in action to safeguard identity against puritanical religious extremism that forbade this minority community from practicing their culture. The founder of IBT has made several new and old videos available on Commons.\n\nThe curious case of the meandering Kosi river\n\nFor example, ever since Sanjib Chaudhary documented a folk song in his mother tongue Eastern Tharu (a Nepali language), about a man who has to cross a big river to migrate to the next town, it has ignited in him the curiosity about the song’s link to Kosi river’s history. He is trying to establish the link between this folk song transmitted orally over generations and how it might relate to the change in the course of the river. He says:\n\nThis Tharu folk song details seasonal migration from Saptari to Morang describes a man needing to cross a dangerous Sursari/Saptari river (सुरसरी धारे); the singer, his beloved, warns him to stay. This ancient song, shared across four districts, omits mention of the much larger Kosi River, now on the same route. This absence is surprising, so I am doing research aimed at understanding Kosi's diversion history to see if Sursari was once the dominant river.\n\nVideo: “Morangesari folk song Eastern Tharu” by Sanjib Chaudhary, licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.\n\nSanjib’s case is an instance of how oral culture in the form of folk songs, oral history etc. can be living knowledge forms that can lead to a sense of identity, belonging, and intellectual curiosity towards one’s culture.\n\nIn practice: Agency over culture representation by underrepresented communities\n\nOral culture is connected to everyday realities from socioeconomic issues, historical events, to lifestyle shifts. These videos are uploaded on open knowledge platforms like Wikimedia Commons, Wikisource, and also linked to Wikipedia articles — an example is a recitation about Tulu folk heroes Koti and Chennayya added to this Wikipedia article. This is an example of inclusion of these previously orally transmitted knowledge onto mainstream knowledge platforms.\n\nDocumentation of these narratives by citizen archivists who are native speakers of the languages ensures that these are not excluded from the mainstream knowledge forms online, thus supporting epistemic and social justice. In addition, this decreases chances of unethical data collection because of their direct involvement in selection, recording, and sharing. Archiving these oral practices with camera phones has made the documentation process accessible to the practitioners of these cultures and the content is then available also to the speakers of these languages.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nIn many parts of South Asia, traditional stories, songs, and knowledge are passed down by speaking and singing rather than writing. These oral cultures, shared by farmers, minority groups, and local communities, are at risk of disappearing as modern life changes how people live and work.\n\n**What happened**\nA group of citizen archivists—regular people from 14 language communities—have started recording these oral traditions. They capture folk songs, riddles, and histories on video, then upload and transcribe them on Wikimedia platforms like Commons, Wikisource, and Wikipedia. This effort is part of a project called \"Enhancing Indic oral culture on Wikimedia projects.\" So far, they have saved 227 recordings that show everyday life, beliefs, and history from voices often left out of books and media.\n\n**Impact**\nThis work is important because it brings attention to cultures and languages that many people don’t know about. For example, Tulu farmers’ songs about planting crops are disappearing as farming changes. Angika folk songs show gods in everyday human roles, different from official religious stories. And videos from the Torwali community in Pakistan help protect their endangered language and culture. By sharing these stories openly online, the project helps keep these traditions alive and lets more people learn from them.\n\n**What’s next step**\nThe citizen archivists will continue recording and sharing oral cultures before they vanish. Researchers like Sanjib Chaudhary are also using folk songs to explore local history and nature, such as the changing path of a river. As more oral stories get linked to Wikipedia and other open platforms, these cultures will gain wider recognition and support.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nCitizen archivists in South Asia are preserving disappearing oral traditions by recording and sharing them on open online platforms, helping protect unique cultures and languages.\n",

      "title": "Our babies were taken after 'biased' parenting test - now we're fighting to get them back",
      "summary": "The Danish government has banned the use of parental competency tests, known as FKUs, on Greenlandic families after decades of criticism.",
      "content": "Our babies were taken after 'biased' parenting test - now we're fighting to get them back\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Sofia Bettiza, BBC Global Health Reporter and Woody Morris, BBC World Service, Denmark Share Save\n\nBBC Keira says she sobbed uncontrollably when her baby was taken away from her\n\nWhen Keira's daughter was born last November, she was given two hours with her before the baby was taken into care. \"Right when she came out, I started counting the minutes,\" Keira, 39, recalls. \"I kept looking at the clock to see how long we had.\" When the moment came for Zammi to be taken from her arms, Keira says she sobbed uncontrollably, whispering \"sorry\" to her baby. \"It felt like a part of my soul died.\" Now Keira is one of many Greenlandic families living on the Danish mainland who are fighting to get their children returned to them after they were removed by social services. In such cases, babies and children were taken away after parental competency tests - known in Denmark as FKUs - were used to help assess whether they were fit to be parents. In May this year the Danish government banned the use of these tests on Greenlandic families after decades of criticism, although they continue to be used on other families in Denmark. The assessments, which usually take months to complete, are used in complex welfare cases where authorities believe children are at risk of neglect or harm.\n\nKeira says she was \"counting the minutes\" from the moment Zammi was born, knowing she only had two hours with her daughter\n\nThey include interviews with parents and children, a range of cognitive tasks, such as recalling a sequence of numbers backwards, general knowledge quizzes, and personality and emotional testing. Defenders of the tests say they offer a more objective method of assessment than the potentially anecdotal and subjective evidence of social workers and other experts. But critics say they cannot meaningfully predict whether someone will make a good parent. Opponents have also long argued that they are designed around Danish cultural norms and point out they are administered in Danish, rather than Kalaallisut, the mother tongue of most Greenlanders. This can lead to misunderstandings, they say. Greenlanders are Danish citizens, enabling them to live and work on the mainland. Thousands live in Denmark, drawn by its employment opportunities, education and healthcare, among other reasons. Greenlandic parents in Denmark are 5.6 times more likely to have children taken into care than Danish parents, according to the Danish Centre for Social Research, a government-funded research institute. In May, the government said it hoped in due course to review around 300 cases – including ones involving FKU tests – in which Greenlandic children were forcibly removed from their families. But as of October, the BBC found that just 10 cases where parenting tests were used had been reviewed by the government - and no Greenlandic children had been returned as a result. Keira's assessment in 2024, carried out when she was pregnant, concluded that she did not have \"sufficient parental competencies to care for the newborn independently\". Keira says the questions she was asked included: \"Who is Mother Teresa?\" and \"How long does it take for the sun's rays to reach the Earth?\"\n\nKeira still keeps a cot beside her bed and another in the living room of her apartment, along with baby clothes and nappies\n\nPsychologists who defend the tests argue questions like these are intended to assess parents' general knowledge and their understanding of concepts they might encounter in society. Keira adds that \"they made me play with a doll and criticised me for not making enough eye contact\". She alleges that when she asked why she was being tested in this way the psychologist told her: \"To see if you are civilised enough, if you can act like a human being.\" The local authority in Keira's case said it could not comment on individual families, adding that decisions to place a child in care were made when there was serious concern about the \"child's health, development, and well-being\". In 2014, Keira's other two children - who were then aged nine years and eight months - were placed into care after an FKU test at the time concluded her parenting skills were not developing fast enough to meet their needs. Her eldest, Zoe, who is now 21, moved back home when she was 18 and currently lives in her own apartment and sees her mum regularly. Keira hopes she will soon be reunited with her baby Zammi permanently. The Danish government has said its review will look at whether mistakes were made in the administering of FKU tests on Greenlandic people. In the meantime, Keira is allowed to see Zammi, who is in foster care, once a week for an hour. Each time she visits, she takes flowers and sometimes Greenlandic food, such as chicken heart soup. \"Just so a little part of her culture can be with her,\" she says.\n\n'I felt the most horrific heartbreak'\n\nUlrik and Johanne hope the Danish government will reconsider reviewing cases like theirs where a child has been adopted\n\nBut not all Greenlandic parents who had children taken into care after completing FKUs will have their cases reviewed. Johanne and Ulrik's son was adopted in 2020 and the Danish government has said it will not review cases where children have been adopted. Johanne, 43, was tested in 2019 during pregnancy. Like Zammi, her son was meant to have been taken away immediately after birth. But because he was born prematurely on Boxing Day and social workers were on holiday, she and her husband Ulrik got to keep him for 17 days. \"It was the happiest time of my life as a father,\" says Ulrik, 57. \"Being with my son, holding him, changing his nappy, making sure that Johanne pumps her milk before going to bed in the evening.\" Then one day, two social workers and two police officers arrived at Johanne and Ulrik's home to take their son away. The couple say they pleaded with them not to take him. Johanne asked if she could breastfeed him one last time. \"As I was dressing my son to hand him over to his foster parents who were on their way, I felt the most horrific heartbreak,\" Ulrik says. Johanne had been tested after two children from another relationship, who were five and six, were taken into care after FKU testing in 2010. Her 2019 assessment describes her as \"narcissistic\" and as having \"mental retardation\" - a categorisation based on designations developed by the WHO which were in use at the time. She rejects both of these descriptions of her.\n\nGetty Images A protester carries a placard that reads: \"Our children are watching!! Prejudices are contagious,\" during a demonstration in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, earlier this year\n\nIn theory, there is no pass or fail mark for an FKU and they are one factor among others taken into consideration by local authorities who decide whether to place a child into care. But psychologist Isak Nellemann, who used to administer the tests, says in practice they \"are very important, about the most important thing, because when the tests are bad, in about 90% [of cases] they will lose their children\". Nelleman argues the tests lack scientific validity and were developed to study personality traits rather than predict parenting ability. However, Turi Frederiksen, a senior psychologist whose team currently administers the tests, defends them, saying that while they are not perfect, \"they are valuable, extensive psychological tools\". She also says she does not believe they are biased against Greenlanders. When Johanne was asked in 2019 what she saw during a Rorschach test - a psychological test where people are asked what they see when looking at ink-blot images - she said she saw a woman gutting a seal, a familiar sight in Greenland's hunting culture. Johanne alleges that on hearing this answer the psychologist called her a \"barbarian\". The local council involved in the couple's 2019 assessment did not address Johanne's claim directly. They said her assessment \"indicated significant concern regarding the parents' overall parenting abilities\" as well as \"concerns about the parents' general lifestyle and functional level in daily life\".\n\nSocial worker Tordis Jacobsen said the decision to place a child into care in Denmark was never taken lightly\n\n'I never got to see his first steps'\n\nAfter Johanne and Ulrik's son was taken into care, they were allowed to see him during brief, weekly visits until he was adopted in 2020. They have never seen him since. \"I never got to see his first steps, his first word, his first tooth, his first school day,\" Johanne says. However, a few days after his birth they christened him, creating an official record that includes their names and address. \"We needed to create a paper trail so he could find his way back to us,\" Johanne says. Their lawyer Jeanette Gjørret hopes to take their case before the European Court of Human Rights. But Denmark's social affairs minister Sophie Hæstorp Andersen tells the BBC the government will not reopen cases of adoption because each of these children is now settled with a \"loving and caring family\". Asked about the progress of the review, she says \"it sounds slow, but we are getting started\". She also says decisions to remove and adopt children are part of a \"very thorough process where we look into the family's ability to take care of their child not only for a year or two, but for a long period of time\". That is echoed by Tordis Jacobsen, a social worker team leader in Aalborg Kommune in northern Denmark, who says removing a child in Denmark is never taken lightly. She says safeguarding concerns are often first flagged by schools or hospitals, and points out that in cases where a child is permanently adopted the decision to approve this is made by a judge.\n\nPilinguaq's daughter, six, was returned to her several months ago, more than four years after being placed into care\n\nPilinguaq is a rare case of a Greenlandic mother who has been reunited with her child. She and her daughter, who was placed into care aged one, were reunited a few months ago. Her daughter is now six. Pilinguaq, 39, says she received the unexpected news in a phone call from social services. \"I started crying and laughing at the same time. I couldn't believe it. I kept thinking, 'Oh my God, she's coming home.'\" Pilinguaq's three children were all placed into care in 2021. The other two were aged six and nine at the time. She says she agreed for her local authority to place her children in temporary care while she found a new home suitable for her children. Pilinguaq says she believed her children would soon be returned to her, but instead she had to undergo a parenting assessment. This concluded she had a pattern of entering \"dysfunctional relationships\" and was unfit to parent.\n\n'They can take her in one hour'\n\nA few months after her six-year-old daughter came home, Pilinguaq was told by her local authority that her other two older children will be returning to her in December. The decision to return the children into Pilinguaq's care was made by the local authority rather than being recommended by the government review. The local authority declined to comment on her case. Spending more than four years apart has made it difficult for Pilinguaq to rebuild her relationship with her daughter. \"If I go to the bathroom and close the door, she will have a panic attack and say 'Mum, I couldn't find you,'\" Pilinguaq says. She also says she is terrified of losing her daughter again. \"They can take her in one hour. They can do it again.\"\n\nKeira has been making her daughter Zammi a wooden sleigh for her first birthday\n\nKeira is now preparing for Zammi's first birthday in her absence. She's building a traditional Greenlandic sleigh by hand from wood, with a polar bear drawn on the front. Earlier this month, she was told that her daughter won't be coming home - for now at least - but she hasn't given up hope. Keira still has a cot next to her bed and another in the living room, with framed photos of Zammi on the walls, along with baby clothes and nappies. \"I will not stop fighting for my children. \"If I don't finish this fight, it will be my children's fight in the future.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – For many years, Greenlandic families living in Denmark faced parenting tests called FKUs. These tests were used by social services to decide if parents were fit to care for their children. However, the tests were criticized for being unfair and biased because they were based on Danish culture and language, not Greenlandic traditions.\n\n**What happened** – In May 2024, the Danish government banned the use of FKUs on Greenlandic families after decades of complaints. These tests included memory tasks, general knowledge questions, and personality assessments, but critics argued they did not fairly judge Greenlandic parents. The government also promised to review about 300 cases where Greenlandic children were taken from their families after these tests.\n\n**Impact** – This decision is important because it addresses long-standing discrimination against Greenlandic families. Before the ban, Greenlandic parents were more than five times as likely as Danish parents to lose custody of their children. The tests often failed to consider Greenlandic language and culture, leading to unfair removals. The ban marks a step toward fairer treatment and respect for cultural differences.\n\n**What's next step** – The government is reviewing past cases where children were taken after FKUs were used, although progress has been slow. Some families are still fighting to get their children back, while others, whose children were adopted, are not included in the review.
