      "title": "Scientists finally explain statin muscle pain",
      "summary": "Statins are a cornerstone of heart health, but muscle pain and weakness cause many patients to quit taking them. Scientists have now identified the precise molecular trigger behind these side effects. They found that statins jam open a critical muscle protein, causing a toxic calcium leak. The discovery could lead to safer statins that keep their life-saving benefits without the muscle damage.",
      "content": "Statins have dramatically improved cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and cutting the risk of heart attacks and strokes for millions of people. Despite these benefits, many patients experience unwanted side effects. These can include muscle pain and weakness, and in rare situations, a dangerous breakdown of muscle tissue that can lead to kidney failure.\n\nScientists at the University of British Columbia, working with collaborators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, have now identified what triggers these muscle-related problems. Their research, published in Nature Communications, points toward a path for developing safer statins that do not cause these complications.\n\nHow Statins Interact With Muscle Cells\n\nTo uncover the mechanism, the researchers turned to cryo-electron microscopy, an advanced imaging method that allows scientists to see proteins in near-atomic detail. Using this technique, they observed how statins interact with a key muscle protein known as the ryanodine receptor (RyR1).\n\nThis protein regulates the flow of calcium inside muscle cells, acting as a gate that opens only when muscles need to contract. The researchers found that when statins bind to RyR1, they force the channel into an open position. This causes calcium to leak continuously, which can be toxic to muscle tissue and lead to damage.\n\n\"We were able to see, almost atom by atom, how statins latch onto this channel,\" said lead author Dr. Steven Molinarolo, a postdoctoral researcher in UBC's department of biochemistry and molecular biology. \"That leak of calcium explains why some patients experience muscle pain or, in extreme cases, life-threatening complications.\"\n\nA Unique Binding Pattern Revealed\n\nThe study focused on atorvastatin, one of the most commonly prescribed statins worldwide. However, the researchers believe the same mechanism may apply to other drugs in the statin family.\n\nThey discovered that statins bind to the ryanodine receptor in an unusual way. Three statin molecules cluster together inside a pocket of the protein. The first molecule binds while the channel is closed, setting the stage for it to open. Two additional molecules then lodge into place, forcing the channel fully open.\n\n\"This is the first time we've had a clear picture of how statins activate this channel,\" said Dr. Filip Van Petegem, senior author and professor at UBC's Life Sciences Institute. \"It's a big step forward because it gives us a roadmap for designing statins that don't interact with muscle tissue.\"\n\nToward Safer Cholesterol Drugs\n\nBy modifying only the parts of the statin molecule responsible for these harmful interactions, researchers may be able to keep the cholesterol-lowering benefits while reducing the risk of muscle damage.\n\nSevere muscle injury affects only a small percentage of the more than 200 million statin users worldwide. However, milder symptoms such as soreness and fatigue are far more common and often cause patients to stop taking the medication. The new findings could help reduce these side effects and encourage patients to stay on treatments that protect their heart health.\n\nAdvanced Imaging Drives Medical Breakthroughs\n\nThe study highlights how cutting-edge imaging tools are transforming medical research. Using the UBC faculty of medicine's high-resolution macromolecular cryo-electron microscopy facility, the team captured the statin-protein interaction in exceptional detail, turning a long-standing safety question into actionable scientific insight that could shape future therapies.\n\n\"Statins have been a cornerstone of cardiovascular care for decades,\" Dr. Van Petegem said. \"Our goal is to make them even safer, so patients can benefit without fear of serious side effects.\"\n\nFor the millions of people who depend on statins, these advances could translate into fewer muscle problems and a better overall quality of life.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Statins are medicines that many people take to lower cholesterol and protect their hearts. But some patients stop using them because they feel muscle pain or weakness, which can sometimes be very serious.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from the University of British Columbia and the University of Wisconsin-Madison used a special microscope to look closely at how statins affect muscle cells. They found that statins open a muscle protein called the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) in a way that causes harmful calcium leaks inside muscle cells. This leak can cause muscle pain and damage.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery explains why muscle problems happen with statin use and shows exactly how the drugs cause this side effect. Knowing this, scientists can now try to change statins so they still lower cholesterol but don’t harm muscles. Since millions of people take statins, safer versions could help many avoid muscle pain and keep protecting their hearts.\n\n**What’s next step** – Researchers will work on designing new statin medicines that avoid opening the muscle protein too much. Future studies will test these improved drugs to make sure they are both safe for muscles and effective at lowering cholesterol.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scientists have found the exact way statins cause muscle pain, opening the door to safer heart medicines without muscle side effects.",

      "title": "A quiet change in everyday foods could save thousands of lives",
      "summary": "Lowering salt in everyday foods could quietly save lives. Researchers found that modest sodium reductions in bread, packaged foods, and takeout meals could significantly reduce heart disease and stroke rates in France and the U.K. The key advantage is that people would not need to alter their eating habits at all. Small changes to the food supply could deliver large, long-term health benefits.",
      "content": "Lowering sodium levels in packaged and prepared foods could lead to major improvements in heart health and prevent large numbers of heart attacks, strokes, and premature deaths in France and the United Kingdom. That is the conclusion of two new studies published in Hypertension, a journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nIn France, researchers found that cutting salt in baguettes and other widely eaten breads could lower daily sodium intake by about 0.35 grams per person. Over time, this small shift could help prevent more than 1,000 deaths nationwide, highlighting how modest changes in staple foods can have powerful health effects.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a separate analysis estimated that meeting the country's 2024 sodium reduction goals could reduce average daily salt intake by 17.5%. That drop in sodium could help prevent roughly 100,000 cases of ischemic heart disease and about 25,000 ischemic strokes over a 20 year period by lowering blood pressure across the population.\n\nTogether, the studies underscore the impact of coordinated action among governments, food manufacturers, and public health leaders. Strengthening and enforcing sodium reduction efforts worldwide could deliver lasting improvements in heart health, researchers said.\n\nSmall Food Changes With Large Public Health Impact\n\nEating too much sodium is a leading contributor to hypertension, also known as high blood pressure. According to the American Heart Association, high blood pressure raises the risk of serious conditions including heart attack, stroke, chronic kidney disease, dementia, and other cardiovascular diseases.\n\nBecause excessive sodium consumption is a widespread public health issue, many countries have adopted salt reduction policies. Sodium, which is found in salt, is commonly consumed through everyday foods. Reducing salt intake at a population level is seen as a way to improve long-term health outcomes while lowering health care costs.\n\nThe new research includes two modeling studies. One was conducted in France and focused on planned sodium reductions in baguettes and other bread products by 2025. The second examined sodium reduction goals set for 2024 in the United Kingdom, targeting packaged foods and takeaway meals.\n\nBoth studies estimated what could happen if these sodium targets were fully met. The projections suggest that small reductions in sodium levels across commonly eaten foods could produce meaningful public health benefits. Importantly, these changes would not require people to alter their eating habits.\n\n\"This approach is particularly powerful because it does not rely on individual behavior change, which is often difficult to achieve and sustain. Instead, it creates a healthier food environment by default,\" said Clémence Grave, M.D., lead author of the French study and an epidemiologist and public health physician at the French National Public Health Agency in Saint-Maurice near Paris.\n\nThe World Health Organization advises adults to consume less than 2,000 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day, although average intake worldwide remains much higher. The American Heart Association recommends a maximum of 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day, which is about 1 teaspoon of table salt. It also notes that an ideal intake is no more than 1,500 mg per day for most adults, particularly those with high blood pressure.\n\nSodium Reduction in Bread (France)\n\nIn 2019, France established a national goal to reduce salt consumption by 30%. This effort led to a voluntary agreement in 2022 between the government and bread producers to lower salt levels in bread by 2025. Bread, especially the baguette, is a staple in French diets but also a major source of salt, traditionally accounting for about 25% of the recommended daily intake. By 2023, most bread produced in France already met the new sodium standards.\n\nTo assess the potential health effects of this agreement, researchers used national data and a mathematical model. They estimated how many cases of cardio-cerebrovascular disease (conditions and diseases that affect both the heart and the brain's blood vessels), kidney disease, and dementia could be avoided if the sodium targets were fully achieved.\n\nThe analysis showed that if bread consumption remained unchanged and sodium targets were met, daily salt intake would drop by 0.35 g per person. This reduction would lead to modest but meaningful decreases in blood pressure across the population.\n\nEstimated Health Benefits in France\n\nUnder a scenario of full compliance, the researchers estimated that:\n\nAnnual deaths would decline by 0.18% (by 1,186).\n\nHospitalizations for ischemic heart disease would decrease by 1.04%.\n\nHospitalizations for hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke would fall by 1.05% and 0.88% respectively.\n\nMen would see the largest overall benefits, with 0.87% of heart disease and stroke cases prevented compared with 0.63% among women. Among women, the greatest avoidable proportion occurred in those ages 55 to 64 years old.\n\n\"This salt-reduction measure went completely unnoticed by the French population -- no one realized that bread contained less salt,\" Grave said. \"Our findings show that reformulating food products, even with small, invisible changes, can have a significant impact on public health.\"\n\n\"These results highlight the need for collaboration between policymakers, industry and health care professionals,\" she added. \"By combining individual counseling with population-level strategies, we can achieve greater reductions in cardiovascular risk and improve long-term health.\"\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings depend on modeling assumptions and available data. \"It is impossible to directly measure the isolated impact of reducing salt in bread because this change over time occurs alongside other factors, such as behavioral modifications or variations in bread consumption, which cannot be fully estimated here,\" Grave explained.\n\nThe analysis also examined outcomes for a single year. Longer-term projections would require additional assumptions and data sources.\n\nSodium Reduction in Packaged Foods and Take-out Meals (United Kingdom)\n\nFor the U.K. study, researchers analyzed national survey data to estimate how much salt people consume from packaged foods and takeaway meals. They then calculated how sodium intake would change if all relevant food categories met the country's 2024 sodium reduction targets.\n\nSales-weighted average and maximum salt limits were established for 84 grocery food categories, including bread, cheeses, meats, and snacks. For the first time, the targets also included 24 out-of-home food categories such as burgers, curries, and pizza. The modeling evaluated potential effects on heart disease, stroke, quality of life, and health care costs.\n\nIf the targets were fully met, average daily salt intake would have fallen from about 6.1 g to 4.9 g. This represents an estimated 17.5% reduction per person. Men were projected to experience slightly larger decreases than women because they generally consume more salt.\n\nEven these modest daily reductions were expected to slightly lower blood pressure across the population, with benefits accumulating over time.\n\nLong-Term Health and Cost Benefits in the U.K.\n\nOver a 20-year period, the model estimated that approximately 103,000 cases of ischemic heart disease and about 25,000 strokes could be prevented in the U.K.\n\nAcross lifetimes, the associated reductions in blood pressure were projected to generate roughly 243,000 additional quality-adjusted life years (a standard measure of health benefit) and save £1 billion (about $1.3 billion in U.S. dollars) for the National Health Service.\n\nThe findings aligned with expectations, researchers said. \"We know that cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the U.K. -- as it is worldwide -- so any reductions in salt intake and blood pressure could lead to big benefits,\" said Lauren Bandy, D.Phil., lead author of the U.K. study and a researcher in food and population health at the University of Oxford in Oxford, England. \"We also know that the food industry still has a lot of progress to make when it comes to salt reduction, so there's a lot of room for improvement.\"\n\n\"If U.K. food companies had fully met the 2024 salt reduction targets, the resulting drop in salt intake across the population could have prevented tens of thousands of heart attacks and strokes, saved substantially in health costs and significantly improved public health,\" she said, \"all without requiring people to change their eating habits. Strengthening and enforcing salt reduction policies both in the U.K. and globally could unlock these benefits.\"\n\nThe researchers noted that some data on salt levels in foods may not fully reflect changes made closer to 2024. In addition, the dietary survey data relied on self-reported intake, which can underestimate sodium consumption, particularly from restaurant and takeaway foods.\n\nRelevance for the United States and Beyond\n\nDaniel W. Jones, M.D., FAHA, chair of the 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology High Blood Pressure Guideline and dean and professor emeritus at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine in Jackson, Mississippi, said the findings have broad relevance.\n\n\"Both of these modelling studies demonstrate the potential benefit in reducing risk for heart disease and stroke by reducing sodium consumption,\" he said. \"This 'national' approach to limiting salt content in commercially prepared foods is a key strategy for countries where a major part of food consumption is from foods prepared outside the home. Though sodium reduction makes small improvements in blood pressure at the individual level, these small changes in individuals result in major improvements in a large population.\"\n\nStudy Details: France\n\nAverage daily salt intake in France was 8.1 g per day in 2015, with more than 90% of adults exceeding recommended levels. Traditional French bread and baguettes contained about 1.7 g of salt per 100 g, contributing roughly 2 g per person per day, or about 25% of total intake.\n\nFrance set a goal to reduce salt intake by 30% and reached a voluntary agreement with the bakery sector in March 2022 to progressively reduce salt levels in all breads by 2025.\n\nResearchers modeled expected reductions in systolic blood pressure and related health outcomes under a scenario of full compliance with sodium targets. The analysis accounted for different blood pressure responses among people with and without hypertension.\n\nThe model used systolic blood pressure data for adults ages 35 and older and salt intake data from a 2014-2016 national survey. Salt intake was estimated based on three 24-hour dietary recalls and combined with 2022 data from the national claims database, which includes information on hospitalizations, outpatient care, and mortality within France's health care system.\n\nStudy Details: United Kingdom\n\nThe U.K. modeling focused on the adult population and examined the impact of sodium reduction on ischemic heart disease, stroke, quality-adjusted life years, and health care costs.\n\nResearchers used daily salt intake data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey conducted in 2018-2019 to estimate changes if sodium targets were met in 2024. The survey collects food intake data from a representative sample of about 1,000 people using three- to four-day food diaries.\n\nThe study sample included 586 adults ages 18 and older, weighted to reflect the U.K. population based on 2017 estimates. Participants reported consuming 2,549 unique foods, with 1,532 of those matched to sodium reduction target categories.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Los científicos han estudiado durante mucho tiempo cuánto viven las personas y qué afecta la duración de la vida. Se sabía que los genes tenían un papel, pero estudios anteriores decían que sólo representaban entre el 10 y el 25 por ciento de la razón por la que algunas personas viven más tiempo que otras.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Un nuevo estudio publicado en la revista Science analizó datos de gemelos y hermanos que datan desde el siglo XIX en Dinamarca, Suecia y Estados Unidos. Separando cuidadosamente las muertes causadas por factores externos como accidentes de las causadas por el envejecimiento interno del cuerpo, los investigadores encontraron que alrededor del 55 por ciento de la duración de la vida está determinada por los genes.\n\n**Impacto** – Este es un papel mucho mayor para los genes de lo que se pensaba antes. Esto significa que entender los genes específicos que influyen en el envejecimiento podría ayudar a crear tratamientos para desacelerar el envejecimiento y prevenir enfermedades relacionadas con la edad. Este estudio cambia nuestra forma de pensar sobre el envejecimiento y abre nuevas posibilidades para la investigación médica.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos ahora se enfocarán en identificar los genes exactos que ayudan a las personas a envejecer saludablemente. Esto podría llevar a nuevos medicamentos o terapias que mejoren la duración y calidad de vida. Se podrían hacer más estudios para ver cómo los genes interactúan con el estilo de vida y el ambiente.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Más de la mitad de la duración de la vida de las personas depende de sus genes, ofreciendo nueva esperanza para tratamientos que atacan el envejecimiento mismo.",

      "content": "Unconsciousness induced by the widely used drug propofol is marked by characteristic changes in electrical activity. Credit: Abed Zagout/Anadolu/Getty\n\nScientists have identified a distinctive brain-wave pattern that marks the slide into unconsciousness during general anaesthesia. If the finding is confirmed, this pattern could help doctors to avoid sedating patients too deeply — or not deeply enough.\n\nThe data were collected from people about to have surgery. They show that as anaesthesia takes hold, the interplay between several brain areas falters. This shift could serve as a biomarker — a quantifiable biological measure — of loss of consciousness, the authors write today in Cell Reports Medicine1.\n\n“This will finally provide the possibility [of] a translatable biomarker,” says co-author Ti-Fei Yuan, a neuroscientist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.\n\nBut, Yuan acknowledges, the study assesses the effects of only one anaesthetic and relies on a new technique to infer brain-wide signals from data recorded from outside the skull.\n\nGoing under\n\nScientists have long sought non-behavioural correlates of consciousness. Anaesthesiologists could use such signatures to fine-tune drug dosing and avoid the complications and side-effects of over- and under-sedation.\n\nTo seek such a marker, Yuan and his colleagues studied 31 people who received the widely used drug propofol as a general anaesthetic before surgery.\n\nThe consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?\n\nThe authors placed 128 electrodes on each participant’s scalp to record the underlying neurons’ electrical activity from many positions. They then used emerging mathematical methods to isolate signals originating from nine brain regions previously implicated in mediating consciousness and examined connections between pairs of these regions. Among them were the parietal cortex, which is at the top of the brain about halfway between the forehead and the back of the skull; the occipital cortex, at the back of the head; and several small, deeper structures, such as one called the thalamus.\n\nBefore the propofol was administered, an oscillating brain wave called an alpha-band wave was highly synchronized between the parietal area and the thalamus. This correlation was a sign that these areas are in close communication in the awake brain. The researchers also saw signs of high connectivity between the parietal and occipital areas in the unsedated brain.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – When people have surgery, doctors use anesthesia to make them unconscious and avoid pain. But it can be hard to know exactly when a person loses awareness during this process. Finding a clear signal in the brain would help doctors give just the right amount of anesthesia.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers studied 31 patients who were given the common anesthesia drug propofol before surgery. They placed 128 small sensors on each patient’s head to measure brain activity. They focused on nine brain areas linked to consciousness and found that before anesthesia, certain brain regions communicated in a clear, synchronized pattern. As anesthesia took effect, this connection broke down, showing a specific brain-wave pattern that signals the loss of consciousness.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it offers a measurable brain signal – called a biomarker – that could help doctors know exactly when a patient becomes unconscious. This could prevent giving too much anesthesia, which can be harmful, or too little, which might cause pain or awareness during surgery. Although the study tested only one drug and used new techniques, it sets the stage for safer and more precise anesthesia care.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will need to confirm this brain-wave pattern with other anesthesia drugs and in more patients. They will also refine the technology to make it easier to use in hospitals. If successful, this could lead to new monitoring tools that improve patient safety during many types of surgery.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Researchers have identified a clear brain signal that shows when anesthesia causes loss of consciousness, paving the way for safer surgeries.",
