      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn a landmark win for wildlife lovers and conservationists, Scotland will now require swift bricks to be installed in all new buildings, a move aimed at reversing the steep decline of swifts and other endangered cavity-nestingbirds.\n\nMembers of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) voted to support an amendment by Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell, making the bird-friendly bricks mandatory in all new dwellings where “reasonably practical and appropriate.” The law positions Scotland at the forefront of UK efforts to support threatened urban bird species.\n\n“Swifts join our communities every summer, but they are becoming rarer everywhere,” Ruskell said. “I’m looking forward to seeing every new building in Scotland host a family of swifts in the future.”\n\nWhat are swift bricks?\n\nSwift bricks are specially designed nesting bricks that are built directly into the walls of new homes. On the outside, they look almost identical to standard facing bricks, but inside, they contain a hollow chamber with a small entrance hole where birds can safely nest.\n\nBecause they’re part of the structure, they don’t fall down in storms, don’t need regular maintenance like external nest boxes, and can last as long as the building itself. Installed high on walls and away from windows, they provide long-term, predator-safe nesting spaces for swifts and other cavity-nesting birds.\n\nWhy this matters for birds and biodiversity\n\nSwifts are remarkable birds. They travel thousands of miles from Africa each year to nest in the UK, often returning to the exact same spot. But in recent decades, their numbers have plunged by 60 percent since 1995, largely due to the loss of natural nesting spaces caused by modern construction and renovation practices.\n\n“These iconic species were once a common sight across Scotland,” said Minister Gillian Martin during the Holyrood debate, “but they are under threat. I welcome practical ways to protect this species and improve biodiversity.”\n\nSwifts and other cavity-nesting birds such as sparrows, starlings, and house martins have lost millions of nesting sites as old roofs are sealed during renovations and insulation upgrades. Swift bricks offer a discreet and effective solution. Installed directly into walls, they provide safe, long-lasting nesting spots for birds without altering building aesthetics.\n\nA contrast to England’s cautious approach\n\nWhile Scotland has acted swiftly (no pun intended), efforts to mandate swift bricks in England have met resistance. The Labour government rejected a similar amendment last year, choosing instead to include swift bricks in planning guidance. But because it isn’t legally binding, developers aren’t required to use them, which means that many don’t.\n\nCritics argue that guidance alone won’t do enough. Hannah Bourne-Taylor, a national advocate for swift bricks, called Scotland’s move a “landmark victory” and urged the rest of the UK to follow suit. “To save Britain’s swifts, with fewer than 40,000 pairs remaining, England, Wales and Northern Ireland must follow Scotland’s lead,” she said. “You can’t offer toothless guidance and expect real results.”\n\nEven when boxes or bricks are technically required, enforcement can be weak. A University of Sheffield study found that 75 percent of bird and bat boxes mandated as part of planning conditions had not been installed by the time construction was finished.\n\nWhat’s next: setting the standard\n\nBefore implementation, Scotland will carry out a 12-month consultation to ensure building standards are appropriate for widespread use of swift bricks. The measure isn’t just for swifts. It’s a broader win for urban biodiversity.\n\nLord Goldsmith, who has tabled legislation in the House of Lords to mandate swift bricks, praised the Scottish approach. “It’s only taken Scotland one month to decide to mandate swift bricks, proving how easy it would be for England to finally do the same,” he said.\n\nA global model in the making\n\nOther regions have already seen the benefits. In Gibraltar, a key stopover on the swifts’ long migration between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, swift bricks have been required for decades. According to Professor John Cortes, Gibraltar’s environment minister, the result has been a stabilized and now increasing population of swifts.\n\n“Scotland’s decision is a significant step in ensuring the survival of this species, which has come to depend so much on us,” Cortes said.\n\nAlthough Wales rejected swift bricks last year, claiming developers might use them to avoid other nature-positive requirements, conservationists insist these small measures are an essential part of a much larger solution.\n\nAnd in urban areas where natural nesting spaces are disappearing fast, swift bricks offer a simple, scalable fix that turns everyday homes into safe havens for birds.\n\nDid this solution stand out?

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Swifts are small birds that travel long distances to nest in the UK each year. Over the last few decades, their numbers have dropped sharply because modern buildings often block their natural nesting spots.\n\n**What happened** – Scotland’s Parliament has passed a new rule requiring all new homes to include swift bricks. These special bricks have built-in spaces where swifts and similar birds can safely nest. This law applies where it is practical and helps make sure birds have safe places to live.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time a UK nation has made swift bricks mandatory in new buildings. Swift bricks last as long as the building and don’t need extra care like bird boxes. This change can help stop the decline of swifts, which have lost many natural nesting sites. Other parts of the UK, like England, have only suggested using swift bricks but not required them.\n\n**What's next step** – Scotland will spend a year consulting experts and builders to make sure the rule works well. This law could inspire other UK countries to adopt similar measures and help protect more urban wildlife.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Scotland is leading the UK by requiring new homes to include swift bricks, giving endangered birds safe places to nest and helping their populations recover.",

      "content": "Think about your favorite hiking jacket with a torn pocket, or the backpack with a broken zipper that’s traveled with you to so many National Parks. Maybe your boots have carried you for thousands of miles but now need new soles. Before you throw them away, consider the many outdoor gear brands that now offer repair programs to help give your well-loved equipment a second life.\n\nFixing your gear instead of buying new is one of the best ways outdoor lovers can help the environment. The textile and apparel industry creates 8-10% of global carbon emissions, which is more than international aviation and shipping combined.\n\nMaking just one polyester jacket produces about 5.5 kg (12.13 lbs.) of CO2. By repairing your jacket instead of replacing it, you save money, reduce the need to produce polyester from oil, cut down on manufacturing emissions, and keep useful materials out of landfills.\n\nThe Environmental Case for Repair\n\nResearch from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation shows that $500 billion is lost each year because clothes are barely worn and rarely recycled. In 2025, people bought 60% more clothing than in 2000, but each item was kept for only half as long. This fast-fashion mindset has even reached outdoor gear, even though technical apparel is made to last.\n\nIf you use a product for just 3 more months, you can reduce its carbon, water, and waste impacts by 10%. Big outdoor brands have noticed this. For example, Arc’teryx says its ReBird repair program saved over 30,000 kg of carbon in one year. Patagonia also runs one of the largest repair centers in North America, fixing tens of thousands of items each year through its Worn Wear program.\n\nThe circular economy, in which products are made to be repaired, reused, and eventually recycled instead of thrown away, is becoming more popular in the outdoor industry. More brands are designing gear that’s easier to fix, with parts that can be swapped out and materials that hold up to repeated repairs.\n\nWhat Can Be Repaired?\n\nMost outdoor gear repair programs fix the usual problems that come from regular use. For example, technical jackets can be upgraded with waterproof patches for rips, zippers replaced, waterproofing reapplied, and seam repairs. Backpacks often need new buckles, hardware, strap repairs, or zipper fixes. Tents might need pole repairs, new zippers, or patches. Footwear can be resoled, new straps added to the upper, or the hardware replaced.\n\nSome repairs are simple enough to do yourself. For example, Patagonia works with iFixit to offer over 100 repair guides for their products. You can often replace zipper pulls, add patches, or clean and reproof waterproof gear at home if you have the right instructions and materials.\n\nOutdoor Brands with Repair Programs\n\nPatagonia Worn Wear\n\nPatagonia’s Worn Wear program, launched in 2013, set the standard for outdoor gear repair. The company operates one of North America’s largest garment repair facilities and will attempt to fix any Patagonia product for a $15 round-trip shipping fee. Repairs include fabric, stitching, buckles, zippers, and more for apparel, packs, jackets, snow gear, waders, and wetsuits. If an item can’t be repaired, Patagonia will recycle it. The company also offers mobile repair tours, bringing sewing machines to stores and events for free on-site repairs.\n\nArc’teryx ReBird\n\nArc’teryx’s ReBird platform encompasses care, repair, resale, and upcycling initiatives. The program operates service centers in New York, Vancouver, Toronto, Beijing, Tokyo, Boulder, and London, with plans to expand to 25 stores globally. Services include complimentary on-site assessments, GORE-TEX washing and reproofing, zipper repairs, buckle replacements, and fabric patching. In 2023, Arc’teryx completed over 20,000 repairs and achieved a 127% increase in resale revenue through the program.\n\nThe North Face Renewed\n\nThe North Face Renewed program accepts used gear through online trade-ins or in-store drop-offs, offering $10-$50 in credit depending on item condition. Products are inspected, cleaned, and repaired before being resold through the Renewed online store. The brand’s Warranty & Repairs Department has operated since 1969, repairing approximately 40,000 items per year. Items that can’t be repaired are recycled or donated. The company has also launched circular design initiatives, training designers to create products that can be more easily repaired and recycled.\n\nOsprey’s All Mighty Guarantee\n\nOsprey’s All Mighty Guarantee is among the most comprehensive in the industry, promising to repair any damage or defect for any reason, free of charge, regardless of when the product was purchased—whether in 1974 or yesterday. Customers pay only for shipping to Osprey; the company covers repair costs and return shipping. If a pack can’t be repaired, Osprey will replace it. The program covers torn fabric, worn-out buckles, broken zippers, and virtually any other damage. Replacement parts are also available if you want to do DIY repairs yourself.\n\nREI Co-op\n\nREI offers in-house repair services for outerwear, tents, sleeping bags, and more, with expert technicians who can fix items from any brand. The venerable co-op also provides extensive care and repair guides through its Expert Advice page. REI’s Re/Supply program allows members to trade in used gear for store credit, and items are either resold at a discount or recycled. The company partners with third-party repair specialists for more complex work.\n\nLOWA Boots\n\nLOWA offers resoling and repair services for its backpacking, mountaineering, and hunting boots. In the U.S., repairs are handled by Daub’s Cobbler Shop in New Hampshire, which received factory training in Germany. Services include resoling (for cemented construction boots like the Tibet GTX, Camino GTX, and Ranger GTX), heel renewal, seam repair, heel lining repair, and hook replacement. Resoling includes new footbeds, laces, and leather reconditioning. We can attest from personal experience, that there is nothing like feeling a familiar and improved boot back on your feet after a repair.\n\nDanner Recrafting\n\nDanner’s Recrafting program, in Portland, Oregon, can restore boots to like-new condition. Services range from basic resoling ($100) to complete rebuilds ($280+) that include new midsoles, outsoles, heel counters, shanks, liners, and hardware. Craftspeople recondition leather uppers, repair stitching, and finish boots with new laces. The program covers over 150 different Danner models, including the Mountain 600 series. Turnaround time is typically 5-6 weeks.\n\nChaco’s ReChaco\n\nChaco’s ReChaco program operates out of Rockford, Michigan, and offers lifetime repairs for Z-series sandals. Services include resoling, strap replacement (with options to customize colors and patterns), buckle replacement, strap length adjustment, and toe tightening. The program has repaired over 323,000 pairs of sandals since its inception, keeping them out of landfills. The average turnaround time is about two weeks after the sandals are received.\n\nDeuter Pack Repair\n\nDeuter’s Promise guarantees free repairs on any Deuter pack, regardless of age or reason for damage. The company will attempt to repair any pack and, if deemed irreparable, will replace it with the closest comparable model at no cost. Repairs are performed in Boulder, Colorado. Deuter also sends replacement parts to customers for DIY fixes when possible, including buckles and patches. Peak season turnaround is 8-12 weeks; off-season repairs are faster.\n\nCotopaxi is Guaranteed for Good\n\nCotopaxi’s Guaranteed for Good program covers manufacturing defects for the lifetime of the product and offers repair services even for damage outside warranty coverage. The company provides DIY patches for small holes, in-store repair assistance at Cotopaxi retail locations, and partners with Rugged Thread for extensive repairs requiring deconstruction and reconstruction. Cotopaxi also partners with ThredUp on its Mas Vida resale platform for pre-loved gear, and accepts trade-ins for store credit.\n\nFjällräven\n\nFjällräven offers repair services at its flagship retail locations and through a mail-in program for customers who don’t live near its stores. The company provides a Limited Lifetime Warranty covering manufacturing defects and will assess items for repair throughout the product’s lifetime. Flagship stores have in-store tailors who can perform repairs on the spot. Fjällräven also operates a Takeback Program at select stores, offering $10-$25 vouchers for used gear kept out of landfills.\n\nNEMO Equipment\n\nNEMO repairs nearly all of its products at two U.S. facilities and two third-party facilities in Canada and Europe, so you don’t have to ship your fixer-uppers halfway around the world. From repaneling tents to replacing sleeping bag valves, the repairs take four to six weeks. Unlike many brands, NEMO offers comprehensive hardgoods repairs in addition to softgoods. The company also sends replacement parts with how-to tutorials for DIY repairs. The company recommends sending gear during the off-season for faster service.\n\nBig Agnes\n\nBig Agnes’s repair team patches tent tears, straightens poles, fixes zippers, and addresses other common issues with camping gear. In 2022, the team repaired gear for more than 6,000 customers and shipped 1,500 parts for DIY repairs. The company also operates a Used Gear Trade-In program where customers can send in old Big Agnes gear for credit toward new purchases; traded items are recycled, converted to repair parts, or donated. Most zipper repairs cost $20 per door.\n\nRab\n\nRab’s Service Center provides washes and repairs for Rab gear in the USA, UK, Netherlands, and Canada, completing over 22,000 repairs in 2024. The Second Stitch program uses end-of-life fabric rolls and offcuts in contrasting colors for repairs, reducing environmental impact while giving gear a distinctive patched look. Repair costs typically range from $10 to $55. Rab also offers gear rental programs as an alternative to purchasing new equipment.\n\nMountain Hardwear\n\nMountain Hardwear’s Repair Over Replace program aims to fix gear whenever possible rather than replacing it. Customers can submit gear for inspection by experts, who assess whether repair is feasible. The company believes their gear is worth more on the mountain than in a landfill and has structured their warranty and repair services to maximize product lifespan.\n\nThird-Party Repair Services\n\nIn addition to brand-specific programs, several independent repair shops specialize in outdoor gear.\n\nRugged Thread in Bend, Oregon, works with over 30 outdoor companies and offers repairs on all four seasons of outdoor clothing, tents, backpacks, and technical gear.\n\nGear re-Store operates repair centers in Denver, Calgary, and Philadelphia, partnering with brands including Patagonia, The North Face, and Norrøna.\n\nRainy Pass Repair in Seattle has over 30 years of experience and offers comprehensive tent, sleeping bag, and outerwear repairs, including down refilling and DWR reapplication.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nBefore you send your gear in for repair, make sure to clean it well. Most brands will either turn away dirty gear or charge extra to clean it. Take photos of the damage and check the brand’s website for any special instructions.\n\nMany companies have online forms to help you start the repair process and get shipping details. If you want to fix things yourself, brands like Patagonia and NEMO have detailed guides and offer patch kits and replacement parts. Simple repairs, like adding waterproofing, replacing zipper pulls, or patching small holes, can often be done at home with products like Gear Aid’s Tenacious Tape or NoSo Patches.\n\nRepair Is Reuse That Lowers Your Impact\n\nEach time you repair a jacket, resole your boots, or patch a tent, you help save resources and cut down on emissions.\n\nThe outdoor industry’s growing focus on repair programs shows that both the environment and customers want products that last. By using these services, you can lower your environmental impact and keep your favorite gear going for years, or even decades, longer than if you just threw it away.\n\nSo, the next time your gear starts to wear out, see if the manufacturer offers repairs before you buy something new. Your well-used equipment could still have plenty of adventures ahead.",

      "title": "What happens when a neighborhood is built around a farm",
      "summary": "",
      "content": "Picture the bucolic little town of a fairy tale. At its core stand medieval buildings, a square where folks hawk their goods, and perhaps a well to provide water. Beyond the defensive wall radiate agricultural fields, where people toil to bring grains, fruits, and vegetables to market.\n\nInvert that for modern times and you’ve got the idea behind “agrihoods,” communities designed around a central farm. Like a garden in a big city, agrihoods promise to boost food security, reduce temperatures, capture rainwater, and increase biodiversity. As climate change intensifies heat, flooding, and pressure on food systems, agrihoods could be a way to make urban living more resilient — not just more picturesque.\n\n“Developers have a hard time offering open space, because they would like to build more housing,” said Vincent Mudd, a partner at the architectural firm Steinberg Hart, which designs agrihoods. “One of the few ways to kind of bridge that gap is to be able to use active open space that actually generates commerce.”\n\nOn paper, an agrihood is a simple concept: a working farm surrounded by single- or multifamily housing. Steinberg Hart recently finished two of them in California — one in Santa Clara and another, called Fox Point Farms, in Encinitas. The former, south of San Francisco, features townhouses, market-rate units, and affordable housing, plus a community center and retail shops. The latter, north of San Diego, adds a farm-to-table restaurant, an event venue, and a grocery store, but its housing is primarily for sale instead of rent. “Two different housing programs for two different communities, but built around the sustainability of urban farming,” Mudd said.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nWhile these projects are in relatively affluent areas, Mudd said agrihoods can be built nearly anywhere — though it might require tweaks to zoning rules. “Almost every city has the ability to make that zoning change,” Mudd said, “because it retains commerce, preserves jobs, generates sales tax income from retail, and provides mixed-income, attainable housing.”\n\nA view of the Fox Point Farms agrihood in Encinitas, California.\n\nKyle Jeffers\n\n(Last year, residents of the agrihood development in Santa Clara alleged that management failures have left them living in unsafe and unhealthy conditions, with delayed repairs, poor air quality, and other issues. The building’s manager, the John Stewart Co., and owner, Core Affordable, did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nWhere it gets more complicated is the logistics of the farm. Water is the big one: Ideally a farm captures enough rainwater to keep crops hydrated. Because Northern California enjoys a Mediterranean climate of rainy winters and warm, dry summers, the Santa Clara agrihood gathers precipitation and stores it in a tower. “It auto-refills with city water once it gets to a certain point, but we can get two-thirds, or sometimes all the way through the summer without having to do that,” said Lara Hermanson, co-founder of Farmscape, which helped design, install, and maintain the community’s farm.\n\nA rainwater-capture system, though, comes with an upfront cost that a community garden in a lower-income neighborhood might not be able to afford. If one year the rains stop and drought takes hold, it will have to pay for more water. “Perhaps people with the biggest need for food or nutrition security are also sort of disproportionately facing greater water expenses,” said Lucy Diekmann, an urban agriculture and food systems advisor at University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nEven so, one of the many charms of any urban farm or garden is that greenery, and even bare dirt, breaks up the concrete landscape. Historically, cities have been designed to whisk water through gutters and sewers as quickly as possible before it can pool and cause flooding. This strategy struggles to keep up as climate change supercharges rainstorms, making them dump more water. Green spaces let all that liquid soak into the ground, mitigating flooding even without deliberate catchment systems.\n\nStill, an agrihood’s farm isn’t going to run itself. From the very beginning of planning, Hermanson said, a community must decide what it’s going to grow. The general idea is to get as much yield as possible because space is constrained compared to an industrial farm. So pumpkins probably aren’t a great idea, because those plants take up so much room. Instead, in Santa Clara, Hermanson grows Persian cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and hot peppers because they’re small.\n\nWhile an agrihood can’t feasibly provide all the calories residents need, it’s an especially powerful system because the produce that it does produce is highly nutritious. Scale that food production up across a city, and the impact could be huge: One study found that Los Angeles could meet a third of its need for vegetables by converting vacant lots into gardens. “It’s incredible what we could do with what we have, and what we could do even more with intentional planning,” said Catherine Brinkley, a social scientist who studies urban agriculture at the University of California, Davis.\n\nIn Encinitas, Greg Reese, the farm manager at Fox Point Farms, is sending food to the agrihood’s grocery store, so in addition to size he also considers the value of his crops. A lot of that comes down to speed: Arugula grows faster than cantaloupe, meaning Reese can harvest it, send it to market, and grow some more in quick succession. (Given the pleasant climate of Southern California, the farm can grow food for 11, maybe even 12 months of the year.) It can also produce foods that the chefs at the on-site restaurant want. “What is in high demand, and then what grows really fast as well?” Reese said. “I can plant a seed and they can harvest it in a month, or transplant it within two months, so it’s a higher turnover.”\n\nThese crops can even benefit from a quirk of city life: the urban heat island effect. As the sun beats down on all that concrete, asphalt, and brick, the landscape absorbs its thermal energy — raising the mercury well above surrounding rural areas — and slowly releases it at night. This is a growing problem for urbanites struggling with ever-higher temperatures. On the flip side, these green spaces help cool the neighborhood because their plants release water vapor, making summer more comfortable for the surrounding community.\n\nAn agrihood can also support local biodiversity. Planting native flowering species, for instance, simultaneously beautifies the landscape and attracts pollinating insects, hummingbirds, and bats (which eat mosquitoes, an added bonus). Even the flowers the crops produce provide food for these pollinators, which return the favor by helping the plants reproduce.\n\nWith the crop varieties decided, an agrihood can figure out how much refrigeration and storage capacity to build out. Those who live there will also have to decide whether to sell produce from a stand or use it in an on-site restaurant. And they’ll need to project the costs of hiring outside help to keep the farm going.\n\nIt’s not so simple, then, as just erecting a few buildings around a green space and calling it a day. “All those things need to be figured out before you start putting things on paper and making commitments,” Hermanson said. “Successful farms are well-funded, well-staffed. Everyone does better with clear expectations, clear budgets, and then also the community knows what it is they’re getting.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In the past, towns often had farms surrounding their centers to provide food. Today, a new idea called \"agrihoods\" brings that old idea into modern cities by building neighborhoods around working farms.\n\n**What happened** – Two new agrihoods were recently built in California, one in Santa Clara and another called Fox Point Farms in Encinitas. These neighborhoods include homes, shops, and farms that grow fresh fruits and vegetables. The farms use smart systems like rainwater capture to help take care of crops even during dry seasons.\n\n**Impact** – Agrihoods help cities by providing fresh, healthy food close to where people live. They cool neighborhoods by adding green spaces, reduce flooding by soaking up rainwater, and attract helpful insects and birds. These farms also support jobs and local businesses, while offering homes for people with different incomes.\n\n**What's next step** – Communities thinking about building agrihoods will need to plan carefully what to grow, how to manage water, and how to run the farm. They will also decide how to sell or share the food, and make sure the farm has enough money and workers to succeed.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Agrihoods combine homes and farms to create healthier, greener, and more connected neighborhoods in cities.\n",
