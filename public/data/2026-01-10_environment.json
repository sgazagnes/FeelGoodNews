      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn a long-anticipated move, Canada has introduced tougher methane regulations for its oil and gas sector, an industry that accounts for about half of the country’s methane pollution. The goal is to cut methane emissions by 75 percent below 2014 levels by 2035, a move the government says will dramatically reduce the climate impact of one of its biggest industries.\n\nThe new rules, revealed this week, are part of Canada’s broader strategy to rein in its climate footprint without derailing energy production. While oil and gas remain major economic drivers, the government is betting that smarter, cleaner practices can bring emissions down without cutting output in a significant way.\n\nAccording to the Canadian government, these rules are expected to eliminate the equivalent of 304 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions between 2025 and 2035, while reducing production by a mere 0.2 percent.\n\nWhy methane matters (a lot)\n\nMethane may not stick around in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide, but it packs a far more dangerous punch in the short term. Over a 20-year period, methane is up to 80 times more potent than CO₂ when it comes to trapping heat.\n\nA significant portion of methane released in Canada comes from oil and gas production. During drilling, processing, and transport, methane escapes into the atmosphere through leaks, flaring, and direct venting. While previous regulations targeted some of these emissions, experts argued that much stronger action was needed.\n\nWhat the new rules will change\n\nSlated to take effect in 2028, the new regulations prohibit most methane venting, with some exceptions, and lay out a rigorous schedule for leak detection and repair. Companies will be required to inspect their equipment more frequently and either follow standard methods or propose custom approaches, as long as they meet strict methane intensity thresholds.\n\nUnlike earlier proposals that faced pushback for being too rigid, the new rules offer flexibility in how companies meet their targets, encouraging innovation while keeping pressure on performance.\n\nThis regulatory shift fulfills a promise made by Prime Minister Mark Carney, and replaces a 2030 target proposed during Justin Trudeau’s tenure that was never implemented.\n\nA course correction or a climate compromise?\n\nWhile some environmental groups have accused Carney of prioritizing economic growth over environmental urgency, especially after recent rollbacks on other emissions policies, the new methane rules represent a bright spot in Canada’s climate progress.\n\nThanks to previous efforts that required oil and gas operators to conduct regular inspections and repairs, Canada is likely to have met its 2025 target of a 40 to 45 percent methane reduction from 2012 levels. These new rules build on that progress while setting a longer timeline for deeper cuts.\n\nStill, there’s work to do. Despite these methane wins, Canada remains off track to meet its overall greenhouse gas reduction goal of 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, mainly due to continued growth in fossil fuel production.\n\nCan climate and energy coexist?\n\nThis latest policy suggests that Canada is still walking a tightrope between climate ambition and energy investment. The oil and gas sector is unlikely to disappear overnight, but its emissions footprint can shrink, and that’s exactly what the new methane plan aims to prove.\n\nBy targeting one of the most powerful greenhouse gases with stricter monitoring, reduced venting, and tighter thresholds, Canada is betting that climate-smart fossil fuel production isn’t an oxymoron. Whether that gamble pays off in time for 2035 remains to be seen.\n\nDid this story stand out to you?

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Canada’s oil and gas industry produces about half of the country’s methane pollution. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that traps heat much more effectively than carbon dioxide in the short term. Reducing methane emissions is important to slow down climate change.\n\n**What happened** – This week, Canada announced new rules to cut methane emissions from oil and gas by 75 percent below 2014 levels by 2035. The rules will start in 2028 and require companies to find and fix leaks more often, limit methane venting, and meet strict pollution limits. The government expects these rules to prevent 304 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions without much impact on energy production.\n\n**Impact** – These new regulations are one of Canada’s strongest climate actions so far. They target a major source of pollution with flexible but tough standards, encouraging companies to innovate while reducing harmful emissions. This could help Canada meet some of its climate goals and show that energy production and cleaner air can happen together.\n\n**What’s next step** – The rules will take effect in 2028, and companies will need to adjust their operations to meet the new limits. The government will monitor progress and may update policies to keep reducing methane and other greenhouse gases in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Canada’s new methane rules aim to cut a major source of pollution by 75% by 2035, balancing climate goals with ongoing energy production.\n",

      "content": "Cutting down boreal forest and sinking the felled trees in the depths of the Arctic Ocean could remove up to 1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year – but it could come at a cost to the Arctic ecosystem\n\nTrees floating towards the Arctic Ocean Carl Christoph Stadie/The Alfred Wegener Institute\n\nCutting down swathes of boreal forest and sinking the trees into the depths of the Arctic Ocean could remove up to 1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.\n\nConiferous trees prone to wildfires could be felled and carried to the ocean by six major Arctic rivers including the Yukon and Mackenzie, where they would sink in about a year, according to a team of researchers.\n\n“There is now a forest that is sequestering lots of carbon, but now the next thing is how to store it in a way that won’t get burned,” says Ulf Büntgen at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHumanity will need to find ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to compensate for industries that are hard to electrify – or even to begin reducing atmospheric CO2 levels. Direct air capture machines are expensive, however, and planting trees can backfire if they die or burn.\n\nSeveral companies are burying wood, and US firm Running Tide sank 25,000 tonnes of wood chips off Iceland, although it was accused of endangering the environment and later shut down.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nUp to 1 trillion tonnes of carbon are stored in wood, soils and peat in the boreal forest that stretches across northern Eurasia and North America, a number likely to rise as global warming accelerates plant growth. But more frequent and intense wildfires are increasingly releasing that carbon.\n\nBüntgen and his colleagues previously found that wood had survived without rotting and releasing CO2 for 8000 years in cold, low-oxygen Alpine lakes. And the six Arctic rivers export huge amounts of logs, with beached driftwood in their deltas holding 20 million tonnes of carbon or more, estimates Carl Stadie at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, who wasn’t involved in the new research.\n\nIf 30,000 square kilometres could be logged along each river each year – probably in winter when timber could be piled on the river ice – and then replanted, that growth could absorb 1 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, the researchers say.\n\nBut some US rivers still suffer reduced biodiversity a century after timber floating, warns Ellen Wohl at Colorado State University.\n\n“You run a giant mass of logs through, and it’s like you’re ramming a scouring brush down” the river, she says.\n\nMoreover, if timber gets trapped on shore or in tributaries and causes flooding, that could thaw permafrost and stimulate methane emissions by microbes.\n\n“We could see a situation in which the wood itself promotes marine sequestration, but flooding or thaw on land promotes upland carbon release,” says Merritt Turetsky at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nSome wood could also sink where conditions are not cold or anoxic enough to prevent decomposition. Driftwood frozen in sea ice is often carried as far as the Faroe Islands.\n\n“In the worst case, you have just deforested tremendous areas of forest… that stores carbon on its own,” says Stadie.\n\nRoman Dial at Alaska Pacific University, is concerned the proposal would be ripe for abuse by commercial logging and might face attack from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\n“And how long is the list of possible, unavoidable and potentially nasty unintended consequences in the Arctic, a place we hardly understand even now?” he says.\n\nSome areas of the Arctic seafloor probably aren’t good for preservation, says Morgan Raven at the University of California, Santa Barbara. But others are, and they are worth investigating, she says, as massive volumes of wood washing into the Arctic and other oceans may have cooled Earth after a period of hothouse climate 56 million years ago.\n\n“We can go and look in the sediments and in the rocks and in Earth’s history for examples of how this experiment has run in the past,” says Raven.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Boreal forests across northern parts of the world store huge amounts of carbon in their trees and soil. However, these forests face threats from wildfires, which release carbon dioxide (CO2) back into the atmosphere. Scientists are looking for ways to keep this carbon stored safely to help fight climate change.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers suggest cutting down some boreal trees that are at high risk of burning and then sinking them into the deep Arctic Ocean. Six big rivers like the Yukon and Mackenzie could carry these logs to the ocean, where they would sink and stay preserved for a long time. This method could remove up to 1 billion tonnes of CO2 from the air every year. The idea comes from studies showing wood can stay underwater without rotting for thousands of years in cold, low-oxygen places.\n\n**Impact** – This approach could trap a large amount of carbon that would otherwise return to the air through fires or decay. It offers a new way to reduce CO2 that is cheaper than some other technologies. However, it might harm river and ocean ecosystems, cause flooding, or thaw frozen ground, which could release other greenhouse gases. Scientists warn that this method needs careful study to avoid damaging nature while helping the climate.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers want to study which parts of the Arctic Ocean floor are best for storing wood safely. They also want to learn from Earth’s history, where natural wood sinking helped cool the planet millions of years ago.
