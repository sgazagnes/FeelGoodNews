      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 01 September 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-02752-yA July ruling from the International Court of Justice is clear: nations can face consequences if they don’t act on the climate crisis.",
      "content": "The salt spray of the Pacific Ocean is in my blood; I grew up watching the tides shape the shores of the islands of Tuvalu. But now, those tides are rising relentlessly, eroding lands, swallowing homes, decimating livelihoods and washing away the futures of communities. Entire islands are sinking. One-third of Tuvalu’s citizens are seeking ‘climate refuge’ in Australia.\n\nClimate change is not a distant threat; it is our daily reality.\n\nBut there is hope. At the end of July, in The Hague, the Netherlands, I bore witness to a historic moment. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivered the advisory opinion that states have a legal duty to prevent climate harm and, importantly, that they can be held accountable for the consequences of their actions, through financial compensation or other forms of restitution.\n\nA message from island leaders: protect the Pacific Ocean from deep-sea mining\n\nThe ruling means that climate justice is no longer simply a moral obligation, but a matter of international law. This feels like a seismic shift. The relentless cries from front-line communities across the Pacific, who have long borne the brunt of a crisis we did not create, have been heard.\n\nThe ICJ offered clarity on fossil fuels in particular: producing, licensing and subsidizing them could constitute an “internationally wrongful act” for which states can be held liable under international law. Nations have a duty to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions — and the court highlighted the legal liability that could arise from expanding fossil-fuel infrastructure in the face of clear scientific warnings.\n\nIt is especially powerful that this legal breakthrough stems from the efforts of small island nations, launched by courageous Pacific youth in 2019, initially in Vanuatu then through cross-border collaborations. It is a reminder that those most affected by the climate crisis are also among the most determined in addressing it. Through efforts ranging from grassroots movements to international diplomacy, Pacific island nations have charted a path that places justice at the centre of climate governance. This is a powerful example of vulnerable voices driving transformative change at the highest levels of international law.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nThe ICJ also emphasized that cooperation between states is central to meaningful climate action, and identified treaties as a crucial tool for coordinated implementation. This gives wind to the sails of emerging legal instruments. A fossil-fuel non-proliferation treaty has been proposed, for example, that would provide legal grounding for states to pursue coordinated, binding action on a fossil-fuel phase-out and a just transition to renewable energy. It is currently supported by 17 nations, including Tuvalu, that are shaping the treaty proposal and discussing how to involve others and initiate a formal negotiation process. A high-level ministerial meeting in Belém, Brazil, in November, has been planned alongside the COP30 climate talks to move the process forward.",

      "summary": "Marie Tidball MP was born with a congenital disability and wants Parliament to be more accessible.",
      "content": "'Parliament building inaccessible to me,' MP says\n\n5 hours ago Share Save James Vincent Political editor, BBC Yorkshire Share Save\n\nMP Marie Tidball shares campaign for better accessibility in House of Parliament\n\nMarie Tidball MP says she is joking when she threatens to chain herself to a Parliament door handle. But I am not entirely sure I believe her. Tidball was born with a congenital disability, which affects all four limbs. She has foreshortened arms and legs, with one digit on each hand. When she was a child she missed three years of school because of the critical surgeries she needed. The disability campaigner was elected as Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire last July, and says that while getting into politics is difficult, getting around the Houses of Parliament is hard when you have a disability. As MPs return to Parliament following the summer recess, I took a tour around the building with her. It is not long before we reach a heavy wooden door with one of the round, smooth door handles. \"Within about five months of being here, I had about six conversations with senior people about door handles,\" she tells me. \"And I said if I have to have another conversation about why we need to make the door handles more accessible I will chain myself to them - rather irreverently I might say.\"\n\nBBC/James Vincent Many of the historic doorknobs in the Houses of Parliament are hard to use\n\nA Parliament spokesperson says work is taking place to upgrade access for disabled people and the House of Commons Modernisation Committee is currently looking at how to improve things. But Tidball says there is a long way to go. \"Twenty-two per cent of the voting age population are disabled,\" she says. \"We absolutely need to make sure that the composition of Parliament reflects those numbers. It makes our politics much more rich.\" As we go up and down sets of stairs and in and out of doors, we talk about how far away the accessible toilets are from some of the committee rooms. And when you get there, you have to push open a heavy door to get into them. I ask Tidball if any of this makes her angry. \"It does make me angry but you know what they say - don't get angry, get organised,\" she says, smiling. \"Ultimately I want to make this place more inclusive for other disabled people who might come through the doors.\"\n\nBBC/James Vincent Westminster Hall, the oldest building in Parliament, was built more than 900 years ago\n\nAs our footsteps echo across the stone floor tiles and the courtyards of Parliament, I notice we have already done a fair chunk of our recommended 10,000 daily steps. Walking through the buildings is a good way to bump into fellow MPs but you can cover a fair distance. Tidball wants to show me a change that has already been made in the newer Portcullis House - an accessible door. I joke that perhaps it should have a plaque with her name on outside and Tidball laughs as she says it might be a part of her legacy. She is among several disabled MPs who have given evidence to the Modernisation Committee about accessibility. A number reported challenges including concerns about dark spaces in the historic Palace of Westminster, a lack of accessible toilet facilities and unclear signage.\n\nBBC/James Vincent Parliament, including the Central Lobby, can be an intimidating place to navigate\n\nWe have been given special permission to walk around certain areas of the Houses of Parliament with Tidball. The scale of the buildings is not often seen by the public. As a political editor, I am supposed to be used to all the statues, vaulted ceilings, and, to be frank, posh surroundings. But I'm not. It instantly strikes me as an amazing slice of history but a very difficult place to navigate if you do not necessarily feel welcome. When we get to Central Lobby we are being looked down upon by statues of former prime ministers as we chat. This is Parliament's meeting place. Members of the Commons and Lords mingle here and technically you can turn up here as a member of the public and ask to see your MP, although you are encouraged to make an appointment. That is of course, if you feel like you can. Fifteen years ago, the government passed the Equalities Act in these buildings. The duty to make it easier for disabled people to access public spaces was made law in the room right next to where we are stood. The irony is that room, the Commons Chamber, is still inaccessible to many.\n\nThe House of Commons Modernisation Committee is looking to improve accessibility\n\nThese buildings are not easy to modernise. But it is not just the fixtures and fittings that need to be looked at. The archaic ways of Parliament, that some people love, can create barriers for disabled MPs. To get the Speaker's attention during a debate, MPs stand up and sit down, pretty much constantly, to grab his eye. \"Sitting on those green benches is really special, but they were designed for tall men so for me it is a bit of struggle,\" Tidball says. She adds that although she feels \"incredibly lucky\" to be in Parliament, there are other physical challenges to the job. When MPs vote they walk through voting lobbies - either the Aye or the No lobby. \"Its a long old walk, it takes about 15 minutes per vote,\" Tidball says. \"We've done 10 votes in a day before. \"\n\n'Changes are needed'\n\nTidball wants everyone to feel like they could become an MP and hopes that Parliament can reflect society In terms of it being welcoming for everyone, however, I ask her if it is good enough. \"It's not good enough. That is why we'll continue to work hard to make it better,\" she says. \"I think we've got the will there to make those changes.\" \"That culture has already changed and the staff have been incredible. \"While I have the privilege of being here, I've got to do what I can to make it easier for the next generation of disabled young people - to make them feel that this space is for them. \"I also want to make sure that constituents, regardless of whether they've got disabilities or not, feel that this is their house too.\"\n\nThe House of Commons Modernisation Committee is currently looking at how to improve things. An accessible toilet has been installed near the Commons Chamber, as well as improved signage and lighting. A report is due to be published later in the year with plans for bigger changes. Lucy Powell, Leader of the House of Commons and Chair of the Modernisation Committee, said: \"The House of Commons must set an example on accessibility, yet we're repeatedly falling short of what we expect from every other employer in the country. \"No-one can have listened to the evidence we've heard over the past months and not feel compelled to act.\" She said it is \"unacceptable\" that the role of an MP is made harder by the structure of the building and by inaccessible procedures and processes. \"Our inquiry is ongoing, and we'll be setting out a whole host of ambitious recommendations in the autumn, but with these quick and important actions we make this a more workable and welcoming place to all those who use it,\" she said.\n\nA Parliament spokesperson said: \"It is vital that Parliament is accessible to all. \"We understand that there is more to be done to ensure that disabled people do not face unnecessary difficulties when working in or visiting Parliament.\" They said Parliament is \"committed to making further essential adjustments\". \"In the meantime, we are getting on with work across the estate to ensure the safety of our colleagues and visitors, as well as supporting the continued business of Parliament,\" they said.\n\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North",

On July 31, 2024, state agents had pulled the three off a plane before takeoff at Harare’s international airport and held them incommunicado for nearly eight hours. The arrests appeared to be part of an intensified crackdown on opposition and civil society groups ahead of the Southern African Development Community Summit of Heads of State and Government in Harare in August 2024.“The baseless prosecution of the three human rights activists shed a spotlight on unjust arrests, mistreatment, and politically motivated trials in Zimbabwe,” said Idriss Ali Nassah, senior Africa Researcher at Human Rights Watch. “It shouldn’t have taken a year for the defendants to be acquitted, such cases need to end.”The police had charged them with participating in an illegal protest outside the Harare Magistrates Court in June 2024. United Nations special rapporteurs described the charges against the three activists as “baseless” and of “being used as a fig-leaf to target human rights defenders and opposition voices for calling for greater democracy, human rights and accountability in Zimbabwe.”Initially, a Harare magistrate denied the three bail, ruling that they were likely to abscond or commit other offenses, and that their release might undermine delivery of justice. In September 2024, the High Court granted them bail after they had spent 35 days in detention.The trial began on September 5. The prosecution continued with the proceedings for nearly a year, even after Kwekweza demonstrated that her passport showed that she was not even in the country when the alleged offense occurred.At the trial, the activists’ lawyers documented evidence of torture and other ill-treatment. Chere, who leads a teachers’ union, had bloodstained clothes and limped in pain during his first court appearance after the arrest. Doctors determined that Chere had suffered extensive soft tissue injuries and was in urgent need of treatment to prevent permanent kidney damage. Gwenzi, a member of a local council and a human rights activist, said his interrogators had assaulted him and threatened to harm his family.The administration of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power in a military coup in 2017, has committed serious human rights violations and has failed to institute promised reforms to improve respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, Human Rights Watch said. The authorities have arbitrarily arrested and prosecuted critics of the government on baseless charges.Violence, intimidation, harassment, and repression aimed principally at political opposition members and civil society activists have restricted civic and political space. Many of those arrested have been denied basic due process, including the presumption of innocence and the right to bail.“Even as I celebrate a court victory, it is still only half a victory because the system remains unchanged,” Kwekweza said in a statement after the acquittal. “Without accountability, my acquittal remains only half a victory. There are many others still facing judicial persecution appearing in court for crimes they did not commit…. There are many more who have been convicted in political trials, abducted, tortured, and silenced.”Zimbabwe’s Constitution, as well as the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which Zimbabwe has ratified, protect the rights to freedom of association and expression. The two treaties also provide for the pretrial rights of detainees, as well as freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.“The year-long prosecution of these three activists and other peaceful critics of the government on baseless charges shows the Zimbabwe government’s lack of resolve to institute lasting human rights reforms,” Nassah said. “Zimbabwe authorities should respect the right to fair trial for everyone in line with the government’s domestic and international obligations and stop weaponizing the criminal justice system against human rights defenders, activists, and journalists.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In Zimbabwe, human rights activists often face arrests and trials that critics say are politically motivated. These actions usually target those who speak out against the government, limiting freedom and fairness.\n\n**What happened** – On August 21, 2025, a court in Harare, Zimbabwe, acquitted three human rights activists—Robson Chere, Namatai Kwekweza, and Samuel Gwenzi—after they were charged with disorderly conduct. The activists had been arrested in July 2024 when state agents stopped them from boarding a plane and held them for eight hours without communication. They were accused of taking part in an illegal protest the previous June, but evidence later showed one was out of the country at the time.\n\n**Impact** – This acquittal is important because it highlights how the court system can sometimes be used unfairly against activists in Zimbabwe. The trial lasted nearly a year, during which the activists faced mistreatment and long detention. Their release shows that justice can prevail even in difficult situations. It also brings attention to ongoing problems like unfair arrests and poor treatment of critics in Zimbabwe.\n\n**What's next step** – Human Rights Watch and others are urging Zimbabwe’s government to stop using the criminal justice system to punish activists and to respect fair trial rights. The activists themselves say that while this court decision is a victory, much work remains to ensure that others are not unfairly targeted or mistreated.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – After a year-long politically motivated trial, three Zimbabwean activists were acquitted, shining a light on the need for fair justice and respect for human rights in the country.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Au Zimbabwe, les militants des droits humains sont souvent arrêtés et jugés dans des procès considérés comme politiquement motivés. Ces actions visent ceux qui critiquent le gouvernement, limitant la liberté et l’équité.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Le 21 août 2025, un tribunal à Harare a acquitté trois militants des droits humains — Robson Chere, Namatai Kwekweza et Samuel Gwenzi — accusés de trouble à l’ordre public. Ils avaient été arrêtés en juillet 2024, empêchés d’embarquer dans un avion et détenus huit heures sans contact. Ils étaient accusés d’avoir participé à une manifestation illégale en juin, mais l’un d’eux était à l’étranger à ce moment.\n\n**Impact** – Cet acquittement est important car il montre que le système judiciaire peut parfois être utilisé injustement contre les militants au Zimbabwe. Le procès a duré presque un an, pendant lequel ils ont subi des mauvais traitements et une longue détention. Leur libération prouve que la justice peut triompher même dans des situations difficiles. Cela attire aussi l’attention sur les problèmes persistants d’arrestations injustes et de mauvais traitements.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Human Rights Watch et d’autres demandent au gouvernement zimbabwéen de cesser d’utiliser la justice pour punir les militants et de respecter les droits à un procès équitable. Les militants eux-mêmes disent que cette décision est une victoire, mais qu’il reste beaucoup à faire pour protéger les autres.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Après un procès politique d’un an, trois militants zimbabwéens ont été acquittés, soulignant le besoin d’une justice équitable et du respect des droits humains dans le pays.",

Estas acciones buscan silenciar a quienes critican al gobierno, limitando la libertad y la justicia.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El 21 de agosto de 2025, un tribunal en Harare, Zimbabue, absolvió a tres activistas de derechos humanos — Robson Chere, Namatai Kwekweza y Samuel Gwenzi — tras ser acusados de conducta desordenada. Fueron arrestados en julio de 2024 cuando agentes estatales los detuvieron antes de abordar un avión y los mantuvieron incomunicados por ocho horas. Se les acusó de participar en una protesta ilegal en junio, aunque una de ellas estaba fuera del país en esa fecha.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta absolución es importante porque muestra cómo el sistema judicial a veces se usa injustamente contra activistas en Zimbabue. El juicio duró casi un año, durante el cual sufrieron malos tratos y detención prolongada. Su liberación demuestra que la justicia puede prevalecer incluso en situaciones difíciles y llama la atención sobre problemas persistentes como arrestos injustos y maltrato.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Human Rights Watch y otros grupos instan al gobierno de Zimbabue a dejar de usar el sistema judicial para castigar a activistas y a respetar el derecho a un juicio justo. Los activistas dicen que, aunque esta decisión es una victoria, aún queda mucho por hacer para proteger a otros.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Tras un juicio político de un año, tres activistas en Zimbabue fueron absueltos, destacando la necesidad de justicia justa y respeto a los derechos humanos en el país.",
