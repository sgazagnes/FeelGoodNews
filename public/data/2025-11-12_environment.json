      "content": "This week, as world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), once again it seems that there will be more rhetoric than real solutions for the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate.\n\nMy native Belize — with its tropical rainforests, coastal wetlands and coral reefs — is one such country. Warming seas are killing our reefs. Hurricanes and wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity.\n\n‘Almost utopian’: how protecting the environment is boosting the economy in Brazil\n\nAs a biologist with two decades of experience in academia and conservation, I have learnt that, to protect natural resources, local communities must bey empowered to steward these efforts — and that women are often best placed to drive them, at least in Latin America and the Caribbean, but probably everywhere.\n\nIn many cultures, women are the de facto main carers and custodians of community knowledge. They are often in positions, paid or otherwise, to make their communities healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful — making them well-suited to lead climate action and conservation work.\n\nI am the managing director of the Belize Maya Forest Trust, a non-profit organization dedicated to conserving nearly 1,000 square kilometres of the country’s tropical forest. I also chair the board of directors of the Belize Network of NGOs, an umbrella organization for many of the more than 100 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the country. In Belize, many prominent conservation organizations are led by women. Take the Community Baboon Sanctuary, a globally recognized conservation effort that protects the habitat of the Yucatán black-howler monkey (Alouatta pigra). Today, the sanctuary is managed by the Community Baboon Sanctuary Women’s Conservation Group, which is directed by women from seven Belizean villages.\n\nAnd over the past five years, working with the government of Belize and The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, women in Belize have had key roles in the execution of game-changing sustainable-financing initiatives. One is Belize’s first large-scale project to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation, which is helping to protect the Belize Maya Forest, an area that includes some of the world’s most biodiversity-rich lands. Another is Belize Blue Bonds — which, when the deal closed in November 2021, was the world’s largest debt-refinancing scheme for ocean conservation.\n\nThe more I participate in advocacy and interact with civil-society organizations — both in Belize and internationally — the more I find myself in rooms full of women striving to protect the environment and defend human rights.\n\nBut I have also noticed that women are not usually negotiating for funds, deciding whether to launch large initiatives or setting national priorities.\n\nIs it time to give up trying to save coral reefs? My research says no\n\nBelize is again a case in point. In any of the ten elections since Belize gained independence in 1981, at most four women have been elected to the 28–31-member House of Representatives, the most powerful arm of the country’s legislature. Other female parliamentarians have been appointed by the prime minister, but these positions tend to have much less authority than do those elected through popular vote. Also, female ministers are usually put in charge of human or rural-development issues, rather than the country’s economy, land, infrastructure or defence.\n\nFor countries to build resilience and protect their biodiversity in the time needed, more women must be made equal partners in decision making.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Belize faces serious environmental challenges like warming seas harming coral reefs, more hurricanes, and wildfires. The country’s rich forests and wildlife are at risk, and climate change is making life harder for local communities.\n\n**What happened** – In Belize, women are playing a key role in protecting nature and fighting climate change. They lead important projects like the Community Baboon Sanctuary, which protects a special type of monkey, and help manage large programs to reduce forest loss and save the ocean. These efforts involve partnerships with the government and global groups like The Nature Conservancy.\n\n**Impact** – Women in Belize bring valuable knowledge and care to their communities, making them strong leaders in conservation. However, they are still underrepresented in government where big decisions about money and policies are made. This gap means that even though women do much of the work on the ground, they don’t always get to shape national plans.\n\n**What’s next step** – The upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil is a chance to push for more gender equality in climate leadership. Giving women equal power in government could help Belize and other countries make better decisions to protect nature and handle climate risks.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Women in Belize lead important climate and conservation projects but need more influence in government to strengthen the country’s environmental future.",

Ces actions sont menées en partenariat avec le gouvernement et des organisations mondiales comme The Nature Conservancy.\n\n**Impact** – Les femmes au Belize apportent leurs connaissances et leur attention aux communautés, ce qui fait d’elles des leaders efficaces en conservation. Pourtant, elles sont encore peu présentes au gouvernement où se prennent les décisions majeures sur les budgets et les politiques. Ce manque signifie que, même si les femmes font beaucoup sur le terrain, elles n’influencent pas toujours les plans nationaux.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – La prochaine Conférence des Nations Unies sur le changement climatique (COP30) au Brésil est une occasion de défendre plus d’égalité entre les sexes dans le leadership climatique.

      "summary": "Every fall, we here at Earth911 anxiously await our favorite holiday. No, it’s not Halloween...\nThe post How To Get Involved in America Recycles Day in 2025 appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "Every fall, we here at Earth911 anxiously await our favorite holiday. No, it’s not Halloween or Thanksgiving (although those are pretty great, too) — it’s America Recycles Day, coming up on November 15.\n\nAmerica Recycles Day (ARD) is the only nationally recognized day dedicated to promoting and celebrating recycling in the United States. A Keep America Beautiful (KAB) initiative, this annual event began in 1997 to spread the word about the importance of recycling and educate others on how to recycle correctly. Every year, on and around November 15, thousands of local event organizers plan activities to encourage people in their communities to recycle.\n\nNot everyone knows that there is a right and wrong way to recycle, but there is! In fact, one of the biggest barriers to recycling is knowing what items can (and cannot) be recycled. ARD events help individuals understand the value of recycling correctly — and why it’s so important that we all participate.\n\nA 2025 survey by The Harris Poll conducted for Keep America Beautiful shows that 87% of Americans believe recycling is essential and that support for recycling cuts across age groups, geographic regions, and political affiliations. However, the national recycling rate remains stuck at 32%. The gap between belief and action is our opportunity to make a difference by acting and applying proper recycling practices.\n\nIn 2025, Keep America Beautiful (KAB) has expanded the celebration beyond a single day. This November, America Recycles Day becomes America Recycles Month, and KAB offers daily challenges throughout the month. Participants can complete a daily challenge, share their progress using #AmericaRecycles, and tag @KeepAmericaBeautiful on social media. It’s a fun way to see how many days in a row you can reduce, reuse, and recycle while building lasting sustainable habits.\n\nWays to Get Involved in 2025\n\nTake the Recycling Reality Check Quiz\n\nThink you know what’s recyclable and what’s not? Test your knowledge with Keep America Beautiful’s Recycling Reality Check Quiz. You might be surprised by what you discover! This interactive quiz helps identify common recycling mistakes and teaches you how to recycle right.\n\nTake the #BeRecycled Pledge\n\nKAB continues its popular #BeRecycled Pledge, inviting Americans to commit to reducing, reusing, and recycling in all aspects of daily life. By taking the pledge, you join thousands of others in a collective national effort to improve recycling. The pledge includes three simple commitments:\n\nLearn. Find out what materials are collected for recycling in your community.\n\nAct. Within the next month, reduce the amount of waste you produce, recycle more, and buy products made with recycled content.\n\nShare. In the next month, encourage one family member or one friend to take the #BeRecycled pledge.\n\nJoin the Greatest American Cleanup\n\nRecycling isn’t just about sorting bins at home. The Greatest American Cleanup provides opportunities to jump into action and make recycling part of your community beautification mission. It’s not just about cleaning up litter. Giving those materials a second life prevents them from ending up in a landfill.\n\nSupport the National Recycling Goal\n\nThe EPA recognizes America Recycles Day as an important milestone in working toward the National Recycling Goal: increasing the U.S. recycling rate to 50 percent by 2030. Today, America’s recycling rate stands at 32 percent, up from less than seven percent in 1960. By recycling right, you’re contributing to this ambitious national goal.\n\nLearn What Can (and Cannot) Be Recycled\n\nOne of the most important actions you can take is understanding your local recycling guidelines. Curbside programs commonly accept items like cardboard, metal cans, and paper, but items like plastic bags, electronics, and batteries typically should not be placed in the curbside recycling bin. Visit the EPA’s Common Recyclables guide to learn how to recycle specific items. Search Earth911’s Recycling Locator to discover what’s accepted in your community.\n\nOrganize Your Own Event\n\nIf you’d like to organize your own America Recycles Day event, KAB has resources to help you get started. Past events have included:\n\n“Fall into recycling” events to swap Halloween costumes and compost leftover pumpkins\n\nFree electronics recycling drives to reduce e-waste\n\nWaste-free lunch initiatives at schools\n\nPledge drives at neighborhood meetings\n\nLitter cleanup events along waterways and in parks\n\nRecycling education workshops at libraries and community centers\n\nKAB welcomes unique recycling-related ideas and provides support to help make your event successful. By registering your event, you join a strong network of individuals and organizations across the nation committed to improving curbside recycling and building a comprehensive recycling platform for America.\n\nFinding Local Events\n\nMany local nonprofits, government entities, corporations, and private and public organizations host events during the week of November 15. To find events in your area:\n\nCheck your local government’s website for recycling and environmental programs\n\nSearch for Keep America Beautiful affiliate chapters in your region\n\nFollow local waste management companies on social media\n\nSearch social media using #AmericaRecycles and #AmericaRecyclesDay\n\nContact your municipal recycling coordinator\n\nLocal events include facility tours, educational workshops, recycling collection drives for hard-to-recycle items, and community cleanup activities.\n\n2025 Local America Recycles Day Events\n\nHere are six community events taking place on November 15, 2025. There are many other recycling events scheduled, showing that Americans are celebrating recycling:\n\nNorfolk, Virginia – UpCycle Festival\n\nKeep Norfolk Beautiful and Norfolk Public Library host this sustainability festival from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Mary D. Pretlow Anchor Branch Library. The festival features hands-on workshops including composting, jewelry-making and repair, basic hand-sewing, plastic-bag basket weaving, and metal flower-making. The Norfolk Environmental Commission will host a panel discussion on actionable solutions to combat plastic pollution.\n\nTuolumne County, California – Free Drive-Thru Recycling\n\nTuolumne County Public Works holds a free drive-thru recycling event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Mother Lode Fairgrounds in Sonora. The Salvation Army will be on-site to accept gently used clothing and household goods. Visit the county website for a list of acceptable recyclable materials.\n\nMonroe, Louisiana – Ouachita Green Annual Event\n\nOuachita Green’s annual drive-through recycling event runs from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Monroe Civic Center. Residents can drop off electronics, cardboard, paper, plastic, glass, and metal without leaving their vehicles. The event is free to attend, and volunteers help with unloading. Open to all Ouachita Parish households.\n\nApache Junction, Arizona – Electronics Recycling\n\nThe City of Apache Junction hosts an electronics recycling event from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. Apache Junction and Gold Canyon residents can properly dispose of electronic waste, including computers, monitors, TVs, and other electronics.\n\nFort Washington, Pennsylvania – E-Waste Collection\n\nPAR-Recycle Works holds a community electronics recycling event from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Lifetime Fitness. Residents can drop off e-waste for proper recycling and disposal.\n\nFort Worth, Texas – Library Education Series\n\nThe Fort Worth Public Library offers 50 activities across multiple library locations throughout the day. Events include educational workshops and interactive programs designed to educate residents on the importance of recycling and sustainable practices.\n\nThe Impact of Your Actions\n\nRecycling well is more than simply placing items in a curbside bin. When done correctly, recycling:\n\nReduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators\n\nConserves natural resources such as timber, water, and minerals\n\nIncreases economic security by tapping domestic sources of materials\n\nPrevents pollution by reducing the need to mine raw materials\n\nSaves energy\n\nSupports American manufacturing\n\nCreates jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries\n\nAccording to the EPA’s 2020 Recycling Economic Information study, which analyzed 2012 data, recycling and reuse activities accounted for 681,000 jobs, $37.8 billion in wages, and $5.5 billion in tax revenues. Your recycling creates 1.17 jobs for every 1,000 tons of materials.\n\nMake It a Year-Round Commitment\n\nIf America Recycles Day provides an opportunity to learn and take action, your real impact comes from making recycling a daily habit. Use November 15 as a starting point to evaluate your recycling practices, learn what can be recycled in your community, and commit to recycling correctly all year long. However, confusion, inconsistent rules, and lack of access are keeping recycling rates stubbornly low—a figure that has remained steady for nearly a decade.\n\nLearn more about America Recycles Day and access additional resources at AmericaRecyclesDay.org and the EPA’s America Recycles Day page.\n\nEditor’s Note: Originally published on November 2, 2025, this article was most recently updated in November 2025.",

      "summary": "",
      "content": "In January 2004, Cyclone Heta pummeled the shores of the island nation of Niue, uprooting trees and flooding homes with 184 mile-per-hour winds and 164-foot waves. As dawn approached, after an intense night, the winds died down, and Coral Pasisi began to worry about her neighbors. The storm had been more violent than she’d expected — a tree had fallen on her roof, and the water was up to her ankles. It was 4 in the morning when she began her drive to check on her community.\n\nNormally, when Pasisi drove down the hill of the western shore of the island, she saw the national museum with its familiar outdoor amphitheater where she’d watched so many traditional dance performances. But instead, there was a clear view of the ocean. The museum was gone.\n\nYour support powers solutions-focused climate reporting — keeping it free for everyone.

Two people on the island died during the storm, then home to just over 1,700 residents, and damage was estimated to be nearly 48 million U.S. dollars — five times the nation’s annual gross domestic product. Two decades after the storm, the memory of the missing museum still brings her to tears.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\n“This is an unimaginable and irreparable and irreplaceable non-economic loss. One that cannot be remedied or restored,” Pasisi told the International Court of Justice, or ICJ, at The Hague in December 2024. “One that has robbed our children of their future inherent rights of traditional knowledge and cultural identity.”\n\nPasisi’s testimony was among more than 100 that would help propel the ICJ to issue a landmark advisory opinion that every nation on earth has a legal obligation to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Now, Pasisi is among many Indigenous Pacific advocates who are traveling to Brazil to attend COP30 — the annual intergovernmental gathering of U.N. member states — to try to ensure that world leaders adhere to that ruling.\n\n“This is a different lens of clarity that we all have now going into COP30,” said Pasisi, who is now a director of climate change and sustainability at The Pacific Community (SPC), a New Caledonia-based international development organization made up of Pacific nations and territories as well as global partners like the U.S. No longer are she and her fellow Pasifika advocates simply arguing that leaders have an ethical responsibility to save the planet, she said. “There’s nothing like a legal opinion to show what side of the law you need to be on.”\n\nPacific advocates at COP30 are demanding global leaders follow the ICJ’s ruling by phasing out fossil fuels and funding climate disaster recovery projects. Many are also calling for Indigenous peoples and traditional ecological knowledge to be included in climate decision-making and are pushing back on efforts to sacrifice Pacific seabeds for lucrative transition mineral mining operations. They argue the next COP should be held in Australia, where they hope to better convey how climate change is impacting their lands and waters.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nBut while the ICJ ruling clarifies international law, it is a non-binding advisory opinion and nations can flout its directives. A failure to adhere to that ruling, however, would undermine the court and the global system of international law while further exacerbating the climate crisis. Considering that the ICJ case was originally brought by law students at the University of the South Pacific in Vanuatu, that makes this COP one of the most important in the event’s last 30 years for advocates from the Pacific.\n\n“Our homes, cultures, and ways of life are at the front lines of a crisis we did not cause,” said Belyndar Rikimani, of the Solomon Islands and one of the founders of the Vanuatu student group that pushed for the successful ICJ climate ruling. “Our goal is to remind negotiators that behind every policy decision are real people and real lives at risk.”\n\nSindra Sharma, international policy lead at the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network, wants COP30 negotiations to result in country participants being required to revise their national emissions targets to ensure that the world won’t exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. “We’re going into this COP now for the first time ever in the history of COPs armed with what (the ICJ) gave us, which is a tool of hope and ambition,” she said. “We’re going to really use that tool to make sure that we can come out of this with the justice that is necessary for people and the rest of the ecosystems.”\n\nBetter accountability is essential, agreed Pasisi, as well as more money to both prepare for climate impacts and recover from the aftermath. When Niue sought help from global climate finance organizations to help rebuild in the aftermath of the 2004 cyclone, its leaders were told that rebuilding their infrastructure did not meet the grant criteria. The community would’ve qualified if it was relocating before the storm hit. Disaster response, they learned, did not qualify as climate adaptation.\n\nThrough her current job, Pasisi now provides technical assistance to Pacific communities who are trying to get grants from global funders like the Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund. But she said it frequently takes eight years for the money to arrive, and local programs need faster funding.\n\nMoney and ambitious climate goals are important, but a delegation of Māori youth from New Zealand Aotearoa are also calling for Indigenous decision-making power in climate governance. Unlike many other Pacific island nations, like Niue, the Māori of Aotearoa did not achieve self-determination through the U.N. process and don’t have a seat at the table at the U.N.\n\n“We will not accept climate ‘solutions’ that repeat systems of extraction and inequity. Climate action must center Indigenous rights, honor Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and recognize the personhood of te taiao,” they said in a statement referring to a treaty between Māori chiefs and New Zealand’s first settlers, and using Māori term for the natural world.\n\nEarlier this year, a mountain known as Taranaki Maunga was granted legal personhood in Aotearoa, a legal status that is intended to further conservation and traditional uses of the area that’s considered an ancestor to the Māori people. Aotearoa has also granted legal personhood to a forest and a river, part of a growing movement to recognize the rights of nature that’s also rooted in Indigenous values.\n\nBy now, Pasisi has attended more COPs than she can remember, and knows that even when political leaders make big promises, the next administration can easily renege on them. “It definitely is soul-destroying for lots of people who have been in the process for so long,” she said.\n\nBut this year, the biggest aspect that gives her hope is not anything that world leaders have said, nor even the text of the ICJ ruling — it’s the enthusiasm and dedication of Pacific youth like Rikimani. “I think when you see young people step up and say, ʻActually, this is my future, that we’re not going to drown, we’re actually going to survive and thrive. There isn’t an option to fail’ — that kind of commitment from our young people and voices is really powerful and encouraging,” Pasisi said.\n\n“The fact that they led the ICJ call just shows you how powerful young people can be if you give them the space, and you support them in that process.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In 2004, Cyclone Heta caused severe damage to the island nation of Niue, destroying homes, important buildings, and the national museum. The storm showed how vulnerable Pacific islands are to extreme weather caused by climate change.\n\n**What happened** – In December 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) gave a landmark advisory opinion that all countries have a legal duty to limit greenhouse gas emissions to protect the planet. This ruling followed testimonies from people like Coral Pasisi from Niue, who shared the lasting damage and loss her island faced. Pacific island leaders and Indigenous advocates will use this ruling at the COP30 climate talks in Brazil to push for real action.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time the world’s top court has clearly stated a legal obligation for all nations to reduce emissions. For Pacific islanders, who face rising seas and storms, this ruling adds legal weight to their calls for help. It also highlights the need to include Indigenous knowledge and protect their lands from harmful mining. The ruling is advisory, so countries don’t have to follow it, but ignoring it would weaken international law.\n\n**What's next step** – At COP30, Pacific advocates want countries to stop using fossil fuels, fund recovery from climate disasters, and respect Indigenous rights in climate decisions. They also hope the next COP will be held in Australia to better show the climate risks Pacific islands face. Meanwhile, faster and fairer climate funding is needed to help vulnerable communities prepare and rebuild.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A historic legal opinion supports Pacific islanders’ fight against climate change and strengthens calls for urgent global action at COP30.\n",

      "content": "High-voltage copper plates can remove up to three-quarters of frost from a surface, while using much less energy than conventional heating\n\nAeroplanes are usually defrosted by spraying them with antifreeze Jaromir Chalabala / Alamy\n\nStatic electricity can remove up to three-quarters of frost from a surface, which could save vast amounts of energy and millions of tonnes of antifreeze currently used to defrost vehicles.\n\nIn 2021, Jonathan Boreyko at Virginia Tech and his colleagues serendipitously discovered that frost becomes naturally charged as it forms. They used this natural electric field to charge a nearby film of water that could then, in turn, pluck ice crystals from the frost, acting as a natural de-icer. This effect, however, was minuscule and had little effect on the frost overall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Boreyko and his team have developed a more effective defrosting system by using an extremely high-voltage copper electrode suspended above frost-covered glass or copper. This system can remove half the frost from a surface in around 10 to 15 minutes, and 75 per cent of frost if the surface is also highly water-repellent. “Instead of taking advantage of frost’s pre-existing voltage, we’re trying to turbo-boost the whole effect by applying our own voltage,” says Boreyko.\n\nRemoving 50 per cent of frost from a surface using their method required an electrode charged to 550 volts, more than double the voltage supplied by mains electricity in most countries. Unlike electrical sockets, though, the electrode has a vanishingly small current, making it relatively safe. Accidentally touching the electrode would generate an electric shock comparable to an electric fence used on farms, says Boreyko.\n\nThis small current also ensures it requires little energy, less than half the energy it would take to heat the frost directly, according to Boreyko.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Daily The latest on what’s new in science and why it matters each day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nAs well as potentially being used in car windows and on roads, a fast and efficient defrosting method could also be helpful in the aviation industry, which uses vast quantities of antifreeze to ensure aeroplane wings are free of ice that might affect flying performance.\n\n“Instead of dousing hundreds of litres of antifreeze over an airplane wing to de-ice it when it’s taxiing, instead you just have this machine that can drive around airport runways with an electric wand and, as you wave the high-voltage wand over the wing, it just pulls all of that ice and snow right off,” says Boreyko.",
