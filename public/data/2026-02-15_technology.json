      "title": "Brain inspired machines are better at math than expected",
      "summary": "Neuromorphic computers modeled after the human brain can now solve the complex equations behind physics simulations — something once thought possible only with energy-hungry supercomputers. The breakthrough could lead to powerful, low-energy supercomputers while revealing new secrets about how our brains process information.",
      "content": "Computers designed to mimic the structure of the human brain are showing an unexpected strength. They can solve some of the demanding mathematical equations that lie at the heart of major scientific and engineering problems.\n\nIn a study published in Nature Machine Intelligence, Sandia National Laboratories computational neuroscientists Brad Theilman and Brad Aimone introduced a new algorithm that allows neuromorphic hardware to solve partial differential equations, or PDEs -- the mathematical foundation for modeling phenomena such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetic fields and structural mechanics.\n\nThe results demonstrate that neuromorphic systems can handle these equations efficiently. The advance could help open the door to the first neuromorphic supercomputer, offering a new path toward energy efficient computing for national security and other critical applications.\n\nThe research was funded by the Department of Energy's Office of Science through the Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Basic Energy Sciences programs, as well as the National Nuclear Security Administration's Advanced Simulation and Computing program.\n\nSolving Partial Differential Equations With Brain Like Hardware\n\nPartial differential equations are essential for simulating real world systems. They are used to forecast weather, analyze how materials respond to stress, and model complex physical processes. Traditionally, solving PDEs requires enormous computing power. Neuromorphic computers approach the problem differently by processing information in ways that resemble how the brain operates.\n\n\"We're just starting to have computational systems that can exhibit intelligent-like behavior. But they look nothing like the brain, and the amount of resources that they require is ridiculous, frankly,\" Theilman said.\n\nFor years, neuromorphic systems were mainly viewed as tools for pattern recognition or for speeding up artificial neural networks. Few expected them to manage mathematically rigorous problems such as PDEs, which are typically handled by large scale supercomputers.\n\nAimone and Theilman were not surprised by the outcome. They argue that the human brain routinely carries out highly complex calculations, even if people are unaware of it.\n\n\"Pick any sort of motor control task -- like hitting a tennis ball or swinging a bat at a baseball,\" Aimone said. \"These are very sophisticated computations. They are exascale-level problems that our brains are capable of doing very cheaply.\"\n\nEnergy Efficient Computing for National Security\n\nThe findings could have major implications for the National Nuclear Security Administration, which is responsible for maintaining the nation's nuclear deterrent. Supercomputers used across the nuclear weapons complex consume vast amounts of electricity to simulate the physics of nuclear systems and other high stakes scenarios.\n\nNeuromorphic computing may provide a way to significantly cut energy use while still delivering strong computational performance. By solving PDEs in a brain inspired manner, these systems suggest that large simulations could be run using far less power than conventional supercomputers require.\n\n\"You can solve real physics problems with brain-like computation,\" Aimone said. \"That's something you wouldn't expect because people's intuition goes the opposite way. And in fact, that intuition is often wrong.\"\n\nThe team envisions neuromorphic supercomputers eventually becoming central to Sandia's mission of protecting national security.\n\nWhat Neuromorphic Computing Reveals About the Brain\n\nBeyond engineering advances, the research also touches on deeper questions about intelligence and how the brain performs calculations. The algorithm developed by Theilman and Aimone closely mirrors the structure and behavior of cortical networks.\n\n\"We based our circuit on a relatively well-known model in the computational neuroscience world,\" Theilman said. \"We've shown the model has a natural but non-obvious link to PDEs, and that link hasn't been made until now -- 12 years after the model was introduced.\"\n\nThe researchers believe this work could help connect neuroscience with applied mathematics, offering new understanding of how the brain processes information.\n\n\"Diseases of the brain could be diseases of computation,\" Aimone said. \"But we don't have a solid grasp on how the brain performs computations yet.\"\n\nIf that idea proves correct, neuromorphic computing might one day contribute to better understanding and treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n\nBuilding the Next Generation of Supercomputers\n\nNeuromorphic computing remains an emerging field, but this work represents an important step forward. The Sandia team hopes their results will encourage collaboration among mathematicians, neuroscientists and engineers to expand what this technology can achieve.\n\n\"If we've already shown that we can import this relatively basic but fundamental applied math algorithm into neuromorphic -- is there a corresponding neuromorphic formulation for even more advanced applied math techniques?\" Theilman said.\n\nAs development continues, the researchers are optimistic. \"We have a foot in the door for understanding the scientific questions, but also we have something that solves a real problem,\" Theilman said.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Computers usually solve difficult math problems using a lot of power. Neuromorphic computers are special machines designed to work like the human brain, but until now, they were mostly used for simple tasks like recognizing patterns.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories created a new method that lets these brain-inspired computers solve partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs are complicated math problems used to understand things like weather, materials, and physics. Their study, published in Nature Machine Intelligence, shows these machines can handle tough equations efficiently.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because solving PDEs normally needs huge, power-hungry supercomputers. Neuromorphic computers can do it using much less energy. This could help make supercomputers that are both powerful and energy-efficient, which is especially useful for national security tasks like nuclear simulations. It also gives clues about how the brain might perform complex calculations.\n\n**What’s next step** – The researchers want to improve these computers further and encourage teamwork between mathematicians, brain scientists, and engineers. They hope to use more advanced math methods and eventually build neuromorphic supercomputers that help with both science and protecting the country.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Brain-inspired computers can now solve complex scientific math problems using far less energy, opening new paths for powerful and efficient computing.\n",

      "content": "Fodder cutters are fearsome machines with huge circular blades spinning at high speed, powered by small generators. Operated by rural workers in several developing countries, including India, Pakistan and Kenya, they pose a constant risk – many have had hands or arms amputated following accidents.\n\nThe consequences are devastating. Tasks that shape daily life – harvesting crops, kneading dough, stitching embroidery – suddenly become impossible. Thousands of women are left with reduced independence, lost livelihoods, and, too often, social exclusion.\n\nUntil recently, advanced prosthetics were far beyond their reach. Now, homegrown AI tools are opening the door to the same kinds of sophisticated devices available in wealthier countries.\n\nKarachi-based Bioniks Technologies partnered with UN Women to design and deliver prosthetic limbs tailored specifically for affected female workers in Pakistan’s Sindh province. The initiative harnessed frontier technologies – 3D modelling, digital scanning, and artificial intelligence – to create lightweight, durable, and intuitive bionic arms capable of transforming daily life.\n\nUN Women A rural Pakistani woman injured by a fodder cutter.\n\n“Through this collaboration, we provided advanced prosthetic arms, hands-on training, psychological support and awareness sessions to help communities understand safety practices and prevent such injuries in the future,” says Ayesha Zulfiqar, co-founder of Bioniks.\n\n“Watching these incredible women regain their mobility, dignity, independence and return to hand embroidery, their main source of income, has been profoundly inspiring. This is more than technology, it’s restoring hope, confidence and opportunity.”\n\nThe India AI Impact Summit: A first for the Global South\n\nTweet URL\n\nThis initiative is a powerful example of what can be achieved when AI is available to innovators based in the Global South.\n\nDemocratising AI is a major priority for the United Nations, which is working to ensure that this rapidly evolving technology is developed ethically and benefits people everywhere.\n\nAt the India AI Impact Summit, taking place from 16 to 20 February in New Delhi, several UN agencies will showcase the initiatives they are supporting in the country and across developing nations.\n\nThe Summit is the first major event of its kind in the Global South. Building on the momentum of the 2023 AI Safety Summit convened by the UK, and the 2025 AI Action Summit in France, it will also feature UN Secretary‑General António Guterres and Amandeep Gill, his Special Envoy for Digital and Emerging Technologies.\n\nSpeaking to author and podcaster Anirudh Suri in the run-up to the conference, Mr. Gill said that the UN is focused on bridging the growing ‘AI divide’ (between wealthy and developing economies, as well as the rich and poor within countries) and making AI more accessible to people everywhere.\n\n“The concentration of economic and technological power is our biggest concern at the United Nations,” said Mr. Gill. “We’ve seen this story before, during previous industrial revolutions, when those who missed steam power found themselves 50 years behind in terms of development. We cannot afford to let that happen again.”\n\nDespite the fears he expressed, Mr. Gill pointed to regions that have put plans in place to capitalise on AI and avoid being left behind. “I see this in Southeast Asia, in many parts of Africa and in India, where the government is taking the lead, subsidising access to AI for researchers, developers and smaller companies.”\n\nAlthough the AI Impact Summit is not a UN event, Mr. Gill has been involved in shaping the agenda and considers it to be an important moment on the path to international governance. “It’s exciting to see the focus on bridging the AI divide, building capacity and involving citizens in a democratic approach to the technology.”",
