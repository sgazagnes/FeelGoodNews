      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 02 September 2025; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-02753-xScientists are tinkering with plant genes to create crops that seed their own clones, with a host of benefits for farmers.",
      "content": "As early as next month, a trial crop of hardy sorghum could start sprouting under a mesh containment canopy in eastern Australia. The plants might seem ordinary, but there’s something revolutionary hiding in their genes.\n\nIf the trial is a success, each plant will bypass sexual reproduction and will set seed to thousands of clones in each flower head.\n\nThe Hy-Gain sorghum trial is the culmination of decades of work for plant physiologist Anna Koltunow at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, who began research to make ‘sexless seeds’ in the early 1990s. The technology exploits a quirk of nature — known as apomixis. More than 300 species of flowering plant naturally produce clonal seeds through apomixis, but none are important grains. Researchers say that the quest to bring apomixis to plants such as sorghum, rice and maize (corn) is now on the brink of transforming agriculture.\n\nHow to climate-proof crops: scientists say the secret’s in the dirt\n\n“It definitely will lead to a revolution,” says Kejian Wang, a geneticist at the China National Rice Research Institute in Hangzhou, who is working on separate apomixis experiments.\n\nKoltunow says her work promises to give smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa access to affordable high-yielding sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) crops. Those farmers could save the clonal seeds to sow for several years, further reducing costs. These are some of the reasons that Koltunow’s research is supported by the Gates Foundation, a charity in Seattle, Washington.\n\nAnother collaborator in the Hy-Gain project is the multinational seed company Corteva Agriscience, based in Indianapolis, Indiana. That’s because apomictic plants are a potential boon for seed companies selling to large-scale agriculture markets across the world. Apomixis could slash the time needed to create new varieties, and fix desirable traits in plants that produce their own clones. “The decrease in cost [could be] huge,” for those companies, says Koltunow.\n\nMarket-ready clonal seed production is within reach in a handful of species, including rice — a staple grain that feeds more than half of the world’s population. There has been a flurry of patent applications in the past few years for a variety of apomictic crop plants. Yet researchers say that some key hurdles remain before these advances can truly take root. “Now that we’ve gotten it to work as a concept, we need to fine tune things,” says Venkatesan Sundaresan, a plant reproductive biologist at the University of California, Davis.\n\nFixing vigour\n\nThe arrival of sexless seeds for growing crops could transform much of agriculture, foremost the production of hybrid seeds. For some of the main crops grown across the world, such as maize, rice and tomatoes, farmers have been sowing hybrid seed for generations.\n\nWhen two parent varieties are crossed through sexual reproduction, the resulting hybrid offspring typically outperform both of their parents — a phenomenon known as hybrid vigour. Between 1930 and the mid-1990s, yields from maize crops in the United States increased sevenfold, partly because farmers adopted the practice of sowing hybrid seeds to produce row after row of uniformly robust plants.\n\nBut making hybrids is laborious, time-consuming and expensive, and hybrid seeds must be created — and purchased — anew each year. That’s because if hybrids are left to self-pollinate, they produce a mish-mash crop of plants of varying quality, the result of sexual reproduction mixing and matching the plant’s genes into new combinations (see ‘Creating cloned crops’).\n\nSource: Wang, Y. & Underwood, C. J. Curr. Biol. 33, R293–R295 (2023)\n\nWith apomixis, hybrid vigour would be ‘fixed’ in place, because the hybrids would clone themselves, providing breeders — and farmers — with an endless supply of high-quality, identical plants. This could also help in the production of crops such as wheat and soya bean, for which it has proven too difficult to produce hybrids. Apomixis would make it possible to develop elite varieties of these crops in which traits are fixed from one generation to the next.\n\nBy the 1940s, researchers had worked out that apomixis had a genetic basis. But it wasn’t until the 1990s that Koltunow and others recognized that the trait doesn’t override sexual reproduction. Rather, it is “a kind of altered sexual pathway”, says Ueli Grossniklaus, a plant geneticist at the University of Zürich, Switzerland. In that pathway, two innovations are necessary: the cell divisions during the formation of egg and sperm cells need to be disrupted; and an embryo needs to form independently of fertilization. Grossniklaus’s team conducted several experiments in which plants were deliberately mutated to see whether any mutants exhibited these changes.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2009 that researchers successfully disrupted the sexual cell-division process, known as meiosis, to mimic what occurs in natural apomicts1. Raphael Mercier, a plant geneticist then at the National Institute for Agricultural Research in Versaille, France, was trying to understand how mitosis — the simple process in which a cell divides into two identical cells — evolved into the more complex cellular dance of meiosis, a key part of sexual reproduction. Meiosis involves two cell divisions instead of one, and the resulting egg and sperm cells contain half the usual number of chromosomes, so that when combined during fertilization, the full complement of chromosomes is restored.\n\nUsing Arabidopsis thaliana, a small cabbage relative that has become the workhorse of plant genetics laboratories, Mercier identified a gene involved in one of the three crucial innovations that turned mitosis into meiosis during evolution. He then disrupted that gene, along with genes that are crucial for the other two pillars of meiosis, to see whether meiosis could be turned back into mitosis.\n\nHow farming could become the ultimate climate-change tool\n\n“It worked just [as] expected,” says Mercier, now at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany. In flowers of the resulting triple mutant — dubbed MiMe, for mitosis instead of meiosis — sperm and egg cells contained the same set of chromosomes as their parent, having been made through the simpler cell division of mitosis rather than the more complex meiosis1. Mercier says that he immediately recognized the potential of MiMe for engineering apomixis in plants. He and his colleagues followed up with MiMe rice2 in 2016, and MiMe tomatoes3 in 2024. The plants could reproduce, but because the egg and sperm cells contained twice the normal number of chromosomes, the progeny also received a double dose of chromosomes, leading to decreasing fertility in each generation. It was a step in the right direction but only half of the apomixis puzzle.\n\nGrossniklaus and his team discovered an alternative to MiMe in maize. A screen of 60,000 mutants turned up a single gene, called non-reductive in female4 (nrf4), that, when disrupted, causes about one-third of egg cells to be formed through mitosis instead of meiosis. This work, including the formation of the first clonal seed in a crop species using the nrf4 mutant, is covered by a patent4.\n\nVirgin birth\n\nThe second essential component of apomixis is parthenogenesis, by which an embryo forms directly from an unfertilized egg cell — no male required. In 2006, Peggy Ozias-Akins, a molecular geneticist at the University of Georgia in Tifton, and her colleagues focused on fountain grass (Cenchrus squamulatus) — a natural apomict — which looked like a good candidate for containing an apomixis gene5. The gene they identified was similar to BABY BOOM, which can provoke plant tissue to spontaneously form embryos. But it took Ozias-Akins’s group almost a decade to confirm their hunch about the gene’s role in apomixis. They introduced the fountain grass gene into pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) — which reproduces sexually — and discovered that embryos spontaneously developed without fertilization6. “That was pretty exciting,” says Ozias-Akins.\n\nAn international team of researchers has created a type of sorghum that can reproduce asexually and will be testing it soon in a field trial in Australia.Credit: Getty\n\nMeanwhile, Sundaresan was zeroing in on BABY BOOM from an entirely different direction. “My lab really was not working on apomixis at all,” he says. Instead, his group was looking for genes that are active during the crucial transition from an unfertilized egg cell to a fertilized one that can develop into an embryo.\n\nWorking with rice, Sundaresan’s team extracted RNA — the read-out product of active genes — from individual egg cells in the hours immediately following pollination. They found that BABY BOOM RNA was abundant. Sundaresan’s group went on to show that BABY BOOM was acting as a trigger for embryogenesis, and the active copy of the gene was delivered to the egg cell by the sperm7. Next, Sundaresan and his colleague Imtiyaz Khanday, an agronomist at the University of California, Davis, showed that the sperm wasn’t required at all. They inserted a copy of the BABY BOOM gene with instructions to switch on in the egg cell — where its own copy of the gene is silenced. With this technique, the team set embryogenesis in motion8.\n\nPutting it all together\n\nAfter Sundaresan learnt about the MiMe rice work in 2016, he contacted Mercier to collaborate on combining MiMe and BABY BOOM. They edited the MiMe genes in rice containing egg-cell-active BABY BOOM. In doing so, they achieved the long-sought goal of the field: an apomictic plant that propagates clones of itself8. Although the efficiency was poor — only 10–30% of seeds were clonal — the work provided a proof-of-concept for combining the two essential elements of apomixis in a valuable crop species.",

      "content": "Despite serving a valuable purpose to us all, tech companies face increasing scrutiny as they consume ever-larger amounts of electricity. The artificial intelligence boom has made questions about the environmental impact of digital technology increasingly relevant in everyday conversation because the demand for energy in data centers will raise energy prices for all.\n\nData centers are the backbone of the internet. Keeping AI models and the new digital services they offer just a click away requires exponentially more electricity than earlier technologies. The rapid growth of AI-powered data centers is creating unprecedented stress on electrical grids. There were 5,426 data centers nationally as of March 2025, and the number is skyrocketing. Collectively, these centers consumed about 17 gigawatts (GW) of power in 2022, up from 7.9 GW in 2014 (for context, a large nuclear power plant generates about 1 GW), according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.\n\nWhile a transition to diverse clean energy sources is underway, including controversial nuclear power investments, the rapid growth of AI has fundamentally altered the sustainability landscape for cloud computing providers.\n\nThe AI-Fueled Energy Crisis\n\nData centers accounted for about 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024, and demand is expected to double by 2030 because of artificial intelligence, according to recent analysis by Scientific American. We must look beyond efficiency improvements, which can no longer offset rising demand.\n\nThe scale of AI’s energy appetite is staggering. AI-specific servers in these data centers are estimated to have used between 53 and 76 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024 alone, enough to power more than 7.2 million U.S. homes for a year, according to an MIT Technology Review analysis.\n\nChina and the United States are the most significant consumers of data center power, accounting for nearly 80% of global growth expected by 2030. Consumption is expected to increase by around 240 TWh (+130%) in the United States, compared to the 2024 level, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports.\n\nThe Nuclear Pivot?\n\nFaced with massive and growing energy demands, major technology companies have made a controversial pivot toward nuclear power, a dramatic shift from their previous focus on wind and solar energy alone.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are exploring or investing in nuclear power projects. Driven by the energy demands of their data centers and AI models, their announcements mark the beginning of an industrywide trend, CNBC reported in late 2024.\n\nIn September 2024, Microsoft signed an agreement to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Google recently announced several nuclear initiatives, including a 50-megawatt nuclear power deal to supply data centers in Tennessee and Alabama.\n\nGoogle and Amazon have invested in nuclear reactors that will use tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel: golf ball-size graphite spheres packed with uranium, carbon, and oxygen, IEEE Spectrum reports. Amazon also made substantial nuclear commitments, including a $650 million deal for a data center powered by one of the largest U.S. nuclear plants, according to Trellis reporting.\n\nNuclear Regulation In Flux\n\nHowever, these nuclear ambitions face regulatory challenges. The Trump Administration is pushing an aggressive nuclear energy expansion strategy that could significantly reshape America’s clean energy landscape. The Trump Administration is moving forward with an aggressive nuclear energy expansion strategy in 2025 that could dramatically reshape America’s clean energy landscape. Through a series of executive orders, the Administration has set an ambitious target to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity from 100 GW to 400 GW by 2050, a move that supporters argue could dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the power sector. As part of this nuclear revival, the Administration has directed the Army to build a new reactor within three years that will power energy-intensive artificial intelligence systems and critical defense infrastructure. This policy shift includes streamlining the Nuclear Regulatory Commission review process to accelerate deployment of next-generation reactor technologies, including small modular reactors that promise enhanced safety and flexibility.\n\nEnvironmental groups remain divided on nuclear power’s role in combating climate change. Outwardly, the Trump Administration’s nuclear aspirations represent one of the most significant federal commitments to carbon-free baseload power in decades, albeit far behind the scope of the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable goals. The new rules position nuclear energy as a cornerstone of America’s transition away from fossil fuels, but the Administration’s commitment to oil remains firm.\n\nRenewable Energy: Still Growing Despite Nuclear Pivot\n\nWhile nuclear power captures headlines, renewable energy continues to expand dramatically. Wind and solar dominate annual U.S. electricity capacity expansion through mid-2025, and the global renewable energy sector continues its rapid expansion. In fact, global energy investment was expected to exceed $3 trillion for the first time in 2024, and $2 trillion was dedicated to clean energy technologies and infrastructure, according to IEA reports.\n\nSolar and wind make up nearly 91% of new power capacity introduced through May 2025. For example, Meta announced almost 800 megawatts (MW) of wind and solar power generation investment as part of its plan to reach net-zero emissions across its entire value chain by 2030.\n\nGoogle maintains its position as the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally. It is participating in numerous utility-scale wind and solar energy projects across the globe. Google, along with Facebook and Apple, was among the first corporations to make 100 percent renewable energy commitments several years ago. These companies haven’t abandoned their renewable energy commitments, but they’ve adjusted their rhetoric and are pursuing a “clean energy portfolio” approach that includes both renewables and nuclear power.\n\nMeanwhile, regional challenges persist that will create the opportunity for breaking with environmental norms. Data center energy use has already surpassed 10% of electricity consumption in some areas, according to IEA analysis. Google faces shortages in renewable energy in local markets, particularly in “Data Center Alley” in Northern Virginia, where data centres account for between 2% and 4% of total electricity consumption today. The primary electric utility provider in Northern Virginia, Dominion Energy, still relies heavily on fracked gas, coal, and other fossil fuels. However, pressure from major tech customers is driving gradual changes.\n\nThe Path Forward: Diversified Energy Strategy\n\nThe AI revolution has fundamentally changed the energy equation for cloud computing. While renewable energy investments continue to grow at a record pace, the geopolitical competition over AI capabilities and megaprojects, such as the $500 billion U.S. Stargate initiative or France’s €109 billion investment in data centers, will require at least 5 GW in new generation capacity. The energy imperative has led to a more pragmatic approach where companies are pursuing multiple energy sources simultaneously. Technology companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta hope nuclear power will offer a climate solution for this energy use. Nuclear power plants can deliver hundreds of megawatts of power without producing greenhouse gas emissions, NPR reports, though long-time industry observers remain skeptical about execution timelines.\n\nCustomer Power and Future Outlook\n\nAs each of us makes choices about which technologies to use and how much to rely on AI in our work and life, we must make our preferences known to the major tech platform companies. As Gary Cook of Greenpeace emphasized when he discussed advocacy efforts with Earth911, “IT companies care about what their customers think. Companies need to hear from customers demanding that they care about climate change and to fuel their operations with renewable energy.”\n\nThe scale of AI’s energy demands has created a new reality where companies are pursuing all available zero-carbon options, including controversial nuclear power, alongside massive renewable energy investments. It remains to be seen if we are rushing into new environmental crises. The Department of Energy is actively assessing center energy demand to help guide policy responses to this unprecedented challenge, which will create an opportunity for public comment.\n\nThe next few years will be critical in determining whether the technology sector can scale clean energy fast enough to meet AI’s exponential growth in energy demands while maintaining progress toward global climate goals. But consumers are not powerless spectators in this process—they have direct influence.\n\nOne example is the work of Consumers International, which leads the Clean Energy Futures program; it is designed to empower ordinary people to participate in the clean energy transition. Their recently launched Impact Initiative: Amplifying Consumer Voices in the Clean Energy Transition highlights grassroots actions—such as community campaigns, school-led initiatives, and public petitions—that have successfully pressured policymakers and companies to adopt cleaner practices.\n\nYou can get involved by reading Consumers International’s Maximising consumer voices in digital financial services policy-making report to explore how others are having an impact in the data center electricity debate. Then, take action through local campaigns, sign petitions, or partner with consumer organizations to push for renewable energy adoption.\n\nEditor’s note: Originally published on June 29, 2018, this article was substantially updated in September 2025.",

      "content": "Earlier this summer, the Banana Lake Fire erupted near Plains, Montana, engulfing over 850 acres in flames within a day. The “total suppression” response from firefighting officials included deploying at least 17 engines, two helicopters, and three bulldozers, as well as highly trained fire crews. But another newer piece of technology was also at play as firefighters worked to contain the blaze: drones.\n\nBanana Lake was one of several early-season fires in the state this year. As of this writing, there are over 20,000 acres burning across seven key wildfires in Montana, at varying levels of containment. And increasingly hot and dry conditions throughout the American West are making fire an ever more fickle foe.\n\nAs a new era with the natural disaster commences, both fire practitioners and researchers across the West are bolstering their arsenal with cutting-edge tools. Drones now fly above firefighters, private satellite companies monitor fire and smoke from above, and AI machine-learning models are helping to advance fire research. While these new innovations are not panaceas, ground operations crews and scientists are optimistic about the ways modern technology can help fight fire smarter, not harder.\n\nSince 2018, drones — sometimes referred to as unmanned aerial systems, or UAS — have been flying under the radar as a new instrument for the United States Forest Service in the fight against wildfire. Thanks in large part to Dirk Giles, who launched and leads the agency’s UAS program, the number of drones deployed each year by the Forest Service has jumped from 734 flights in 2019 to over 17,000 in 2024.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\n“The program has really hit a new stride in the past three years,” said Giles. “We are seeing UAS supplementing fire crews across all phases of response.”\n\n\n\n“This UAS program is now being recognized as prolific,” said Ry Phipps, a division supervisor in Region 1 of the Forest Service, which includes Montana. “There was a time we wouldn’t have even thought to try and order a drone for operations. They have become a fantastic tool that is changing the game.”\n\nA UAS pilot from the U.S. Forest Service flies a drone using a handheld control system on the Banana Lake wildfire outside of Plains, Montana, on June 6. The pilot is looking for hotspot locations using thermal imagery, which are then passed onto firefighting crews on the ground. John Stember\n\nAccording to Phipps, drones are increasingly seen as a force multiplier by Forest Service employees. Drones equipped with infrared sensors can help detect lingering hot spots, pinpointing areas at risk for reigniting. Previously, firefighters had to meticulously hand-check burn scars, which could take days at a time and a ton of manpower depending on the size of the area. With supervisors like Phipps reading a thermal map on a screen fed by drone data, firefighters with boots on the ground can be dispatched more safely and efficiently, only going to spots that have high heat signatures.\n\n\n\n“It saves a lot of time and risk for crews,” said Phipps.\n\n\n\nFor helicopter pilots, who help control wildfires by dropping water or fire retardant to suppress flames and creating fire lines for ground crews to control blazes, drones can also assist. Preprogrammed flight trajectories in combination with infrared sensors allow UAS to fly through heavy smoke or at night. This mitigates the need for “low and slow” reconnaissance missions, which require pilots to fly close to the ground in tricky terrain and low visibility. According to Giles, these missions are some of the most dangerous for wildland fire pilots. As their name would suggest, unmanned aerial systems offer a way to do surveillance without putting pilots in danger — which means that UAS can unlock new abilities for fire crews in extreme conditions.\n\n“Basically, you can fly drones so that nobody gets hurt,” said Phipps. “You can replace a drone. You can’t replace a person.”\n\nAlthough Giles, Phipps, and others believe that drones show great promise — especially in shifting risk from firefighters to a machine the size of a small cooler — they’re far from being a silver bullet. The machines have limited battery life and can only complete flights of about 15 minutes on average, meaning that deployments must be carefully planned. And since drones are still being studied in various fire management applications, manpower is still needed to check the “ground truth” of information that UAS provide.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nAnother limitation is simply availability. According to Phipps, there aren’t as many drones as there is demand for them.\n\nIronically, there’s also an emerging risk from privately owned drones getting in the way of official operations. If hobby drones are in the airspace near a wildfire, it’s also a no-go for land management agencies to fly. During a wildfire in Montana in 2022, aerial crew operations came to a standstill as an unapproved drone buzzed right into an area with a temporary flight restriction. Officials were able to locate the drone’s owner in just about 15 minutes — but that’s precious time when a fire is raging.\n\nAnd just two weeks ago during a wildfire near Provo, Utah, fire operations were shut down by multiple drone incursions, impeding fire management on a high-profile fire near a densely populated community. While UAS are becoming more critical in fire operations, officials must also work on educating civilians to ensure unauthorized drones don’t prevent them from flying their own.\n\nGrayback Forestry firefighters working on the Banana Lake Fire walk through the forest in a line and kneel down to feel for hotspots with their hands. Although the wildfire already burned through the area, small fires can burn underground or in tree root systems. Ground crews work in conjunction with drone pilots, who can detect hotspots using thermal imagery. John Stember\n\nAnother area of fire management that drones have shown shown some promise in is lighting and managing controlled burns — intentional blazes set to clear dry brush and other fuels.\n\nFire management’s history of suppression disrupted the natural fire cycles that Indigenous communities once stewarded — cycles that many ecologists now champion. As colonization spread across the West and settlers sought to control land and resources, racist assimilation programs criminalized all manner of Indigenous customs. Prescribed burning was one of them.\n\nBut as the consequences of this more aggressive, reactive approach to fire management have become apparent, Western science has increasingly caught on to the effectiveness of routine controlled burning. One recent Stanford-led study revealed that prescribed burns can reduce the severity of subsequent wildfires by an average of 16 percent and net smoke pollution by 14 percent. Fire professionals have also recognized their potential, with applications growing year over year.\n\nEnter another new breed of drones: UAS that can be equipped to carry “dragon eggs,” pingpong ball-sized clusters of a flammable potassium concoction that ignite on impact. This innovation helped the Forest Service burn around 189,000 acres in 2024 to reduce built-up fuels.\n\nWhile the use of prescribed burns is on the rise, in Montana and elsewhere, concerns remain about public safety risks, both from air pollution and the possibility of blazes getting out of control. Technology is helping to address those kinds of questions, too.\n\nResearchers in Montana are looking to clear some of the lingering haze of safety concerns around prescribed burns through a National Science Foundation-funded project titled SMART FIRES. (The project’s title is an acronym for Sensors, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence in Real Time Fire Science.) The group, specializing in fields from atmospheric chemistry to public health, will use the grant to conduct five years of study and fieldwork aimed at unpacking the environmental and social dynamics needed to scale prescribed burns as a preventative measure for wildfire. The suite of custom gadgets that the project is utilizing includes some proprietary UAS.\n\n“Drones are just a tool,” said John Sheppard, who leads SMART FIRES’ AI computer science team. He added that his role in the project is a supportive one — to see how these technological tools can further the various research aims.\n\nUsing smart sensors and high-resolution cameras fastened on drones and ground sites, the researchers are training AI models to analyze prescribed burns on the fly. The different smart sensors will efficiently process real-time data, and in combination with weather and historical fire information, they will look to model a burn’s movement on the landscape.\n\nBefore conducting a prescribed burn, practitioners usually carefully examine environmental factors like wind, humidity, and temperature. These AI models will theoretically offer an enhanced version of that, also incorporating factors like ground fuels and topography to provide supervisors with the best possible data to burn accurately and safely.\n\nSMART FIRES also touts a “science lab on wheels” — a tricked-out Ford Transit van that looks right off a Ghostbusters movie set. The van collects smoke directly from active fires, which environmental chemists then analyze to determine things like the level of PM2.5 — particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns, a concern for public health — and other pollutants present in the smoke.\n\nThe social science arm of the project will also engage community members, surveying rural and Indigenous communities in particular about their concerns and priorities related to prescribed burns and ensuring these considerations are put into risk assessments. The consortium ultimately hopes to provide interpretable, map-based forecasts to land managers to help them decide when, where, and how prescribed burns can be used for wildfire prevention.\n\n“The goal of the project is to refine the AI models so that they can give better recommendations to experts on the ground who know best,” said Sheppard.\n\nWhile drones and AI are opening up a new era for fire science and management, some of the most tenured experts on the ground have yet to gain access to these types of cutting-edge tools.\n\nThe Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana, sometimes known by the acronym CSKT, have practiced prescribed burns as a tool for land stewardship since time immemorial. According to Ron Swaney, the fire management officer of the CSKT Division of Fire, the role of fire has long been guided by a deep cultural responsibility. “I think a lot of people underestimate the role of Indigenous burning on the landscape,” he said. “There was purpose and intent for that use of fire.”\n\nJustin Underwood, the CSKT prescribed fire and fuel specialist, has been in fire management for 19 years and was the first UAS pilot to be certified under the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Pacific Northwest region. For three years, he has been trying to get a drone for the tribes’ prescribed burn operations. But because he isn’t employed by the Department of the Interior, he has yet to cut through the red tape.\n\nThe Office of Aviation Services, which lives within the U.S. Department of the Interior, is responsible for all aircraft services and facilities — including the certification card needed for flying a UAS. According to Swaney, the tribe has a helicopter, two single-engine air tankers, and an air attack platform for firefighting. But because drones are a newer implementation in fire management, nonfederal fire divisions may run up against a convoluted process to get clearance to use a UAS.\n\n“I wouldn’t be so frustrated if my qualifications didn’t mirror other pilots,” said Underwood. “I’ve done every training offered by the Department of the Interior, but I am still unsure what it will take to get officially carded for a UAS.”\n\nWhile the CSKT coordinates with public land agencies on prescribed burns, the tribal nation sets its own fire management plan — one part of a larger plan focused on climate change adaptation. The tribe’s approach to fire weaves together ancestral knowledge and contemporary science. But being unable to utilize the latest technological tools has hampered these efforts, Swaney said, underscoring just how important the role of technology is in present and future fire management.\n\n“It’s like living in the dark ages,” said Swaney.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Wildfires like the Banana Lake Fire in Montana can burn hundreds of acres quickly, threatening communities and forests. Fighting these fires is difficult and dangerous, especially as hot, dry weather increases fire risks in the western United States.\n\n**What happened** – Since 2018, the U.S. Forest Service has been using drones, also called unmanned aerial systems (UAS), to help fight wildfires. Led by Dirk Giles, the program grew from 734 drone flights in 2019 to over 17,000 in 2024. These drones carry special cameras that detect hot spots and help firefighters work more safely and efficiently. They can fly through smoke or at night, reducing risks for helicopter pilots. Drones also assist with controlled burns, dropping small fire-starting balls called “dragon eggs” to clear dry brush.\n\n**Impact** – Using drones and artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how wildfires are managed. Drones save time and reduce danger by finding hidden fires quickly, so firefighters only go where needed. AI models analyze data from drones and sensors to predict how controlled burns will spread, making these burns safer and more effective. This technology also helps reduce the size and smoke of future wildfires. However, not all firefighters and tribal groups have easy access to drones yet, and unauthorized hobby drones can disrupt operations.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers are working on a five-year project called SMART FIRES to improve AI tools that guide fire management.

      "summary": "Scrap cars could be used to build new electric vehicles thanks to a new process for turning various aluminium alloys into a strong and mouldable metal",
      "content": "Scrap cars could be used to build new electric vehicles thanks to a new process for turning various aluminium alloys into a strong and mouldable metal\n\nScrap vehicles contain many different metal alloys, which can be hard to recycle Marc Hill/Alamy\n\nA new way to recycle the metal from scrap cars could eliminate millions of tonnes of waste each year and cut the carbon emissions from producing virgin aluminium.\n\nFor decades, much of the scrap aluminium in cars has been recycled into a low-grade cast alloy for use as engine blocks in new combustion engines. But as the car industry transitions to building only electric vehicles, there is nowhere for this low-grade scrap metal to go.\n\nWithout a solution, the world risks creating “mountains” of unusable scrap and emitting millions of tonnes of additional carbon dioxide by producing more virgin aluminium for vehicle manufacturing, warns Stefan Pogatscher at the University of Leoben in Austria.\n\n“If the engine blocks go away because of electrification, at the moment we have no sink for the scrap,” he warns. “That means it cannot be used any more.”\n\nTogether with colleagues, Pogatscher has developed a new process to recycle the metal from scrap cars – which in Europe alone amounts to between 7 and 9 million tonnes of waste per year – into a new high-grade aluminium alloy that can be used to make a variety of components for new cars.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThe solution lies in retaining a wide range of alloy materials from scrap cars to make the new product, he explains.\n\nNormally, when cars are scrapped the materials are sorted, with plastics, fabrics, steels and aluminium all dealt with separately. Next, the aluminium alloys – of which there can be up to 40 in a single car – are separated as much as possible for different recycling streams. What can’t be separated is then melted and cast into engine blocks, a component of combustion engines.\n\nThe new recycling method developed by Pogatscher’s team involves melting down all of the scrap aluminium from an old car in one go, therefore including a much wider range of alloys and impurities than standard.\n\nThis produces a slab of very brittle material that is “more like a ceramic than like a metal”, says Pogatscher. But the team found that reheating this material to about 500°C, for a 24-hour period, helps to change the structure of the metal to make it stronger and more mouldable. “You turn out in the end with mechanical properties that are in some cases better than what is out there for primary-made wrought alloys,” he says.\n\nThe team claims the new material rivals typical automotive alloys with its “impressive” strength and could be used to make a wide range of car parts, including chassis and frames. It can be made using common industrial processes and therefore could be immediately scalable, says Pogatscher. He admits that it will be challenging to get the “conservative” manufacturing sector to adopt the new alloy at scale, but the research team is already in talks with industry partners about developing the process.\n\nGeoffrey Scamans at Brunel University of London says although the idea is “very interesting”, more work is needed to prove that the new alloy can pass the stringent tests necessary to allow its use in car body parts, for example.\n\nHe also warns it may prove challenging to produce a consistent high-grade alloy given that vehicles are scrapped “at random and not as individual vehicle types”. “It’s difficult to see how the individual alloy compositions could be collected in a practical way,” he says. “Scaling from lab-scale experiments to full-scale production of sheet [metal] is notoriously difficult.”\n\nMark Schlesinger at the Missouri University of Science and Technology says the content of the new alloy will need to be specified and controlled if it is to be commercially produced. “Simply throwing scrap into a furnace at random and melting it down will not produce an acceptable product,” he says. “This means that identification of the chemistry of scrap will still be needed, raising the cost of processing it.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**  \nScrap cars contain many different types of metals, especially aluminium alloys. Recycling these metals has been difficult because the alloys are mixed together. Most scrap aluminium has been reused only for low-quality parts like engine blocks in traditional cars. But as car makers switch to electric vehicles, these low-quality uses are disappearing. This creates a problem: millions of tonnes of scrap metal might go to waste, and making new aluminium releases a lot of carbon dioxide.\n\n**What happened**  \nScientists at the University of Leoben in Austria have developed a new way to recycle all the mixed aluminium alloys from scrap cars at once. They melt the scrap metal together, creating a brittle material. Then, by reheating it for a day at about 500°C, they make the metal strong and easy to shape. This new alloy is as strong as the best metals used in cars today and can be used to make many parts, like frames and chassis. The method uses common industrial tools and could be scaled up quickly.\n\n**Impact**  \nThis process could help reduce millions of tonnes of scrap metal waste each year in Europe alone. It also lowers the need to produce new aluminium, which cuts carbon emissions. Instead of throwing away or downcycling scrap metal, car makers could reuse it to build electric vehicles. This supports a cleaner and more sustainable car industry as it changes from petrol to electric vehicles.\n\n**What's next step**  \nThe research team is talking with companies to test and improve the new metal for real car parts. Experts say more testing is needed to make sure the metal is reliable and safe for vehicles. Also, sorting scrap metal to keep the right mix of alloys will still be important to make the process work well and keep costs down.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**  \nA new recycling process can turn mixed scrap aluminium from old cars into strong metal for electric vehicles, reducing waste and carbon emissions.\n",
