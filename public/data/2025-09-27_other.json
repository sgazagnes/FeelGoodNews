      "content": "How the King’s vision is shaping next wave of new towns\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save\n\nPA Media/Alastair Grant The King, accompanied by Sir Keir Starmer, speaks to construction workers at Nansledan earlier this year\n\nThe urban planning ideas of King Charles - which once saw him battling with the architectural establishment - are helping to inspire the next generation of new towns in England, imminently expected to be announced by the government. The housing ministry's head of placemaking, Biljana Savic, told a King's Foundation event about plans for new towns that share much in common with the King's traditional town-building philosophy. The 12 new towns will be walkable and environmentally friendly, with \"gentle density\" such as \"terraced housing and mansion blocks\" rather than high-rise. TV architect George Clarke says the King's views on buildings have now become part of the mainstream.\n\nGetty Images TV architect George Clarke says the King's traditional town-building philosophy has become part of the mainstream\n\n\"He was absolutely slammed down by the architectural establishment,\" said Clarke of the King's attacks on some modern design plans, such as in 1984 calling a proposed extension to the National Gallery a \"monstrous carbuncle\". But Clarke says there has been a sea-change and younger architects are much more empathetic about producing buildings that are sensitive to the local place and the likes and dislikes of the public. \"Let's be honest, the enormous mass of 1960s brutalism was devastating for parts of Britain,\" said the TV presenter. \"Too many modern designs had been 'ego-driven' and the architectural arrogance was off the scale,\" he said. Clarke now warns that too many people are having to \"mortgage themselves up to the hilt\" for homes on new estates that are not always well built and with poor access to local services. \"I would live in one of the King's houses on one of his estates, which are really well designed, traditional pieces of architecture, sustainably done, high quality windows, with beautiful public spaces, places for kids to play, pedestrianised areas, village greens,\" said Clarke. The TV architect grew up in council housing in a new town, Washington, in the north-east of England, which he said was a \"very humane piece of design\". \"It wasn't streets in the sky. It wasn't concrete carbuncles, it wasn't anything ugly like that. There were simple, low density houses, amazing landscaping, brand new highways,\" which he said provided a \"fantastic place to live\".\n\nGetty Images The King's new town schemes, such as Nansledan in Cornwall, include creating public spaces which help to support a sense of community\n\nHugh Hastings/Getty Images A view of some social housing in Nansledan, pictured in 2021\n\nThe King's support for traditional building styles, and his idea of \"harmony\" with nature, have helped to shape his own new town schemes, including Poundbury in Dorset and Nansledan in Cornwall. They emphasise a walkable layout, using local building materials and creating public spaces which help to support a sense of community. Inside King Charles's Harmony Summit that shone a light on his beliefs Although the traditional style had been attacked by some critics as inauthentic and backwards looking. The government said it had received more than a hundred proposed sites for new towns, each expected to have a population of 10,000 or more, as part of its drive to create 1.5 million new homes.\n\nThe final selection of locations is expected to be revealed very soon, but Ms Savic, who once worked for the King's charities, set out the challenges and the framework for how they might be designed. Previous waves of new towns had been \"responses to overcrowding and economic imbalance in the post-war period; they offered affordable homes, green spaces and a sense of community\", she said at an event run by the King's Foundation, a charity which promotes sustainability and protecting traditional craft and building skills. But Ms Savic said the post-war new towns \"taught us very hard lessons\" about being built too much around cars, a lack of maintenance of public spaces, poor transport links, a lack of social life and insufficient jobs.\n\nAdrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images Poundbury, pictured here in 2023, sits on the western outskirts of Dorchester in the county of Dorset\n\nKiran Ridley/Getty Images A street party in the small town of Poundbury to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla\n\nThe new towns will have a \"design code\" for buildings to create an identity. They will be walkable, with a goal of \"environmental sustainability\", and with a significant proportion of affordable housing, said the ministry official. This will mean a \"compact\" design with \"higher density, but not necessarily in the form of high-rise buildings, but gentle density models that we are familiar with, such as terraced housing and mansion blocks,\" she said. The purpose was to turn \"housing into homes and sites into communities\", she said. The King's Foundation event, held at Hatfield House, heard from more planners about how other new developments had been inspired.\n\nGetty Images Seaside, Florida, used for The Truman Show, borrowed ideas from King Charles",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – King Charles has long shared strong opinions about how towns and buildings should be designed. Although his ideas were once criticized by experts, they are now influencing new town projects in England.\n\n**What happened** – The UK government is planning to build 12 new towns inspired by the King’s traditional style of town planning. These towns will focus on being walkable, environmentally friendly, and built with “gentle density,” meaning houses like terraced homes and mansion blocks instead of tall skyscrapers. Officials from the housing ministry explained these plans at an event hosted by the King’s Foundation.\n\n**Impact** – This approach is different from many past developments that focused too much on cars and had poorly maintained public spaces. The new towns will use local materials, include public areas for community activities, and offer more affordable homes. TV architect George Clarke praised the King’s designs for being high quality, sustainable, and creating places where people want to live and children can play safely.\n\n**What’s next step** – The government has received over 100 proposals for new town sites, each expected to house at least 10,000 people. Soon, they will announce which locations will be chosen to start building these new communities that blend traditional design with modern needs.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – King Charles’s long-held ideas on building towns are now shaping new English communities that are greener, more walkable, and focused on people’s quality of life.",

So, if you need just another little bit of an incentive, there it is!\n\nKarissa:\n\nPerfect for fall… and oh, fall is here, and it has me tired.\n\nArielle:\n\nOh, no.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThe autumnal equinox was this past week, so, kind of cool. We wrote an article about the fun moon stuff going on at this time of year. And pumpkin spice is back! We mentioned that… leaves are changing, but it has me really… tired.\n\nArielle:\n\nAre you feeling just under the weather as well, or…?\n\nKarissa:\n\nNot really under the weather, just, uh, just tired.\n\nThe weather, at least where I live, has been super hot but rainy. And usually in California, that’s not at all what happens. It’s either one or the other. That’s kind of been my I’m an Optimist, but… of the entire week.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, I guess it’s just a bit unexpected for your body.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. It’s so unexpected. And pairing that with just, I mean, we talk about this all the time, but what’s going on in the world, it just has me in a weird funk.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, I totally get that. My, I’m an Optimist, but… actually stems from me trying to, like, take my mind off what’s going on on land. Yeah, earlier this week, my partner and I were just like, okay, let’s just watch a nature documentary and just chill. So, he actually chose The Shark Whisperer on Netflix\n\nKarissa:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nArielle:\n\nAnd we really thought it was going to be like David Attenborough-esque calming narration about sharks.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nHave you seen This Karissa?\n\nKarissa:\n\nNo, I haven’t.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, it’s… it’s amazing. It’s really not what I was expecting, and it wasn’t super relaxing I have to say…\n\nKarissa:\n\nOh no!\n\nArielle:\n\nI don’t want to give away any spoilers, but yeah, I highly recommend. It’s about this conservationist… a shark conservationist named Ocean Ramsey, and I think I can say this without giving anything away, but she literally swims with sharks, like without a cage. She, like, becomes friends with them.\n\nBasically, her and her romantic partner, I forget his name…. I think it’s Juan. But they’re just… out there. Swimming with the sharks. But it brings a lot of attention to the plight of the sharks.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nAnd how so many species are going extinct or endangered because of really horrible fishing practices and things like shark finning, and that just made me really sad. She does present sharks in a different way. I mean movies like Jaws kind of villainize sharks, and obviously they are very powerful and very dangerous. But they are creatures that we share this planet with, and perhaps they’re just misunderstood.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nSo yeah, that’s my I’m an Optimist, but… I’m an optimist, but I’m sad that sharks are on the receiving end of such horrible treatment by humans, who are the apex predators of, like, every species?\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nSo yeah. But it was also very uplifting to watch this conservationist do what she does, which is…. crazy. It’s really impressive and I would not be putting myself in that position, but more power to her.\n\nKarissa:\n\nSeems like someone we might have to keep an eye on for the Optimist Daily, because seems like she’s really trying to make a difference for the sharks. Speaking of decline and extinction, it kind of brings me to my solution, but it’s something totally different. Something underground, actually.\n\nArielle:\n\nWow, I’m intrigued.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI’ll just start with the title, which is Underground library in Warsaw metro invites commuters to trade scrolling for stories. This one caught my eye because, as I’ve mentioned a lot recently on the pod, I’m really trying to put myself back in the reading game. And it’s just been a concern of mine how little people are reading and really spending too much time on our phones. But you know, of course I’m also guilty of that.\n\nArielle, you live in Europe, so I’m assuming you must know the dilemma of using public transit and having to pass the time as you wait for the arrival of the train or something. So, if you look around, I would guess, like here, everyone’s kind of looking down at their phones.\n\nArielle:\n\nI do have to say that I usually bike around. I’ve been trying to avoid public transit lately. I only take it if I really, really need it. But that’s also because here in the Netherlands, the system is pretty good. But there are also a lot of strikes, and that means that there’s a lot of waiting around for trains if you are in the station. And yeah, people are often, you know, flicking through their phone.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nDefinitely not as many people reading as there used to be.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, or even connecting with each other, I would assume, too.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI think that’s just common, not even just in public transit, but even just waiting in some kind of line for something or…\n\nArielle:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nKarissa:\n\nMindless scrolling is definitely an issue, globally. And so, in an effort to combat mindless scrolling in Warsaw’s Targówek district, a metro ride has become more than a daily routine. Now it offers a chance to escape into a story through books and connection. Thanks to Metroteka, newly opened subterranean library inside a metro station, commuters can now trade mindless scrolling for mindful reading.\n\nArielle:\n\nI love this image. So how does it all work?\n\nKarissa:\n\nWell, the 150 -square-meter space is stocked with more than 16,000 books, all available through a fast self -checkout system. Books can be returned either directly to the library or via parcel lockers outside the station, available around the clock. Additionally, visitors can also borrow laptops, sip complimentary coffee, and unwind at a cozy communal area, all while waiting for their train.\n\nArielle:\n\nI can’t even really imagine what a library would look like in a metro station. Can you kind of paint the picture for me?\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. So, it’s a modern and inviting space that breathes life into the books. There’s a lush hydroponic garden wall filled with herbs and flowers that gives the underground space a breath of fresh air. Literally, because they’re plants. Basil, oregano, and other plants grow without soil or sunlight, infusing the library with an unexpected sense of vitality, since it is underground. The bookshelves shaped like soft undulating waves add to the organic feel.\n\nArielle:\n\nThis sounds so cool. I love the greenery within an underground space, and it sounds like a place I would visit even if I weren’t waiting for a train.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThis is all part of a bigger goal to reverse a national trend in Poland because Poland’s reading habits have been in steady decline for years, much like I’m sure the rest of the world. A 2024 survey by the National Library of Poland found that only 41% of respondents had read at least one book in the past year. I mean, even though this is a global trend of people turning to their phones instead of books, it is kind of unique to Poland’s history, according to Tomasz Makowski, director of the National Library. The legacy of war has shaped these numbers. During World War II, Poland lost 70% of its libraries.\n\nArielle:\n\nHmm.\n\nKarissa:\n\nMakowski says “We had several generations that did not see their parents or grandparents in front of a wall of books.”\n\nArielle:\n\nWow, that’s… that’s crazy. I’m actually kind of learning about this. I am part of a book club, and we’re reading a book called Swimming in the Dark by a Polish writer, Tomasz Jedrowski. I’m so sorry for my pronunciation, if any Polish readers are like, cringing. But yeah, I didn’t know that this was happening in Poland. I’m really not familiar with that history at all, but it is a bit heartbreaking to think that people didn’t have the experience of just access to books because of war.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. And here in Poland, Makowski also says that reading is also not something associated with adulthood, but with schools, teachers, librarians, and usually mothers reading to children. So, it’s kind of an interesting cultural phenomenon. By placing literature in the path of everyday commuters, Metroteka hopes to shift that cultural perception.\n\nArielle:\n\nI really love this idea of an open invitation into the world of books, and putting a library in a commuting hub just makes sense.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI think it totally does. And for Makowski, the location and its potential are just as important as the books. He says, “Opening a library in a metro station is like a dream for us. Libraries should be beautiful and open, inviting, not intimidating. It’s not a shrine, but a place where you can go spend time freely, take part in discussions, public consultations, or meet people.”\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah. And the metro station kind of sounds like a perfect spot for that, with all the people coming and going. It sounds like a great place for connection and convenience.\n\nKarissa:\n\nAbsolutely. And so, in the coming months, Metroteka plans to host author readings, workshops, and classes to further engage the community and really build this. But by meeting people where they are–literally underground–the library isn’t just promoting reading; it’s redefining what public space can offer. It’s not just a library. It’s not just about the books, even though that’s an important part of it, but really a place to connect with other people.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, exactly. As we all know, that loneliness epidemic is rampant. Amazing solution. Thank you so much for sharing it. On the topic of connection, I think that flows nicely into my solution.\n\nKarissa:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nArielle:\n\nAs usual, I’m going to start with a couple of questions for you, Karissa.\n\nKarissa:\n\nArielle:\n\nHave you had or do you have a best friend at the moment?\n\nKarissa:\n\nI honestly feel like I have a lot of people I consider my best friends, and I’ve definitely developed new best friends over the years, like in college. And yeah, even though a lot of my so-called best friends are pretty spread out now, we still have such a deep connection.\n\nArielle:\n\nBut not just one, not just like one certain person who is top of the top, best of the best.\n\nKarissa:\n\nNot really. I do have… Well, OK, I have to shout out my best friend Taryn because she is someone I do feel like I… I think, like, we have, like, the strongest bond that’s maintained over the years, and we’ve really made so much effort to get together the most and stuff, but not in a bad way. We’re not so attached to the hip that, you know, we can’t, like, do anything else. So yes and no, I think my final answer is I have multiple, but Taryn is my best friend.\n\nArielle:\n\nOK, that sounds pretty healthy. I, myself, I think I’ve had people call me their best friend, and no shade, but I don’t think I’ve ever actually considered someone a best best friend because I’ve had such separate social circles. Like growing up, I went to church, and then there’s school, and then there’s like…\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nFamily friends and things like that. So, there were a couple people who I would consider my best friend in that context, but…\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nI never really had one best friend. And this question, “Who’s your best friend?” has followed many of us around since grade school, which kind of lets us know at a very young age that our social worth, at least in part, is hinged on whether you had one, like, ride or die friend.\n\nKarissa:\n\nRight.\n\nArielle:\n\nPop culture doesn’t help either; we’re told friendships should look like Christina and Meredith from Grey’s Anatomy or Blair and Serena from Gossip Girl, which, to be fair, was pretty toxic.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. That’s so funny because one year for Halloween, my best friend and I were Blair and Serena for our Halloween costume. But I mean, the idea that you need that one all -in-forever partner in crime is pretty prominent.\n\nArielle:\n\nExactly. But here’s the thing. What if you don’t have that kind of friendship? Does that mean there’s something wrong with you? Not according to my solution, which is titled Rethinking the best friend ideal: why you don’t need a BFF to feel fulfilled.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, that sounds interesting. I’m curious to hear more.\n\nArielle:\n\nDoctor Christina Ferrari, a clinical psychologist in Miami, points out that the best friend label often feels like proof that you’re loved and secure. If someone calls you their best, it’s like you’ve won the friendship lottery. but Ferrari emphasizes that not having that singular BFF is not a failure. In fact, it’s more realistic and healthier.\n\nKarissa:\n\nThat’s kind of refreshing to hear because, honestly, maintaining such an all-encompassing, ocean-deep-level bond With anyone sounds pretty exhausting.\n\nArielle:\n\nBarbie Atkinson, a counselor based in Houston, says the BFF trope is a lovely fantasy, but it really clashes with the reality of adult life. To pull it off, you’d need unlimited free time, perfectly aligned life stages, and zero interference from kids, partners, jobs, all the messy, wonderful stuff that comes with adulthood.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, exactly. That makes so much sense because, like, I kind of said with my BFF, we’ve been lucky because we’ve been friends since elementary school. But we did go to colleges pretty close by to each other, so we were able to see each other more often. But now that we’re both out of college, we’re both further than we were in college. It’s so hard to see her, or like any of my other best friends I mentioned, a lot of us are in geographically different places. And of course, like you mentioned, different life stages as well.\n\nArielle:\n\nMm-hm.\n\nKarissa:\n\nBasically, unless you live in a sitcom, it’s not gonna happen that you’re with someone like that so often.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, precisely. And even if it were possible, experts caution that putting all your emotional eggs in one basket isn’t healthy. Ferrari compares it to investing. If you wouldn’t put all your money in one stock, why would you put all your emotional needs in one person.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, I think that’s such a good point. And that also reminds you of romantic partnerships as well. I just really don’t like the idea of putting all your emotional needs in, like, just your romantic partner. When I’ve seen people doing that and stuff, I get really concerned. And I try my best not to do that either with my partner.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah.\n\nKarissa:\n\nBut I guess, what’s the alternative?\n\nArielle:\n\nSo, Atkinson suggests thinking of your friendships like a circle of support rather than a single pillar. And here’s where it gets interesting. Each friend can bring out a different strength.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI love that.\n\nArielle:\n\nI guess this is kind of how I’ve been viewing friendships without having all this language around it. She says that you can find friends who play all of these different roles that I’m about to lay out for you. So first, there’s the emotional anchor. This is the friend you can trust with your most vulnerable moments. They’re the one you call when you’re heartbroken or when family drama gets overwhelming. And they may not have all the answers, but their gift is listening and helping you feel seen.\n\nKarissa:\n\nNice.\n\nArielle:\n\nThere’s also the practical problem solver. This is the person you text when you’re stressing over whether to take a new job or how to plan a two-week trip somewhere. They’re level-headed, logical and great at mapping out options you might not have even considered.\n\nKarissa:\n\nSo this is kind of like a human version of a pros and cons list.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah. Then there’s the playmate who fills a completely different need. They’re spontaneous. Maybe they’re the person who drags you out dancing on a weeknight. Or convinces you to book that last-minute road trip. They bring lightness and fun and spontaneity, and that’s just as essential as deep conversations.\n\nKarissa:\n\nI feel like we kind of underestimate how important that type of friend is. Sometimes joy is the medicine you need, and sometimes you need that friend to give you that extra push.\n\nArielle:\n\nAnd then you’ve got the contextual companion. The friends you don’t necessarily call every day, but who do make certain parts of life better. So maybe it’s someone you go running with who keeps you accountable or… yeah, I have like, book club friends who I don’t talk to throughout the month, but I always have great discussions with them when we’re together. These connections might not feel all-encompassing, but they do add a lot of richness to daily life.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. And instead of one person carrying the weight of being everything, you end up with this tapestry of friendships, each adding a unique thread.\n\nArielle:\n\nThat tapestry can be just as fulfilling, if not more, than having the mythical best friend we’ve all been told we should have.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, absolutely. It makes friendship feel less about scarcity. Like, you’re missing out if you don’t have one BFF, and more about abundance.\n\nArielle:\n\nYou don’t need a crowned to BFF to feel loved and supported; what matters is building a circle where every connection, big or small, adds to your sense of belonging.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, I just love this so much. Like I’m about to shed a tear because I’m thinking about my great friends who I see in a lot of these different pillars you discussed, Arielle. So, shout out to all my friends. They make the tapestry of life so much better.\n\nArielle:\n\nIt’s really fun to have a support system of varied and diverse people. Because life throws all of these varied and diverse curveballs. So that was my solution of the week!\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah. Love it. And I loved all the other solutions we had on the Optimist Daily this week too.\n\nArielle:\n\nYes, they include All aboard the clean power express: Colorado startup turns trains into rolling batteries. Senegal’s “schools for husbands” are saving mothers’ lives by reshaping masculinity. How to plan a realistic digital detox the whole family will enjoy, and Hope in Cape Cod: rescuers save 12 dolphins in two-day stranding response.\n\nKarissa:\n\nNow we also had 6 sneaky habits that are secretly sabotaging your joints (and how to fix them). AI tool speeds up stroke care across England, tripling recovery rates, New brain stimulation helmet could transform treatment for Parkinson’s and depression. And How to shine as potluck guest, according to a hosting pro.\n\nArielle:\n\nPro perfect. Great for all of. Those autumn and Thanksgiving gatherings that are probably going to start happening soon.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, and mingling with those different friends of your life.\n\nArielle:\n\nYeah, exactly. And maybe you can trade book recommendations as well.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah.\n\nArielle:\n\nAll right, that is all from us this week. Karissa, I wish you a very happy weekend and the same to all of our listeners and fellow Optimists.\n\nKarissa:\n\nYeah, me too. And I can’t wait to be back next week with more solutions! Until then.\n\nBoth:\n\nBye!",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In many places, fewer people are reading books and more are spending time on their phones. In Poland, this is especially true because World War II destroyed most of the country’s libraries. At the same time, many people feel pressure to have one “best friend,” which can be stressful and lonely.\n\n**What happened** – Warsaw opened a new underground library inside a busy metro station. This library, called Metroteka, offers over 16,000 books for commuters to borrow easily, along with a cozy space to relax and even free coffee. It aims to encourage people to read and connect instead of scrolling on their phones. Meanwhile, experts shared new ideas about friendship, explaining that you don’t need just one best friend to feel happy. Instead, having different friends who support you in different ways can be healthier and more realistic.\n\n**Impact** – The underground library is a unique way to bring books back into daily life and fight loneliness by turning a busy metro station into a welcoming place for reading and meeting others. It challenges the idea that libraries have to be quiet and distant, making them lively and inviting. The friendship advice helps people understand that it’s normal to have many meaningful friendships, each serving a different role, which can reduce stress and build stronger communities.\n\n**What's next step** – Metroteka plans to hold author readings, workshops, and classes to further involve the community. The new friendship ideas may encourage people to appreciate all their relationships and feel more connected even if they don’t have a single “best friend.” Both efforts show practical ways to create belonging and support in everyday life.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Warsaw’s underground library and fresh views on friendship offer simple but powerful ways to bring people together and make daily life richer and more connected.",

En Pologne, cela est particulièrement vrai car la Seconde Guerre mondiale a détruit la plupart des bibliothèques du pays. En même temps, beaucoup ressentent la pression d’avoir un « meilleur ami », ce qui peut être stressant et isolant.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Varsovie a ouvert une nouvelle bibliothèque souterraine dans une station de métro très fréquentée. Cette bibliothèque, appelée Metroteka, propose plus de 16 000 livres que les voyageurs peuvent emprunter facilement, avec un espace confortable pour se détendre et même du café gratuit. Elle vise à encourager la lecture et les échanges plutôt que le défilement sur les téléphones. Parallèlement, des experts ont partagé de nouvelles idées sur l’amitié, expliquant qu’il n’est pas nécessaire d’avoir un seul meilleur ami pour être heureux. Avoir plusieurs amis qui vous soutiennent de différentes façons est souvent plus sain et réaliste.\n\n**Impact** – La bibliothèque souterraine est une manière originale de réintroduire les livres dans la vie quotidienne et de lutter contre la solitude en transformant une station de métro en un lieu accueillant pour la lecture et les rencontres. Elle remet en cause l’idée que les bibliothèques doivent être silencieuses et distantes, les rendant vivantes et invitantes. Les conseils sur l’amitié aident les gens à comprendre qu’il est normal d’avoir plusieurs amitiés importantes, chacune jouant un rôle différent, ce qui réduit le stress et renforce les communautés.\n\n**Prochaines étapes** – Metroteka prévoit d’organiser des lectures d’auteurs, des ateliers et des cours pour impliquer davantage la communauté. Les nouvelles idées sur l’amitié peuvent encourager les gens à apprécier toutes leurs relations et à se sentir plus connectés même sans un seul « meilleur ami ». Ces deux initiatives montrent des moyens concrets de créer du lien et du soutien dans la vie quotidienne.\n\n**Phrase clé** – La bibliothèque souterraine de Varsovie et une nouvelle vision de l’amitié offrent des moyens simples mais puissants de rapprocher les gens et d’enrichir la vie quotidienne.",

      "content": "Authors whose work has been retracted often build larger networks than do those without retractions, a study found.Credit: Halfpoint/iStock via Getty\n\nRetractions can have profound effects on researchers’ careers, sometimes in unexpected ways, a study that tracked the career trajectories of thousands of authors has found.\n\nThe range of experiences that authors go through raises questions about whether this mechanism — an important part of the scientific process — is working as intended, says co-author Shahan Ali Memon, an information scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\n“Retractions serve a crucial role in maintaining the credibility of scientific evidence, but their impact extends far beyond ‘correcting the record’,” says Memon. “Understanding these dynamics is important to evaluate, as a community, whether current processes serve their intended purpose — or if they come with unintended repercussions for the individuals involved.”\n\nMemon and his colleagues examined 4,578 papers, involving just under 15,000 authors, that were retracted between 1990 and 2015. The results, published in Nature Human Behaviour in April, showed that “around 45.9% of authors left their publishing careers around the time of retraction”.\n\nThe study found that early-career researchers were more likely than others to stop publishing after a retraction, as were authors whose papers were pulled for misconduct or plagiarism, and those whose retracted works attracted attention online.\n\nResearchers who continued publishing after a retraction tended to build larger networks than did those without retractions, the study found. They generally retain “less senior and less productive co-authors, but gain more impactful co-authors post-retraction”, Memon and his colleagues state. In this case, research impact was determined by how many citations the co-author attracted.\n\nFurther analysis is needed to determine why this happens, but Memon is urging publishers and institutions to not treat retracted authors as a homogeneous group, and to instead look at individual cases and give support when needed.\n\nThe retraction experience\n\nRetractions can occur for several reasons, only one of which is misconduct, such as fraud or plagiarism. Other culprits are honest mistakes or a lack of reproducibility. Another is the fact that complex research can sometimes yield unintended errors that cannot always be easily or definitively corrected. In such cases, retraction followed by rigorous revision and republication is an option, as was the case in 2019 when Nature accepted a formerly retracted paper.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\n“Context matters,” says Memon. “Institutions should carefully consider the circumstances behind each retraction.”\n\nMemon’s study was inspired by the first-hand experience of his co-authors, Bedoor AlShebli and Kinga Makovi at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, whose 2020 Nature Communications paper was retracted. AlShebli and Makovi’s study suggested that female scientists fare better when mentored by men, rather than by women. It was retracted following criticism from readers and an investigation by the journal. (Nature Index and Nature Communications are both published by Springer Nature; they are editorially independent of each other and their publisher.)",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – When scientific papers have serious problems, they are sometimes retracted, meaning they are officially withdrawn. Retractions help keep science accurate but can also change the careers of the researchers involved.\n\n**What happened** – A new study looked at nearly 4,600 retracted papers and almost 15,000 authors from 1990 to 2015. It found that about 46% of authors stopped publishing around the time their papers were retracted. Early-career researchers, those involved in misconduct, and those whose retractions gained public attention were most likely to quit. However, authors who kept publishing after retraction often built bigger and more influential research networks.\n\n**Impact** – This study shows that retractions do more than just correct mistakes; they affect people’s careers in different ways. Some researchers leave science, while others grow their connections and work with more influential colleagues. It also highlights that not all retractions are due to wrongdoing—some are honest errors or complex issues. Understanding these differences can help institutions treat each case fairly and provide support when needed.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers suggest that universities and publishers should look carefully at why a paper was retracted before deciding how to respond. They recommend offering help to researchers who face retractions, rather than treating all cases the same. More studies are needed to understand why some authors succeed after retraction and how best to support those who struggle.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Retractions affect scientists differently, and understanding these effects can help create fairer and more supportive responses in the research community.",
