      "summary": "A Stanford-led team has replaced toxic pre-transplant chemotherapy with a targeted antibody, allowing children with Fanconi anemia to receive stem cell transplants safely. The antibody, briquilimab, removes diseased stem cells without radiation, enabling nearly complete donor cell replacement. The approach also widens donor eligibility and could soon be applied to other bone marrow failure diseases.",
      "content": "A new antibody therapy developed at Stanford Medicine has shown that it can prepare patients for stem cell transplants without the need for toxic chemotherapy or radiation, according to results from a phase 1 clinical trial.\n\nThe study focused on patients with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder that makes traditional stem cell transplants extremely dangerous. Researchers believe the same method could also be used for people with other inherited diseases that require transplants.\n\n\"We were able to treat these really fragile patients with a new, innovative regimen that allowed us to reduce the toxicity of the stem cell transplant protocol,\" said Agnieszka Czechowicz, MD, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics and co-senior author of the study. \"Specifically, we could eliminate the use of radiation and genotoxic chemotherapy called busulfan, with exceptional outcomes.\"\n\nThe trial, published in Nature Medicine, used an antibody in combination with other drugs to enable successful transplants for three children with Fanconi anemia. All three patients have now been followed for two years and are doing well.\n\n\"If they don't get a transplant in time, Fanconi anemia patients' bodies eventually will not make blood, so they die of bleeding or infections,\" explained Rajni Agarwal, MD, professor of pediatric stem cell transplantation and co-first author. \"The reason I am so excited about this trial is that it is a novel approach to help these patients, who are very vulnerable.\"\n\nAntibody Replaces Radiation and Chemotherapy\n\nBefore a stem cell transplant (in which unhealthy bone marrow is replaced with a healthy donor's), doctors must eliminate the patient's own blood-forming stem cells. Normally, this involves radiation or chemotherapy. In this study, however, patients received antibodies targeting CD117, a protein found on blood-forming stem cells.\n\nThe antibody, known as briquilimab, safely removed those cells without the damaging side effects of traditional conditioning treatments.\n\nThis new success builds on decades of Stanford Medicine research aimed at making stem cell transplants safer and more widely available.\n\nCzechowicz began studying blood-forming stem cells in 2004 as an undergraduate working with Irving Weissman, MD, then director of Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. Their early studies showed that blocking CD117 with antibodies could eliminate stem cells in mice without using radiation or chemotherapy. Working with other Stanford scientists, they later identified a version suitable for human clinical use, leading to this recent trial.\n\nSolving the Donor Match Problem\n\nThe clinical trial also tackled another major hurdle in stem cell transplants: the shortage of fully matched donors. In the past, up to 40% of patients couldn't receive transplants because no compatible donor could be found.\n\nTo make the procedure more flexible, researchers modified donor bone marrow before transplantation. They enriched it for CD34+ cells (the donor's blood-forming stem cells) while removing immune cells called alpha/beta T-cells, which can cause a dangerous complication known as graft-versus-host disease. This method, pioneered by Alice Bertaina, MD, PhD, allows safe transplants from half-matched donors, including parents.\n\n\"We are expanding the donors for stem cell transplantation in a major way, so every patient who needs a transplant can get one,\" Agarwal said.\n\nA Child's Recovery: Ryder's Story\n\nThe first patient to receive the treatment was Ryder Baker, an 11-year-old from Seguin, Texas. He underwent the transplant at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in early 2022.\n\nToday, Ryder is thriving. \"He was so tired, he didn't have stamina. It's completely different now,\" said his mother, Andrea Reiley. She added that her son's Fanconi anemia \"doesn't slow him down like it used to.\"\n\nNow full of energy, Ryder recently finished fifth grade, plays sports, and even received an \"Up and Coming Player\" award from his school soccer team.\n\nHope for More Patients\n\nResearchers hope Ryder will be the first of many children to benefit. \"Bone marrow or stem cell transplants are most commonly used in blood cancers, in which the bone marrow is full of malignant cells and patients have no other options,\" said Czechowicz. \"But as we're making these transplants better and safer, we can expand them to more patients including those with many different diseases.\"\n\nUnderstanding Fanconi Anemia\n\nFanconi anemia affects the body's ability to repair DNA damage, disrupting the production of vital blood cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Children with the condition often experience fatigue, poor growth, frequent infections, and excessive bruising or bleeding.\n\nBy age 12, about 80% develop progressive bone marrow failure, which can be fatal if left untreated. The catch-22 is that while stem cell transplants can prevent this failure, the usual preparative chemotherapy or radiation can cause severe complications or even cancer.\n\n\"Right now, nearly all of these patients get secondary cancers by the time they're 40,\" Czechowicz said. The team hopes their new antibody-based approach will sharply lower that risk.\n\nPromising Results in Early Patients\n\nAll three trial participants were under 10 years old and had different genetic variants of Fanconi anemia. Each received one intravenous dose of the antibody 12 days before their transplant, followed by standard immune-suppressing medication but no busulfan or radiation.\n\nThe donated stem cells came from a parent and were carefully processed to remove harmful immune cells. Within two weeks, the new stem cells had taken root in the patients' bone marrow. None experienced graft rejection, and by one month after transplant, donor cells had nearly fully replaced their own.\n\nThe research team had initially aimed for just 1% donor cell presence. Two years later, all three children reached nearly 100% donor cell chimerism.\n\n\"We've been surprised by how well it's worked,\" Czechowicz said. \"We were optimistic that we would get here, but you never know when you're trying a new regimen.\"\n\nLife After Transplant\n\nEven with the safer protocol, transplants remain demanding. Ryder spent over a month in the hospital and experienced temporary exhaustion, nausea, and hair loss.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see him go through things like that -- I'd rather go through it than my child,\" Reiley said. \"I felt the heartbreak for him, and now he doesn't have to.\"\n\nSince recovery, Ryder has grown taller, gained weight, and is no longer constantly sick. \"It used to be huge hits when he would get sick at all, and I really don't have to worry about that anymore,\" Reiley said.\n\nShe also tells her son that his experience as one of the first patients will help others. \"I think he takes a lot of pride in that, too,\" she said.\n\nNext Steps for Stanford's Research\n\nAfter more than 30 years of using traditional methods, Agarwal said she's thrilled to offer families this new, less toxic option. \"When I counsel families, their eyes start to shine as they think, 'OK, we can avoid the radiation and chemo toxicity',\" she said.\n\nStanford's team is now leading a phase 2 clinical trial in more children with Fanconi anemia. They also plan to explore whether the antibody approach could help patients with other rare bone marrow failure disorders such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia.\n\nWhile most cancer patients will still need some chemotherapy or radiation to eliminate cancer cells, researchers are also studying whether the antibody can benefit elderly cancer patients who can't tolerate traditional conditioning.\n\n\"That population is often at a disadvantage,\" Agarwal said. \"It may provide us with a way to treat them with less intensity so it's possible for them to get a transplant.\"\n\nThe team is also developing next-generation antibody-based treatments to further refine and improve outcomes for Fanconi anemia and similar diseases.\n\nCollaboration and Support\n\nIn addition to Czechowicz, Agarwal, and Bertaina, co-senior author Matthew Porteus, MD, PhD, and researchers from the University of California, San Francisco; Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine; St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; and Jasper Therapeutics Inc. contributed to the study.\n\nThe research received funding from anonymous donors, the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, and the Fanconi Cancer Foundation. Jasper Therapeutics provided the antibody briquilimab, and the Stanford Clinical Trial Program supported the study's implementation.",

Usually, children with this illness need stem cell transplants to survive, but the treatments before the transplant, like chemotherapy and radiation, are very harmful and risky.\n\n**What happened**\nA team at Stanford found a new way to prepare children for stem cell transplants without using chemotherapy or radiation. Instead, they used an antibody called briquilimab to remove the sick stem cells safely. This method was tested on three children with Fanconi anemia, who received stem cells from their parents.

Ils ont utilisé un anticorps appelé briquilimab pour éliminer en toute sécurité les cellules souches malades. Cette méthode a été testée sur trois enfants atteints d’anémie de Fanconi, qui ont reçu des cellules souches de leurs parents. Deux ans après le traitement, les trois enfants sont en bonne santé et leurs corps ont presque complètement remplacé les anciennes cellules par celles du donneur.\n\n**Impact**\nCette méthode est importante car elle rend les greffes de cellules souches beaucoup plus sûres en évitant des traitements lourds qui peuvent causer de graves effets secondaires ou même un cancer plus tard. Elle permet aussi d’utiliser des donneurs à moitié compatibles, comme les parents, ce qui signifie que plus d’enfants peuvent recevoir la greffe dont ils ont besoin.

When this system breaks down, aging speeds up. By reactivating it, scientists were able to help cells recover their youthful behavior. The discovery opens exciting possibilities for anti-aging treatments.",
      "content": "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder that causes children to show signs of accelerated aging. Those affected often develop early skin wrinkling, loss of skin elasticity, reduced body fat, hair loss, hardened arteries, and insulin resistance. Scientists have found that about 90% of HGPS cases result from a defective protein known as progerin.\n\nProgerin has a harmful \"dominant-negative\" effect on cells, meaning it interferes with normal cell function. This abnormal protein triggers multiple cellular problems, such as deformation of the nuclear envelope (NE), increased DNA damage, shortened telomeres, cell cycle arrest, and reduced ability to divide. Interestingly, growing evidence suggests that small amounts of progerin are also present during natural aging and in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Because of this, therapies that enhance the removal of progerin could hold promise for treating HGPS, CKD, and other conditions linked to aging.\n\nInvestigating How Cells Manage Progerin\n\nA research team led by Professor Chuanmao Zhang from Peking University and Kunming University of Science and Technology has long been focused on uncovering the biological mechanisms behind aging and progeria. In a recent study published in Science China Life Sciences, the group identified a key process in which lysosomes -- tiny cellular compartments responsible for breaking down waste -- play a central role in clearing progerin.\n\nTheir study revealed that defects in lysosomes contribute to the accumulation of progerin in HGPS cells. More importantly, they demonstrated that stimulating lysosome activity can restore this cellular \"cleanup\" function, helping remove progerin and reducing signs of cell aging. These discoveries highlight lysosomes as an important new target for potential therapies in HGPS, CKD, and other age-related diseases.\n\nHow Progerin Builds Up Inside Cells\n\nUsing a combination of immunofluorescence imaging, live-cell observation, and biochemical analysis, the researchers tracked how progerin behaves inside cells. They observed that progerin, which first appears near the nuclear envelope, can move into the cell's cytoplasm through a process called nuclear envelope budding. Once in the cytoplasm, progerin should normally be degraded through the cell's autophagy-lysosome pathway -- a key recycling system.\n\nHowever, in HGPS cells, this system fails to work efficiently, allowing progerin to accumulate. To investigate why, the team performed RNA sequencing on primary cells from two patients with HGPS. The results showed a significant reduction in the activity of genes linked to lysosome function. Further tests, including RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and biochemical assays, confirmed that lysosomes in these cells were indeed defective.\n\nRestoring Lysosome Function to Fight Cellular Aging\n\nNext, the researchers tested whether repairing the lysosomal defects could enhance progerin clearance and slow down cellular aging. They activated lysosome biogenesis -- the process by which new lysosomes are formed -- through two methods: by stimulating protein kinase C (PKC) or by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).\n\nBoth approaches successfully improved lysosome function, boosted the removal of progerin, and reduced signs of cellular aging, such as DNA damage, growth arrest, and loss of cell vitality. These findings suggest that reawakening the cell's own cleanup machinery could help reverse some of the harmful effects of progerin buildup.\n\nToward Anti-Aging Therapies Targeting Lysosomes\n\nThis research clearly establishes lysosomes as key players in removing progerin and maintaining cellular health. It also points to lysosome activation as a potential strategy for combating premature and natural aging. By targeting the body's built-in recycling systems, scientists may eventually find new ways to treat HGPS and a wide range of age-related diseases.",

      "summary": "An extract from a desert berry used in traditional Chinese medicine restored insulin function and stabilized metabolism in diabetic mice. The findings hint at a powerful natural alternative for holistic diabetes treatment.",
      "content": "In what could mark a major step forward for diabetes care, scientists have found extraordinary health benefits in a little-known desert plant. The fruit of Nitraria roborowskii Kom, long used in traditional medicine, showed strong potential to fight insulin resistance and restore healthy metabolism in diabetic mice. The plant extract not only helped stabilize blood sugar but also corrected several related issues, including abnormal fat metabolism and oxidative stress. These results were linked to the activation of a key cellular signaling system that regulates how the body processes glucose and energy. The discovery points to the possibility of safer, naturally derived treatments for one of the world's most widespread chronic diseases.\n\nThe number of people living with diabetes is expected to climb to 750 million by 2045. While modern drugs can control symptoms, many come with side effects and do not address the underlying causes of metabolic imbalance. This has led scientists to revisit nature's medicine cabinet in search of new therapeutic options. Among these is Nitraria roborowskii Kom, a tough shrub that thrives in the harsh deserts of western China. Its bright red fruits, sometimes known as \"desert cherries,\" have nourished and healed local communities for centuries. Only recently have researchers begun to uncover the biological mechanisms behind its traditional use, prompting systematic scientific investigations into its potential.\n\nBreakthrough Study Confirms Potent Diabetes-Fighting Properties\n\nA collaborative study between Qinghai University and the Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, published in the Chinese Journal of Modern Applied Pharmacy, provided strong experimental evidence of the fruit's effects. Using well-controlled trials, scientists tested a concentrated form of the extract (NRK-C) on diabetic mice over seven weeks. The results were striking: the compound not only lowered blood sugar and improved insulin responsiveness but also addressed broader metabolic dysfunctions through a previously underexplored biological route.\n\nHow the Desert Berry Restores Metabolic Balance\n\nThe detailed analysis revealed the extract's impressive range of benefits. Over the course of seven weeks, NRK-C reduced fasting blood glucose levels by 30-40% in diabetic mice, with stronger results at higher doses. It also improved insulin sensitivity by roughly 50% compared with untreated animals. In addition to these improvements, the extract balanced cholesterol and lowered oxidative stress markers by as much as 60%, a rare feat for any single therapeutic compound.\n\nFurther investigation showed that NRK-C works by reactivating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway -- a critical metabolic circuit that often breaks down in diabetes. This reactivation appears to \"reboot\" the body's ability to regulate glucose and fat metabolism. Microscopic examination supported these findings, revealing healthier liver and pancreatic tissue structures in treated mice compared with untreated ones. Taken together, these findings suggest the compound helps the body reset its metabolic function rather than just masking symptoms. Its naturally broad effects contrast sharply with the narrowly targeted mechanisms of many pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nExpert Insight: A Holistic Approach to Diabetes Treatment\n\n\"These results are exciting because they suggest we might be able to treat diabetes more holistically,\" said Dr. Yue Huilan, a senior researcher on the project. \"Instead of just lowering blood sugar like most medications, this plant extract appears to help the body regain its natural metabolic balance. The implications could extend beyond diabetes to other conditions involving insulin resistance.\" While the team emphasized that human trials are still needed, the findings represent an encouraging move toward more natural and comprehensive approaches to diabetes care.\n\nThis discovery opens up several promising research directions. Pharmaceutical developers may pursue standardized NRK-C extracts as supplements or adjunct therapies, while nutrition experts could explore adding the fruit to functional foods aimed at metabolic health. The results also lend modern scientific support to traditional medicinal knowledge, helping bridge ancient practice and contemporary medicine. Researchers are particularly eager to determine whether NRK-C could help prevent diabetes in high-risk individuals or reduce complications in those already affected.\n\nMore broadly, the findings underscore the value of preserving and studying traditional medicinal plants, many of which may hold untapped potential for addressing modern health challenges. Nature, it seems, still has many healing secrets waiting to be rediscovered.",

      "title": "The hidden “Big Bang” that decides how bowel cancer grows",
      "summary": "Scientists have pinpointed a “Big Bang” moment in bowel cancer—when cells first evade the immune system. This early immune escape locks in how the cancer will behave as it grows. The discovery could help predict which patients respond to immunotherapy and lead to new vaccine strategies",
      "content": "Just as the universe began with a colossal explosion, bowel cancer also experiences a \"Big Bang\" moment that determines how it will grow and spread, according to new research supported by Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust.\n\nScientists from The Institute of Cancer Research in London, the Fondazione Human Technopole in Milan, and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden discovered that this pivotal event occurs when cancer cells first manage to hide from the immune system. This process, called immune escape, allows the cells to evade detection and continue developing unchecked.\n\nDuring immune escape, bowel cancer cells disrupt the genes that normally allow the body's immune defenses to recognize them as a threat. Once this happens, the researchers found that the cancer's ability to disguise itself remains largely unchanged as it grows.\n\nThe findings could help doctors identify patients more likely to respond to immunotherapy, including experimental bowel cancer vaccines that train the immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.\n\nHow Bowel Cancer Outsmarts the Immune System\n\nProfessor Trevor Graham, Professor of Genomics and Evolution and Director of the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at The Institute of Cancer Research, explained the significance of the discovery:\n\n\"Some bowel cancers are 'born to be bad.' How they interact with the immune system is set early on.\n\n\"Immunotherapy and bowel cancer vaccines hold enormous promise for treating the disease. Our research suggests that a bowel cancer's relationship with the immune system doesn't change very much as it grows. If we can target that relationship early on, treatment should have a stronger chance of success.\n\n\"As bowel cancer treatment becomes increasingly personalized, understanding how tumors evolve and change matters even more than it did before. Like the explosion which set the course of the universe, bowel cancer's Big Bang gives us the biggest clues of what its future holds and how we might change that future.\"\n\nA Common and Challenging Cancer\n\nBowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with about 44,100 new cases each year -- around 120 every day. Approximately 15% of these cases respond well to immunotherapy, while the majority remain resistant to this treatment approach.\n\nCurrently, several types of bowel cancer vaccines are being tested in clinical trials. These are designed to help the immune system recognize and destroy returning or newly forming cancer cells after surgery or other treatments.\n\nStudy lead author Eszter Lakatos, a mathematical biologist at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, said:\n\n\"Our research group has investigated and found answers to how cancer cells render themselves invisible to the immune system. Our hope is that these insights will eventually lead to more targeted, effective and early treatments, in addition to surgery.\"\n\nTo uncover these mechanisms, the research team analyzed tumor and immune cells from 29 people with bowel cancer. They sequenced the DNA and RNA from each sample and examined how tightly the DNA was wound around proteins in the chromosomes (a process known as epigenetics).\n\nThe scientists found that epigenetic changes in cancer cells alter how DNA is \"read\" to produce RNA, which carries the instructions for making proteins. These changes can reduce the number of neoantigens -- \"red flag\" proteins that alert immune cells to danger -- on the surface of cancer cells. With fewer neoantigens, the immune system struggles to recognize and destroy the tumor.\n\nToward More Effective Immunotherapy\n\nThe researchers believe that combining immunotherapy with drugs that modify the epigenome could improve treatment outcomes. Such a combination might increase the number of neoantigens displayed by cancer cells, making them easier for the immune system to target. Further testing will be needed before this approach can move into clinical trials.\n\nDr. Catherine Elliott, Director of Research at Cancer Research UK, said:\n\n\"To beat bowel cancer for everyone, we need to understand what happens at the very earliest stages of the disease. No matter how different bowel cancer tumors can look, one defining moment at the start makes a big difference to how the cancer grows.\n\n\"Bowel cancer has an insidious ability to resist treatment. Immunotherapy is starting to work well for patients, but it doesn't work for everyone. This research helps us understand why, as well as giving us new insights to make immunotherapy work better for bowel cancer.\"\n\nUnderstanding the Disease's Earliest Moments\n\nTom Collins, Research Lead for Discovery Research at the Wellcome Trust, added:\n\n\"Through tracing the earliest stages of bowel cancer, the research team has shed valuable new light on a mechanism that could lead to more targeted, effective and early treatments.\n\n\"This is a powerful example of discovery science. Research at this molecular level has provided a deeper understanding of how bowel cancer develops, which could lead to the improved health outcomes for patients in the long-term.\"\n\nThe study, titled \"Epigenetically driven and early immune evasion in colorectal cancer evolution,\" was published on November 5 in Nature Genetics.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Bowel cancer is a common disease, affecting tens of thousands of people each year in the UK. While some treatments work well for certain patients, many do not respond to new medicines that help the immune system fight the cancer.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers from the UK, Italy, and Sweden discovered a crucial early event in bowel cancer development. They found that cancer cells manage to hide from the immune system very early on, a process called immune escape. This event sets the pattern for how the cancer will grow and resist treatment.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it explains why some bowel cancers are harder to treat with immunotherapy. By understanding when and how the cancer cells become invisible to the immune system, doctors may better predict which patients will respond to treatments. It also opens the door to new treatments, like vaccines that train the immune system to find and attack cancer cells.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to test combining immunotherapy with drugs that change how cancer cells show themselves to the immune system. They hope this will make treatments work better for more patients. Ongoing clinical trials of vaccines are also part of this effort to improve care.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Early hiding by bowel cancer cells from the immune system shapes how the disease grows and may guide better, more personalized treatments in the future.",
