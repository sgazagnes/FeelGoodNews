      "title": "Breakthrough lets scientists watch plants breathe in real time",
      "summary": "Scientists have created a new way to watch plants breathe—live and in high definition—while tracking exactly how much carbon and water they exchange with the air. The breakthrough could help unlock crops that grow smarter, stronger, and more drought-resistant.",
      "content": "Scientists have long understood that plants take in air through tiny openings on their leaves known as stomata. These microscopic pores act like adjustable valves, letting carbon dioxide enter the leaf for photosynthesis while allowing water vapor to escape into the air. Until now, closely tracking this balancing act as it happens has been extremely difficult.\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have now created a powerful new system that makes this possible. Their study, published in the journal Plant Physiology, introduces a tool called \"Stomata In-Sight.\" It overcomes a major obstacle in plant science by allowing scientists to observe the minute movements of stomata while also measuring, at the same time, how much gas the leaf is exchanging with the atmosphere under carefully controlled conditions.\n\nWhy Stomata Matter for Crops and Water Use\n\nStomata (Greek for \"mouths\") play a central role in agriculture worldwide. When these pores open, plants absorb the carbon they need to grow. But this process also leads to water loss. Because of this tradeoff, the number of stomata on a leaf and how they open and close directly affect how efficiently a plant uses water.\n\nUnderstanding this process is essential for developing crops that can grow with less water and still reliably produce food, biofuel and bioproducts, especially in regions facing drought. As the research team explained, \"Traditionally, we've had to choose between seeing the stomata or measuring their function.\"\n\nEarlier approaches often relied on taking leaf impressions (like taking a dental mold), which only show a frozen moment in time. Other methods used standard microscopes that could view the leaf but offered no control over the surrounding environment. This limitation matters because stomata respond quickly to changes in light, temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels.\n\nA Window Into the Living Leaf\n\nThe new \"Stomata In-Sight\" system brings together three advanced technologies in a single setup:\n\nLive Confocal Microscopy\n\nThis laser-based imaging method produces sharp, three-dimensional images of living plant cells without cutting into the tissue. Leaf Gas Exchange Measurement\n\nHighly sensitive instruments track exactly how much CO2 the leaf absorbs and how much water vapor it releases. Environmental Control\n\nA specialized chamber allows researchers to precisely adjust light, temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide to simulate real-world growing conditions.\n\nBy combining these tools, scientists can directly observe how stomata behave as environmental conditions change, providing a real-time view of plant responses that was not possible before.\n\nWhy This Breakthrough Matters\n\nThis detailed look at plant function could reshape how crops are bred. By pinpointing the physical and chemical signals that tell stomata when to open or close, and by understanding how stomatal density affects this behavior, researchers can identify genetic traits linked to \"smarter\" plants -- crops that use water most efficiently.\n\nThis is especially important because water availability is the single greatest environmental limit on agricultural production. Improving water-use efficiency could help crops withstand increasing heat and drought stress.\n\nThe system was developed by Joseph D. Crawford, Dustin Mayfield-Jones, Glenn A. Fried, Nicolas Hernandez and Andrew D.B. Leakey at the Department of Plant Biology and the Institute for Genomic Biology at the University of Illinois.\n\nAbout the Study\n\nThe research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation, the National Science Foundation and a philanthropic gift. The findings appear in an open-access paper titled, \"Stomata In-Sight: Integrating Live Confocal Microscopy with Leaf Gas Exchange and Environmental Control,\" published in Plant Physiology.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nTo wrap up our Best of 2025 series, we’re sharing something a little more personal… our Staff Picks! These are the articles that sparked extra chats, late-night musings, and genuine delight among our team. They made us think, smile, and (of course) feel a little more optimistic. We hope they do the same for you.\n\nIn a small Finnish town with a big climate goal, an unassuming tower of sand is quietly storing solar and wind energy all while making a powerful statement about clean tech innovation.\n\nPornainen, in southern Finland, is now home to the world’s largest sand battery: a 13-metre-high, 15-metre-wide thermal storage system built by Finnish company Polar Night Energy. Capable of holding 100 megawatt-hours (MWh) of heat, the new battery will slash emissions from the town’s district heating network by nearly 70 percent and phase out the use of oil.\n\n“Our goal is to be climate neutral by 2035, and the sand battery is a major step toward that,” says Mikko Paajanen, CEO of Loviisan Lämpö, which operates the heating system.\n\nWith its large-scale rollout, the battery is now the network’s main energy provider. Wood chip use is expected to drop by 60 percent, while an existing biomass boiler will offer backup during energy demand spikes.\n\nThe surprising power of sand\n\nThe Pornainen battery isn’t Finland’s first foray into sandy storage. In 2022, Polar Night Energy launched a smaller prototype in Kankaanpää, just as Russia cut off gas supplies. The timing made a strong case for homegrown, renewable energy solutions.\n\nEngineers and co-founders Markku Ylönen and Tommi Eronen came up with the idea in 2018. “We were talking about how—if we had the liberty to design a community for ourselves—how could we solve the energy problem?” said Markku. “Especially here in the north, you run into the problem of energy storage.”\n\nSand turned out to be the perfect candidate: affordable, abundant, and surprisingly spacious when it comes to storing heat.\n\nLithium batteries, while useful in certain situations, fall short for large-scale energy storage due to cost and environmental concerns. Sand, by contrast, can store heat for days or even months at a time.\n\nHow does a sand battery work?\n\nThe system is relatively straightforward. A tower is filled with low-grade sand and heated using excess electricity from solar or wind power. This is done via resistive heating, where friction from the electrical current generates heat. That hot air then flows through a heat exchanger, charging the sand.\n\nStored at around 500 degrees Celsius, the heat is held until needed. When temperatures drop, the battery releases the hot air to warm water in the town’s district heating system. In Kankaanpää, it helps heat homes, offices, and even the local swimming pool.\n\n“There’s really nothing fancy there,” Markku explains. “The complex part happens on the computer; we need to know how the heat moves inside the storage, so we know how much is available and at what rate we can discharge and charge.”\n\nWhat makes this one different?\n\nThe Pornainen system is about ten times larger than the Kankaanpää model. It’s built using crushed soapstone, a by-product from the Finnish fireplace company Tulikivi. As project manager Naskali notes, “The soapstone they use is a very Finnish thing.”\n\nAnd it’s not just nostalgic; it’s practical. Soapstone meets the density and heat tolerance needed to store thermal energy efficiently. “We always choose the storage medium based on the customer’s needs,” says Naskali. “Examining and testing different materials is crucial for us to use options that are cost-effective and support the circular economy.”\n\nMayor Antti Kuusela is a proud supporter. “This project has gone very smoothly,” he says. Town buildings like the school, library, and town hall all run on district heating. “Pornainen wants to be a front runner in sustainable energy solutions.”\n\nIn summer, the battery can meet nearly a month’s heating demand; in winter, about a week’s. Each year, it’s expected to eliminate 160 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.\n\nCan sand really save the world?\n\nWell, maybe not all sand. A Dutch study recently warned that demand for construction sand will surge by 45 percent in the next 40 years, with harmful impacts on rivers and lakes. But Polar Night Energy isn’t after beach sand.\n\n“We wanted to find something that can be sourced nearly everywhere in the world,” said Markku. Their solution is to use any sand-like material that meets thermodynamic standards. That flexibility keeps costs low and helps promote sustainable sourcing.\n\nWith successful pilots in Kankaanpää, Tampere, and now Pornainen, the company has big dreams. Earlier this year, it announced a pilot in Valkeakoski to explore converting thermal energy back into electricity. International expansion is also on the horizon.\n\n“We want to build a hundred times larger storages around the world as fast as possible,” Markku asserted.\n\nFrom backyard brainstorms to international headlines, Finland’s sand battery movement is proving that sometimes the simplest materials can offer the smartest solutions.\n\nDid this solution from 2025 stand out to you?

      "summary": "Vivid green blooms form, drift, and fade in Hartbeespoortdam reservoir over the course of a year.",
      "content": "To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video June 2022-July 2023\n\nOn clear days in Hartbeespoort, South Africa, satellite images often reveal a reservoir with shades of deep blue interrupted by drifting patches of vivid green. These shifting features indicate algae blooms, which can affect water quality, ecosystems, and nearby human communities.\n\nIn this animation, from June 2022 to July 2023, an algal bloom grows, moves around the reservoir, and then fades. The animation is composed of images from Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), a NASA product that combines imagery from the NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites and the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2A, 2B, and 2C satellites.\n\nAlgae is an umbrella term for photosynthetic organisms that live in water, encompassing everything from single-celled cyanobacteria to seaweed. They play a vital role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. But when colonies of algae spread too widely or release harmful toxins, they can threaten the very environments they support. These colonies are known as harmful algal blooms, or HABs.\n\nSome HABs are toxic and often are part of a process called eutrophication. Eutrophication begins when there are too many nutrients in an ecosystem—because of agricultural runoff and other inputs—leading to a rapid growth of algae.\n\n“It's like having a garden,” said Bridget Seegers, a NASA scientist who studies cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems. “If you add a lot of nutrients, you’re going to have a lot of growth.”\n\nEventually, the algae die off. As decomposers break down the dead algae, they consume oxygen, which can lead to hypoxia and the formation of dead zones.\n\nAugust 10, 2022\n\nSuch conditions have been documented at the Hartbeespoortdam (Hartbeespoort Dam) reservoir, located about 25 kilometers (16 miles) west of Pretoria and used primarily for recreation and irrigation. The reservoir is home to regular harmful algal blooms containing cyanobacteria. It also hosts large mats of invasive water hyacinths. While hyacinths do not produce toxins, they do contribute to eutrophication when they die and decompose.\n\nHarmful algal blooms can affect ecosystem health and human lives and livelihoods. In April 2023, South African authorities linked a large fish kill in Hartbeespoort to low oxygen levels caused by excessive algal growth. More broadly, HABs in drinking water reservoirs can reduce water availability and raise water treatment costs, while swimming in HAB-infested waters can cause rashes, and pets or livestock that drink it may fall ill or die.\n\nOne 2022 paper published in Remote Sensing examined algae in the reservoir from 1980 to 2020 using Landsat data. “This is a reservoir that has always been monitored heavily by the local department of water resources,” said Adam Ali, the lead author of the paper. The research used satellite data to provide a big-picture view of conditions across the entire reservoir over long time scales. Using 40 years of Landsat data, the researchers found that the biggest drivers of algal growth were total phosphorus content—a nutrient found in runoff—and water temperature, with blooms typically expanding in the warm summer months and subsiding in the winter.\n\nThey also identified key trends over space and time. Algal productivity was higher near Krokodilrivier (Crocodile River) inflows and in the western part of the reservoir due to golf course runoff and restricted water circulation, demonstrating how HABs are influenced by runoff and river inputs. Large blooms occurred between 1982 and 1986, when total phosphorus levels were high. A bioremediation program in the late 1980s succeeded in limiting algae growth, but after funding ended in the late 1990s, harmful algal blooms spiked again in the early 2000s.\n\nTo track algae from space, the researchers analyzed the water’s color by measuring different wavelengths of light. From this, they estimated the concentration of chlorophyll-a, a common pigment in algae, and used these values to approximate algae biomass over time. Although water samples remain necessary to confirm that a bloom is harmful, satellite data can help scientists understand the drivers of harmful algal blooms, especially in remote regions where regular ground monitoring is expensive and time intensive.\n\nNew and forthcoming NASA missions promise to advance space-based water quality monitoring. The next Landsat satellite is expected to measure wavelengths specifically designed to detect HABs. NASA’s PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) mission, launched in 2024, collects data in hundreds of precise wavelength bands in the visible spectrum, which can help scientists identify the type of algae that comprise a certain bloom—a key factor in determining toxicity. Given PACE’s spatial resolution, the data is most useful in coastal areas or larger inland water bodies. Ali is working with researchers at NASA Ames to integrate PACE into future studies.\n\nAnimation by Ross Walter/Landsat Science Office Support, using data from the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) product.

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Hartbeespoortdam es un embalse cerca de Pretoria, Sudáfrica, que se usa para recreación y riego. En los últimos años, ha sufrido crecimientos de algas dañinas, llamadas floraciones de algas, que pueden afectar la calidad del agua, la vida silvestre y a las personas cercanas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Entre junio de 2022 y julio de 2023, satélites tomaron imágenes que muestran cómo las algas verdes se forman, se mueven y desaparecen en el embalse. Los científicos usaron datos combinados de la NASA y satélites europeos, llamados Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), para seguir estos cambios.\n\n**Impacto** – Este monitoreo ayuda a los científicos a entender cuándo y dónde crecen las algas dañinas, lo que es importante porque demasiadas algas pueden reducir el oxígeno en el agua, matar peces y hacer que el agua no sea segura para nadar o beber. Investigaciones anteriores con 40 años de datos satelitales mostraron que el crecimiento de algas está relacionado con nutrientes del agua de escorrentía y temperaturas más cálidas. Los esfuerzos en los años 80 ayudaron a reducir las algas, pero las floraciones aumentaron cuando terminó el financiamiento. Nuevas misiones satelitales, como la misión PACE de la NASA lanzada en 2024, brindarán información más detallada sobre tipos de algas y toxicidad.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores usarán mejores herramientas satelitales para observar las algas con más detalle. Esto ayudará a las autoridades locales a manejar mejor la calidad del agua y proteger los ecosistemas y comunidades. Combinar datos satelitales con pruebas de agua en tierra dará una imagen más clara de las floraciones dañinas y apoyará los esfuerzos para reducir la contaminación.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Satélites avanzados están ayudando a los científicos a rastrear y entender las algas dañinas en el embalse Hartbeespoortdam de Sudáfrica, mejorando la protección del agua y la vida silvestre.\n",

      "content": "Egg crate mattress pads, memory foam toppers, and other foam bedding shouldn’t go in your curbside recycling bin. However, you still have other options besides sending them to a landfill. With a little effort, you can find ways to reuse these materials or make sure they’re recycled correctly.\n\nMost foam mattress pads are made from polyurethane foam, a synthetic material that most city recycling programs can’t handle. According to the American Chemistry Council, U.S. manufacturers make 300 million pounds of polyurethane foam each year just for mattresses, and toppers add even more.\n\nThe main challenge with recycling foam is cost and logistics. Foam can be shredded and reused for things like carpet padding or car seats, but breaking it down takes a lot of work, so making new foam is usually cheaper. Unlike metal springs in regular mattresses, foam toppers don’t have valuable materials that make them attractive to recyclers.\n\nMemory foam is especially concerning for the environment when it ends up in a landfill. As it breaks down, foam can release chemicals like VOCs and flame retardants that may pollute soil and water. A foam topper can take 50 to 100 years to decompose in a landfill.\n\nReuse First: Donation Options\n\nIf your foam mattress pad is still in good shape, with no major stains, smells, or damage, donating it may give it a second life and keep it out of the landfill.\n\nLocal shelters: Homeless and domestic violence shelters often accept clean bedding. Call ahead to confirm their current needs and acceptance policies.\n\nHomeless and domestic violence shelters often accept clean bedding. Call ahead to confirm their current needs and acceptance policies. Animal rescue facilities: Many animal shelters and rescue organizations welcome foam padding for kennels and pet beds.\n\nMany animal shelters and rescue organizations welcome foam padding for kennels and pet beds. Thrift stores: Some accept mattress toppers, but policies vary by store. Check with your local Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity ReStore, or independent thrift shops before you drop anything off. Most Goodwill locations do not take these items.\n\nSome accept mattress toppers, but policies vary by store. Check with your local Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity ReStore, or independent thrift shops before you drop anything off. Most Goodwill locations do not take these items. Community sharing: You can post your topper for free on Freecycle, your local Buy Nothing group, or Facebook Marketplace. Someone in your area might need it.\n\nAlways check that a location will accept your item before you visit, and make sure anything you donate is actually usable.\n\nRecycling Options by State\n\nFour states have mattress recycling laws with programs run by the Mattress Recycling Council (MRC). These programs mainly cover full mattresses and box springs, but some places may also take foam toppers. Check with your local drop-off site to be sure.\n\nCalifornia: The Bye Bye Mattress program offers more than 240 free drop-off locations across the state. Over 99% of California residents live within 15 miles of a recycling location. Retailers who deliver a new mattress must also offer free pickup of your old one.\n\nConnecticut: The first state to launch mattress recycling in 2015, Connecticut has 157 participating municipalities. Find drop-off locations through the Bye Bye Mattress website.\n\nRhode Island: Rhode Island’s program provides collection sites and events throughout the state. Visit Bye Bye Mattress to find locations.\n\nOregon: This state-sponsored program launched in January 2025. Collection sites are available in every county. A $22.50 fee included with every new mattress purchase funds the program.\n\nNational Recycling Resources\n\nUse the Earth911 recycling search to find centers near you that take foam, bedding, or large items. Try searching for “foam,” “mattress,” or “polyurethane” with your zip code. Not every facility accepts mattress toppers, so call first to check.\n\nTextile Recycling Programs\n\nSome curbside textile recycling services will take bedding materials. Simple Recycling offers free pickup programs in many cities. Check if your area is included and if mattress pads are accepted.\n\nHard-to-Recycle Centers\n\nMany communities have special collection centers for items that can’t go in regular recycling. These are sometimes called CHaRM Centers, household hazardous waste sites, or eco-stations, and they often take foam and bulky bedding. Look up your local waste management website for details.\n\nJunk Removal Services\n\nIf local recycling isn’t an option, junk removal companies can help. Many of them try to recycle or donate items to avoid landfill fees, so they can be a good choice for foam mattress pads.\n\n1-800-GOT-JUNK operates nationwide and, when possible, recycles mattress foam into carpet padding, pet bedding, and other products.\n\nLoadUp works with local recycling and donation centers to divert materials from landfills.\n\nCollege HUNKS Hauling Junk emphasizes eco-friendly disposal.\n\nA Bedder World specializes in mattress and bedding recycling, operating in multiple states with a focus on material recovery.\n\nPrices depend on where you live and how much you need to get rid of. Get quotes from a few companies and ask them about their recycling methods.\n\nDIY Repurposing Ideas\n\nBefore you throw away your foam mattress pad, think about whether you could use it for something else:\n\nPet beds: Cut foam to size and slip it into a washable cover for a comfortable dog or cat bed.\n\nSeat cushions: Repurpose sections as padding for patio furniture, dining chairs, or workshop seating.\n\nPacking material: Cut into smaller pieces and use as cushioning when shipping fragile items.\n\nGarden kneeling pad: A foam section makes outdoor work more comfortable.\n\nCamping comfort: Use foam under sleeping bags for extra cushioning in tents or RVs.\n\nSoundproofing: Egg crate foam is sometimes used in DIY acoustic panels for home studios or workshops.\n\nBean bag filler: Shred foam and use it to restuff a sagging bean bag chair.\n\nThese ideas may not suit everyone, but finding new uses for foam helps keep it out of landfills for longer.\n\nMunicipal Waste Options\n\nIf you can’t recycle or donate your foam pad, ask your local waste management service how to dispose of it properly:\n\nBulky waste pickup: Many municipalities offer scheduled pickup for large items that don’t fit in regular trash. Foam mattress pads often qualify.\n\nTransfer station drop-off: Your local landfill or transfer station may accept bedding materials during specific hours or at designated areas.\n\nBreak it down: If you have to throw your topper out with regular trash, cutting it into smaller pieces can make it easier to bag and handle, following your local rules.\n\nCheck with your city’s waste department to learn the rules before putting foam items out for pickup.\n\nManufacturer Take-Back Programs\n\nTrue end-of-life take-back programs for mattress toppers are still rare in the industry, which is problematic given the environmental issues associated with foam disposal. Still, some brands are more responsible with returns, so it’s worth reaching out to the store where you bought your topper.\n\nAvocado Green Mattress donates 100% of mattress topper and pillow returns to their network of more than 1,000 nonprofit partners, including shelters, refugee centers, and rehabilitation facilities. This applies during their sleep trial period (up to one year for mattresses, 100 nights for select toppers). When donation isn’t possible in your area, Avocado works with recycling partners to responsibly handle the material.\n\nSleep On Latex takes an interesting approach—they sell topper returns to a local mattress refurbishing company that incorporates the material into refurbished mattresses, keeping the foam in the product lifecycle rather than sending it to landfills.\n\nSaatva offers a 180-night home trial on mattress toppers and asks that customers wash used toppers before returning them. Returned bedding items are donated to local charities, ensuring toppers in good condition find new homes rather than going to waste.\n\nTempur-Pedic recycles returned mattresses into carpet padding and other materials. However, their return policy is limited—they only accept returns for items damaged at delivery or with product defects.\n\nIf you bought your topper from a premium or “eco-friendly” brand, contact their customer service to ask about recycling or disposal options—hold them to their promise to minimize waste. Even if they don’t have a take-back program, they might know local partners who can help. Some stores also offer removal when you buy a new topper.\n\nIf your topper is made from organic latex, wool, or cotton, it will break down naturally. Natural latex can be recycled at special facilities or composted if the conditions are right. Wool and cotton toppers might be accepted by textile recycling programs or could go in your home compost. Ask the manufacturer if any chemical treatments could affect composting.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Mattress Pads\n\nFoam mattress pads are harder to recycle than most household items, but you do have options. If your pad is still in good shape, try donating it first. You can also look into state programs, local recycling centers, or junk removal services. If nothing else works, your city’s bulky waste program can handle it.\n\nEvery foam pad you keep out of the landfill means fewer chemicals in the ground and less pressure on landfill space. Your extra effort helps the environment.",
