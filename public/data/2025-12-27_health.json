      "title": "Eating more vitamin C can physically change your skin",
      "summary": "Vitamin C doesn’t just belong in skincare products—it works even better when you eat it. Scientists discovered that vitamin C from food travels through the bloodstream into every layer of the skin, boosting collagen and skin renewal. People who ate two vitamin C–packed kiwifruit daily showed thicker, healthier skin. The findings suggest glowing skin really does start from within.",
      "content": "Scientists at the University of Otago, Faculty of Medicine -- Christchurch Ōtautahi, have identified a direct connection between how much vitamin C people eat and how well their skin produces collagen and renews itself. The findings show that skin health responds measurably to dietary vitamin C, not just topical treatments.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, the research found that vitamin C levels in the skin closely mirror levels in the blood (plasma). Increasing intake through vitamin C rich foods was shown to raise both blood and skin concentrations.\n\nEating Vitamin C Raises Skin Levels and Thickness\n\nThe study followed 24 healthy adults in Aotearoa New Zealand and Germany. Participants who raised their plasma vitamin C levels by eating two vitamin C rich SunGoldTM kiwifruit each day showed a clear increase in vitamin C within their skin. This increase was associated with thicker skin (collagen production) and greater renewal of the outer skin layer.\n\nLead author Professor Margreet Vissers from Mātai Hāora -- Centre for Redox Biology and Medicine within the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine described the results as striking.\n\nThe strength of the association between skin thickness and vitamin C intake is \"compelling,\" she explained.\n\nVitamin C Moves From Blood to Skin\n\nAccording to Professor Vissers, the relationship between blood vitamin C and skin vitamin C stood out compared to other organs.\n\n\"We were surprised by the tight correlation between plasma vitamin C levels and those in the skin -- this was much more marked than in any other organ we have investigated,\" she says.\n\nThe research team also found that vitamin C circulating in the bloodstream reaches every layer of the skin and supports healthier skin function.\n\n\"We are the first to demonstrate that vitamin C in the blood circulation penetrates all layers of the skin and is associated with improved skin function. I am very proud of my team and excited about what the data is telling us.\"\n\nWhy Diet Matters More Than Creams\n\nProfessor Vissers says the findings reinforce the idea that skin health begins internally, with nutrients delivered naturally through the bloodstream.\n\nVitamin C is essential for collagen production, which is why it is commonly added to skincare products. However, vitamin C dissolves easily in water and does not absorb well through the outer skin barrier. The study showed that skin cells are highly efficient at absorbing vitamin C from the blood, with uptake into the outer epidermal layer appearing to be a priority.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted\n\nThe research was funded by New Zealand company Zespri International along with a University of Otago Research Grant and included two phases. The first phase examined the relationship between plasma and skin vitamin C levels using healthy skin tissue from patients undergoing elective surgical procedures at Te Whatu Ora Canterbury (with support from the Otago campus's He Taonga Tapu -- Canterbury Cancer Society Tissue Bank).\n\nThe second phase involved a controlled dietary intervention carried out in Christchurch and Germany. Each location included 12 healthy participants.\n\nEight Weeks of Dietary Change\n\nParticipants were asked to eat two Kiwi Gold kiwifruit daily for eight weeks. This provided the equivalent of 250 micrograms of vitamin C.\n\n\"All were instructed to consume two Kiwi Gold kiwifruit daily -- the equivalent of 250 micrograms of vitamin C -- for eight weeks. We then collected skin samples before and after the intervention, with separate analyses allowing us to look at the skin basal layers in Christchurch and the outer dermal skin layer and skin function tests in Germany,\" Professor Vissers explains.\n\nGerman participants were recruited and tested by the SGS Institute Fresenius in Hamburg, which has the technical capability to collect samples from the outer dermal skin layer (the blister \"roof\"). The institute evaluated skin regeneration using ultrasound measurements of skin thickness, elasticity UV protection and epidermal cell renewal to assess overall skin function.\n\nClear Gains in Collagen and Skin Renewal\n\nOne of the most significant findings was a measurable rise in skin thickness among participants, indicating increased collagen production along with faster regeneration of epidermal cells.\n\n\"The other really substantial finding showed a significant increase in the participants' skin thickness levels, reflecting collagen production and an upsurge in the regeneration of their epidermal cells, in other words skin renewal,\" Professor Vissers says.\n\nOther Vitamin C Foods Likely Offer Similar Benefits\n\nSunGold kiwifruit was selected for the study because of its consistently high vitamin C content. However, the researchers expect similar benefits from other vitamin C rich foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables such as citrus, berries, capsicums and broccoli.\n\n\"We suggest that increasing your dietary vitamin C intake will result in effective vitamin C uptake into all compartments of the skin,\" Professor Vissers says.\n\nDaily Intake Is Key\n\nMaintaining steady vitamin C levels in the blood is essential, since the body does not store the vitamin long term. Professor Vissers notes that healthy individuals can reach optimal plasma levels with about 250mg of vitamin C per day.\n\n\"The important thing is to keep your plasma levels optimal, which we know can be easily achieved in a healthy person with a vitamin C intake of around 250mg per day. The body however does not store the vitamin, so we recommend 5+ a day, every day, with one of those five being a high vitamin C food, as a good habit to cultivate.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long known that vitamin C is important for skin health, mostly from creams and lotions. But new research shows that eating vitamin C-rich foods can directly improve your skin from the inside.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the University of Otago in New Zealand studied 24 healthy adults in New Zealand and Germany. For eight weeks, participants ate two vitamin C-rich SunGold kiwifruits daily. The scientists measured vitamin C levels in their blood and skin before and after. They found that more vitamin C in the blood led to more vitamin C in every layer of the skin. This caused thicker skin and faster skin renewal.\n\n**Impact** – This study is important because it shows that vitamin C taken by mouth works better for skin health than creams. The vitamin travels through the bloodstream and reaches all parts of the skin, helping it produce collagen, which makes skin strong and thick. This is the first time scientists have directly shown how eating vitamin C boosts skin layers and helps skin cells renew.\n\n**What's next step** – The researchers suggest that eating more vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables, like kiwifruit, citrus, berries, and broccoli, can improve skin naturally. They recommend about 250 mg of vitamin C daily, which can be reached by eating two kiwifruits or similar foods. Future studies might explore other foods and how vitamin C helps skin with aging or damage.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Eating vitamin C-rich foods like kiwifruit increases vitamin C in your skin, making it thicker and healthier by boosting collagen and skin renewal.\n",

      "title": "This common food ingredient may shape a child’s health for life",
      "summary": "Scientists discovered that common food emulsifiers consumed by mother mice altered their offspring’s gut microbiome from the very first weeks of life. These changes interfered with normal immune system training, leading to long-term inflammation. As adults, the offspring were more vulnerable to gut disorders and obesity. The findings suggest that food additives may have hidden, lasting effects beyond those who consume them directly.",
      "content": "Researchers from the Institut Pasteur and Inserm have found that when mother mice consume dietary emulsifiers, it can negatively affect the gut microbiota of their offspring. These early changes in gut bacteria are linked to a higher risk of chronic inflammatory bowel conditions and obesity later in life. The findings point to possible health effects that extend across generations and underscore the need for human studies, particularly to understand how early-life exposure to emulsifiers may influence long-term health. The study was published in Nature Communications.\n\nEmulsifiers are additives widely used in processed foods to improve texture and extend shelf life. They are common in products such as dairy items, baked goods, ice cream, and some powdered baby formulas. Despite their widespread use, scientists still know relatively little about how these substances affect human health, especially their impact on the gut microbiota.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted\n\nThe research was led by Benoit Chassaing, Inserm Research Director and Head of the Microbiome-Host Interactions laboratory (an Inserm unit at the Institut Pasteur). In the study, female mice were given two commonly used emulsifiers, carboxymethyl cellulose (E466) and polysorbate 80 (E433), starting ten weeks before pregnancy and continuing through pregnancy and breastfeeding. The researchers then examined the gut microbiota of the offspring, which had never directly consumed these emulsifiers themselves.\n\nThe results showed that the young mice experienced noticeable changes in their gut bacteria within the first weeks of life. This period is especially important because mothers naturally pass part of their microbiota to their offspring through close contact.\n\nDisrupted Gut-Immune Communication\n\nThe altered microbiota included higher levels of flagellated bacteria, which are known to activate the immune system and promote inflammation. The researchers also observed that more bacteria were coming into close contact with the gut lining. This process, described as bacterial \"encroachment,\" caused certain gut pathways to close earlier than normal. These pathways usually allow small bacterial fragments to cross the gut lining so the immune system can recognize them and learn to tolerate the body's own microbiota.\n\nWhen these pathways closed too soon in the offspring of emulsifier-exposed mothers, communication between the gut microbiota and the immune system was disrupted. As the animals reached adulthood, this disruption led to an overactive immune response and chronic inflammation, significantly increasing the risk of inflammatory gut diseases and obesity. The study links early-life microbiota changes in mice, even without direct emulsifier consumption, to a higher likelihood of developing these chronic conditions later on.\n\nImplications for Human Health\n\n\"It is crucial for us to develop a better understanding of how what we eat can influence future generations' health. These findings highlight how important it is to regulate the use of food additives, especially in powdered baby formulas, which often contain such additives and are consumed at a critical moment for microbiota establishment. We want to continue this research with clinical trials to study mother-to-infant microbiota transmission, both in cases of maternal nutrition with or without food additives and in cases of infants directly exposed to these substances in baby formula,\" comments Benoit Chassaing, last author of the study.\n\nThis work was funded by a Starting Grant and a Consolidator Grant from the European Research Council (ERC).",
