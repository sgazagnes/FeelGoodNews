      "title": "Just 10 minutes of exercise can trigger powerful anti-cancer effects",
      "summary": "A brief, intense workout may do more than boost fitness—it could help fight cancer. Researchers found that just 10 minutes of hard exercise releases molecules into the bloodstream that switch on DNA repair and shut down cancer growth signals. When these molecules were applied to bowel cancer cells, hundreds of cancer-related genes changed activity. The discovery helps explain how exercise lowers cancer risk and hints at future therapies inspired by movement.",
      "content": "As people return to gyms or start new fitness routines in the new year, new research suggests that even a short burst of intense exercise could play a role in protecting against cancer. Scientists report that as little as 10 minutes of hard physical activity may help slow cancer growth.\n\nThe study found that brief, vigorous exercise quickly changes the mix of molecules circulating in the bloodstream. These rapid shifts appear to suppress bowel cancer cell growth while also speeding up the repair of damaged DNA.\n\nHow Exercise Changes the Bloodstream\n\nResearchers at Newcastle University discovered that exercise raises the levels of several small molecules in the blood. Many of these molecules are known to reduce inflammation, support healthy blood vessels, and improve metabolism.\n\nWhen scientists exposed bowel cancer cells in the lab to blood containing these exercise-driven molecules, they observed widespread genetic changes. More than 1,300 genes shifted their activity, including genes involved in DNA repair, energy production, and cancer cell growth.\n\nPublished in the International Journal of Cancer, the findings help clarify how physical activity may lower bowel cancer risk. The research shows that exercise sends molecular signals through the bloodstream that influence genes controlling tumor growth and genetic stability.\n\nThe results add to growing evidence that staying physically active is an important part of cancer prevention.\n\nNew Possibilities for Cancer Treatment\n\nDr. Sam Orange, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Exercise Physiology at Newcastle University and lead author of the study, said: \"What's remarkable is that exercise doesn't just benefit healthy tissues, it sends powerful signals through the bloodstream that can directly influence thousands of genes in cancer cells.\n\n\"It's an exciting insight because it opens the door to find ways that mimic or augment the biological effects of exercise, potentially improving cancer treatment and, crucially, patient outcomes.\n\n\"In the future, these insights could lead to new therapies that imitate the beneficial effects of exercise on how cells repair damaged DNA and use fuel for energy.\"\n\nSlowing Cancer Growth at the Cellular Level\n\nThe research team found that exercise increased the activity of genes that support mitochondrial energy metabolism. This helps cells use oxygen more efficiently.\n\nAt the same time, genes linked to rapid cell division were turned down, which may make cancer cells less aggressive. Blood collected after exercise also boosted DNA repair, activating a key repair gene known as PNKP.\n\nThe study included 30 volunteers, both men and women between the ages of 50 and 78. All participants were overweight or obese (a risk factor of cancer) but otherwise healthy.\n\nEach volunteer completed a short but intense cycling test that lasted about 10 minutes. Researchers then collected blood samples and examined 249 proteins. Thirteen of those proteins increased after exercise, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which plays a role in repairing damaged DNA.\n\nWhy Even One Workout Matters\n\nDr. Orange, a Clinical Exercise Physiologist at The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"These results suggest that exercise doesn't just benefit healthy tissues, it may also create a more hostile environment for cancer cells to grow.\n\n\"Even a single workout can make a difference. One bout of exercise, lasting just 10 minutes, sends powerful signals to the body.\n\n\"It's a reminder that every step, every session, counts when it comes to doing your best to protect your health.\"\n\nBowel Cancer Rates and Physical Activity\n\nBowel cancer is the 4th most common cancer in the UK, after breast, prostate and lung cancer.\n\nIn the UK, one person is diagnosed with bowel cancer every 12 minutes, adding up to nearly 44,000 cases each year. Someone dies from the disease every 30 minutes.\n\nResearchers estimate that regular physical activity lowers bowel cancer risk by about 20%. Exercise does not have to mean gym workouts or sports. Walking or biking to work, along with everyday activities such as gardening or cleaning, can also contribute.\n\nLooking ahead, the research team plans to examine whether repeated exercise sessions lead to long-lasting biological changes. They also aim to study how exercise-related effects interact with common cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",

      "title": "People in Brazil are living past 110 and scientists want to know why",
      "summary": "Scientists are uncovering why Brazil may be one of the most important yet underused resources for studying extreme longevity. Its highly diverse population harbors millions of genetic variants missing from standard datasets, including rare changes linked to immune strength and cellular maintenance. Brazilian supercentenarians often remain mentally sharp, survive serious infections, and come from families where multiple members live past 100. Together, they reveal aging not as inevitable decline, but as a form of biological resilience.",
      "content": "A Viewpoint published on January 6 in Genomic Psychiatry by Dr. Mayana Zatz and colleagues at the Human Genome and Stem Cell Research Center at the University of São Paulo explores why Brazil may be one of the most important yet overlooked settings for studying extreme human longevity. The authors combine insights from their long-running national study of exceptionally long-lived individuals with recent discoveries in supercentenarian biology to explain why Brazil offers unique scientific opportunities.\n\nWhy do a small number of people live beyond 110 years while most never reach 100? Scientists have pursued this question for decades, but clear answers remain scarce. According to Dr. Zatz and her co-authors, part of the problem lies in the narrow focus of existing research. Many large genomic databases are dominated by relatively homogeneous populations, leaving major gaps when it comes to admixed groups.\n\n\"This gap is especially limiting in longevity research, where admixed supercentenarians may harbor unique protective variants invisible in more genetically homogeneous populations,\" explains Mateus Vidigal de Castro, first author of the Viewpoint and researcher at the Human Genome and Stem Cell Research Center.\n\nBrazil's Unmatched Genetic Diversity\n\nBrazil's population history sets it apart from nearly every other country. Portuguese colonization beginning in 1500, the forced migration of roughly 4 million enslaved Africans, and later waves of European and Japanese immigration produced what the authors describe as the richest genetic diversity in the world.\n\nEarly genomic research involving more than 1000 Brazilians over age 60 uncovered around 2 million previously unknown genetic variants. Among older Brazilians alone, researchers identified more than 2,000 mobile element insertions and over 140 HLA alleles missing from global genomic databases. A later study expanded this picture further, reporting more than 8 million undescribed genetic variants across the Brazilian population, including over 36,000 thought to be potentially harmful.\n\nAn Extraordinary Group of the World's Oldest People\n\nThe research team has built a rare and valuable cohort. Their ongoing longitudinal study includes more than 160 centenarians, among them 20 validated supercentenarians, drawn from diverse regions of Brazil with wide-ranging social, cultural, and environmental backgrounds. Participants included Sister Inah, who was recognized as the world's oldest living person until her death on 30 April 2025 at age 116.\n\nThe cohort also included the two oldest men in the world. One passed away last November at age 112, while the other is currently 113 years old.\n\nLongevity Beyond Medical Access\n\nWhat makes this group especially informative is not just their age. When researchers first contacted them, several Brazilian supercentenarians were still mentally sharp and able to manage basic daily tasks on their own. Many spent most of their lives in underserved areas with little access to modern healthcare. This allows scientists to study biological resilience that developed largely without medical intervention.\n\nFamilies That Defy the Odds\n\nOne family in the study provides a striking example of inherited longevity. A 110-year-old woman in the cohort has nieces aged 100, 104, and 106, making it one of the longest-lived families ever documented in Brazil. The oldest niece, now 106, was still competing as a swimming champion at age 100.\n\nThis pattern matches previous findings showing that siblings of centenarians are between 5 and 17 times more likely to reach extreme old age themselves.\n\nCan families like this help separate genetic influences from environmental or epigenetic ones? \"Investigating such rare familial clusters offers a rare window into the polygenic inheritance of resilience and may help disentangle the genetic and epigenetic contributions to extreme longevity,\" notes Dr. de Castro.\n\nWhat Makes Supercentenarians Biologically Different\n\nThe Viewpoint also brings together recent research on the biological traits that distinguish supercentenarians from the general population. Their immune cells maintain protein recycling systems that function at levels similar to much younger people. Cellular cleanup processes remain active and efficient, helping prevent the buildup of damaged proteins.\n\nSingle-cell analyses show an unusual expansion of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells that behave more like CD8+ immune cells. This immune profile is rarely seen in younger individuals.\n\nA recent multi-omics study of a 116-year-old American-Spanish supercentenarian identified rare or exclusive variants in immune-related genes such as HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, and IL7R, along with variants tied to protein maintenance and genome stability. The authors argue that immune aging in supercentenarians should be seen not as overall decline, but as a form of adaptation that preserves function. Interestingly differently from the American-Spanish super old woman, who followed a mediterranean diet , the Brazilian supercentenarians refer no food restriction.\n\nCOVID-19 Survival at Extreme Old Age\n\nOne of the most compelling demonstrations of resilience occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three Brazilian supercentenarians in the cohort survived infection in 2020 before vaccines were available. Laboratory analyses showed strong IgG responses and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, along with immune-related proteins and metabolites linked to early host defense.\n\nHow people over 110 mounted effective immune responses to a brand-new virus that proved deadly to millions of younger individuals remains a key question. The authors suggest that preserved immune function, intact protein maintenance systems, and overall physiological stability together make supercentenarians powerful models for studying resilience.\n\nBrazil's Global Standing in Extreme Longevity\n\nBrazil's role in longevity research is further underscored by global statistics. Three of the ten longest-lived validated male supercentenarians are Brazilian, including the oldest living man, born on 5 October 1912. This is especially notable because extreme longevity is far less common in men, who typically face higher cardiovascular risk, more chronic illness, and different hormonal and immune aging patterns.\n\nHaving access to both male and female supercentenarians who lived most of their lives without modern medicine offers a rare chance to study resilience in a group that is usually underrepresented.\n\nAmong women, Brazilian supercentenarians rank prominently as well. The number of Brazilian women in the top 15 longest-lived worldwide exceeds that of more populous and wealthier countries, including the United States.\n\nNext Steps in Longevity Research\n\nThe research effort goes beyond sequencing DNA. Scientists are also developing cellular models from selected participants to conduct functional experiments and multi-omics analyses. Rather than simply confirming results from less diverse populations, the goal is to identify protective genetic variants and biological mechanisms that may be specific to Brazil's population. These findings could inform precision medicine approaches that are globally relevant while better reflecting human diversity. In collaboration with Prof. Ana Maria Caetano de Faria from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, the team will also study the immune profiles of this cohort in greater depth.\n\nThe authors urge international longevity and genomics groups to expand recruitment to include ancestrally diverse and admixed populations such as Brazil, or to provide financial support for genomic, immunological, and long-term studies that improve scientific understanding while promoting equity in global health research.\n\nResilience as the Core Insight\n\nSupercentenarians offer more than examples of unusually long lives. They demonstrate resistance, adaptability, and resilience, traits that may be just as important as lifespan itself. Rather than simply enduring old age, these individuals appear to actively counter many biological features of aging, offering clues that could improve quality of life as populations grow older.\n\n\"International longevity and genomics consortia should expand recruitment to include ancestrally diverse and admixed populations, such as Brazil's, or provide financial support for genomic, immunological, and longitudinal studies that deepen scientific insight and enhance equity in global health research,\" states Dr. Mayana Zatz, corresponding author and Professor at the University of São Paulo.\n\nThis Viewpoint brings together current knowledge on supercentenarian biology with insights from an exceptional Brazilian cohort. By integrating genomic, immune, and clinical findings, the authors present a strong case for expanding longevity research beyond traditionally studied populations and reveal patterns that remain invisible in genetically homogeneous groups.",

When researchers compared exercise with antidepressant medication, they found similar benefits, although the certainty of that evidence was lower.\n\nDepression remains a major global health challenge, affecting more than 280 million people worldwide and contributing significantly to disability. Exercise stands out as a low cost and widely accessible option that also improves physical health, making it appealing to both patients and healthcare professionals.\n\nInside the Cochrane Review\n\nThe analysis was led by researchers at the University of Lancashire and drew on data from 73 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 5,000 adults diagnosed with depression. These studies examined how exercise compared with no treatment or control conditions, as well as with psychological therapies and antidepressant drugs.\n\nOverall, the findings showed that exercise led to moderate reductions in depressive symptoms compared with no treatment. When measured against psychological therapy, exercise produced similar improvements, based on moderate certainty evidence from ten trials. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested comparable effects, but the supporting evidence was limited and considered low certainty. Few studies tracked participants after treatment ended, leaving the long-term impact unclear.\n\nSafety and Side Effects\n\nReported side effects were uncommon. People in exercise programs occasionally experienced muscle or joint injuries, while those taking antidepressants reported typical medication-related issues such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression,\" said Professor Andrew Clegg, lead author of the review. \"This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important.\"\n\nWhat Kind of Exercise Works Best\n\nThe review found that light to moderate intensity activity may be more helpful than vigorous workouts. Greater improvements in depressive symptoms were linked to completing between 13 and 36 exercise sessions.\n\nNo single form of exercise clearly outperformed others. However, programs that combined different types of activity and resistance training appeared more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Some activities, including yoga, qigong and stretching, were not evaluated in this analysis and remain areas for future study. As with other findings, long-term benefits are still uncertain due to limited follow-up.\n\nWhy Conclusions Remain Cautious\n\nThis update added 35 new trials to earlier versions of the review published in 2008 and 2013. Even with the expanded evidence base, the main conclusions changed little. Many of the included studies were small, often involving fewer than 100 participants, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions.\n\n\"Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar,\" said Professor Clegg. \"Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each.\"",

Les traitements incluent les médicaments et la thérapie psychologique, mais beaucoup recherchent des solutions abordables et accessibles.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Une grande revue menée par l'Université de Lancashire a analysé 73 études portant sur près de 5 000 adultes dépressifs. Elle a comparé l'exercice à l'absence de traitement, à la thérapie psychologique et aux antidépresseurs. L'étude a montré que l'exercice léger à modéré, pratiqué plusieurs fois, réduisait les symptômes de la dépression aussi bien que la thérapie, avec des bénéfices similaires à ceux des médicaments, bien que les preuves soient moins solides pour ces derniers.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte est importante car l'exercice est une méthode peu coûteuse et largement accessible pour aider à gérer la dépression, avec peu d'effets secondaires. Contrairement aux médicaments, il améliore aussi la santé physique. Cela offre une option alternative ou complémentaire aux patients et aux professionnels de santé.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs soulignent la nécessité d'études plus grandes et de meilleure qualité pour déterminer quels types d'exercices sont les plus efficaces, pour qui, et combien de temps durent les bienfaits. D'autres activités comme le yoga ou les étirements pourraient également être étudiées.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – Faire régulièrement de l’exercice léger à modéré peut réduire les symptômes de la dépression aussi efficacement que la thérapie psychologique, offrant une option sûre et accessible pour beaucoup.\n",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – La depresión afecta a más de 280 millones de personas en todo el mundo y es un gran desafío para la salud. Los tratamientos incluyen medicamentos y terapia psicológica, pero muchas personas buscan opciones accesibles y de bajo costo.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Una revisión amplia dirigida por la Universidad de Lancashire analizó 73 estudios con casi 5,000 adultos diagnosticados con depresión. Comparó el ejercicio con no recibir tratamiento, terapia psicológica y antidepresivos. Encontró que el ejercicio ligero a moderado en varias sesiones reduce los síntomas de depresión tan bien como la terapia, y mostró beneficios similares a los medicamentos, aunque con evidencia menos segura para estos últimos.\n\n**Impacto** – Esto es importante porque el ejercicio es una forma económica y accesible de ayudar a manejar la depresión con pocos efectos secundarios. A diferencia de los medicamentos, también mejora la salud física. Este hallazgo ofrece a las personas y profesionales de la salud una opción alternativa o adicional para el tratamiento.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores indican que se necesitan estudios más grandes y de alta calidad para saber qué tipos de ejercicio funcionan mejor, para quién y cuánto duran los beneficios. También podrían estudiarse actividades como el yoga o los estiramientos.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – El ejercicio regular de intensidad ligera a moderada puede reducir los síntomas de depresión tan efectivamente como la terapia psicológica, siendo una opción segura y accesible para muchos.\n",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – During a heart attack, the immune system sends cells called neutrophils to the injured heart. While these cells help fight infection, they can also cause extra damage to the heart.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists discovered that certain drugs can put neutrophils into a 'night mode,' lowering their activity. This reduces the damage neutrophils cause during a heart attack without weakening the immune system. The study was published in the journal Nature on January 8, 2026.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because it offers a way to protect the heart after a heart attack while keeping the body's defenses strong. It could help many patients recover better and avoid serious complications.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will likely test these drugs in more patients to confirm their safety and effectiveness. If successful, these treatments could become part of standard care for heart attack patients.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New drugs that gently reduce immune cell activity may help hearts heal better after attacks without risking infections.",
