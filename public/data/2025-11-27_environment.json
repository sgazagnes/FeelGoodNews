      "title": "Archaeologists uncover a 2,000-year-old crop in the Canary Islands",
      "summary": "Scientists decoded DNA from millennia-old lentils preserved in volcanic rock silos on Gran Canaria. The findings show that today’s Canary Island lentils largely descend from varieties brought from North Africa around the 200s. These crops survived cultural upheavals because they were so well-suited to the islands’ harsh climate. Their long-standing resilience could make them valuable for future agriculture.",
      "content": "Lentils currently cultivated in the Canary Islands have an unbroken local history that reaches back nearly 2,000 years. This remarkable continuity has been revealed by the first genetic analysis of archaeological lentils, conducted by researchers at Linköping University and the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in Spain.\n\nBecause these lentils have been shaped for centuries to thrive in hot, dry conditions, they could become an important resource for breeding crops that can cope with ongoing climate change.\n\nAncient grain silos and DNA preserved in volcanic rock\n\nMore than a thousand years ago, the Indigenous inhabitants of Gran Canaria used long-term storage methods to safeguard their harvests. They carved grain silos directly into hard volcanic rock in locations that were extremely difficult to reach. Some of the stored seeds were never retrieved. The environment inside these rock chambers was so favorable that DNA in the plant remains survived until today. For modern researchers, these age-old crops have become an extraordinary scientific resource.\n\nIn the new project, scientists examined lentils recovered from these ancient silos. By comparing DNA from the archaeological seeds with lentils that are currently cultivated in the Canary Islands, as well as in Spain and Morocco, they could follow how the crop and its cultivation have changed over time. The work is among the first studies to apply archaeological DNA techniques to legumes.\n\nWhen did lentils arrive in the Canary Islands?\n\nEuropean sailors encountered the Canary Islands off the African coast in the 1300s. At that time, the archipelago was home to communities whose ancestors had come from North Africa more than a thousand years earlier. Surviving historical accounts describe aspects of Indigenous farming as seen by Europeans, but lentils are not mentioned in those descriptions. This gap in the written record raises a key question: when, and by what route, did lentils reach the Canary Islands?\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, provides a clear answer that the crop has deep roots in the region. Genetic analyses show that many of the lentil varieties grown on the islands today descend from lentils brought by Indigenous settlers from North Africa in the 200s.\n\n\"The same type of lentils has been cultivated for almost 2,000 years in the Canary Islands. This is interesting, especially considering that the indigenous population was greatly diminished when Europeans took over the islands. But the new settlers seem to have adopted the indigenous people's crops and continued to grow them,\" says Jenny Hagenblad, senior associate professor at Linköping University, who led the study.\n\nSurvival through climate adaptation and cultural knowledge\n\nWhy did these lentils persist for so long? According to the researchers, one likely explanation is that the varieties were especially well suited to the local environment. Another possibility is that Indigenous women who married incoming settlers helped maintain knowledge about which crops to plant and how to cultivate them. Even today, women in the Canary Islands generally have more detailed knowledge than men about food plants grown in the region.\n\nThe fact that the Canary Islands have kept their original lentil types for such an extended period is more than a curious detail. Interest in the islands' culinary heritage is increasing, and many residents and visitors are eager to eat foods that connect them with local history. Lentils turn out to be a meaningful part of that cultural story.\n\n\"We also see in our study that different types of lentils are grown on different islands -- even islands where it was previously thought that lentils were never cultivated. It's important to preserve lentils from different islands, because genetic diversity can prove valuable for the future of agriculture,\" says Jonathan Santana, researcher at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.\n\nLanzarote lentils and their hidden influence on Spanish crops\n\nThe team also uncovered another intriguing pattern. \"Lenteja tipo Lanzarote,\" or Lanzarote lentil, is a popular label for lentils sold in Spanish shops. The lentils themselves are not actually produced on Lanzarote, but the name is associated with high quality. When researchers compared lentils grown on the Spanish mainland with modern lentils from the Canary Islands, DNA analyses indicated that lentils from Lanzarote had been cross-bred with Spanish varieties.\n\n\"Our results indicate that the lentils from Lanzarote have contributed not only their name but also their genes to Spanish lentils. With the climate change that is now taking place, Canarian lentils, adapted to growing in dry and warm conditions, may be of great interest for future plant breeding,\" says Jacob Morales, associate professor at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.\n\nAdvanced computing and international support\n\nThe project received financial support from several sources, including the European Research Council (ERC) and the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities. Data processing and analyses were performed using the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputers in Sweden (NAISS), which is partly funded by the Swedish Research Council.",

      "title": "Scientists discover a hidden deep sea hotspot bursting with life",
      "summary": "Beneath the waters off Papua New Guinea lies an extraordinary deep-sea environment where scorching hydrothermal vents and cool methane seeps coexist side by side — a pairing never before seen. This unusual chemistry fuels a vibrant oasis teeming with mussels, tube worms, shrimp, and even purple sea cucumbers, many of which may be unknown to science. The rocks themselves shimmer with traces of gold, silver, and other metals deposited by past volcanic activity.",
      "content": "Off the coast of Papua New Guinea, scientists have identified a previously unknown type of hydrothermal field where two different processes occur at the same time: hot hydrothermal fluids rise from below the seafloor while unusually large quantities of methane and other hydrocarbons escape from the sediments. This combination has not been documented anywhere else. The site is located about 1,300 meters deep on the slope of Conical Seamount in the western Pacific, near the island of Lihir in Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe findings were recently described in Scientific Reports.\n\nROV delivers the surprise\n\n\"We essentially have a hot vent bubbling right next to a cool gas seep -- a combination that has never been described before,\" says Dr. Philipp Brandl, marine geologist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. He was chief scientist on the SONNE expedition SO299 DYNAMET, which surveyed the Tabar-Lihir-Tanga-Feni island chain in 2023 to investigate the region's underwater volcanoes (seamounts).\n\nBrandl adds: \"No one really expected to find a hydrothermal field here, let alone one that is so exceptional.\" Earlier missions had shown hints of limited hydrothermal activity, yet this field went unnoticed during several previous research cruises. Only when the team deployed the ROV Kiel 6000 did the unusual features of the site become clear. \"It was a real surprise,\" Brandl says, \"especially for those of us who had worked in this area multiple times.\"\n\nA hybrid system of hot and cool vents\n\nHydrothermal vents and methane seeps typically appear in separate locations on the seafloor. In this instance, however, their close spacing results from the specific makeup of Conical Seamount. Thick layers of sediment rich in organic material lie beneath the volcanic edifice. Rising magma heats these buried layers, producing methane and other hydrocarbons. At the same time, the heat from the magma drives chemically rich fluids upward until they exit the seafloor as hot hydrothermal vents.\n\nBoth the heated fluids from below and the cooler, methane-filled gases from the sediments move upward through the same pathways. As a result, hot water and cold gas emerge from the seafloor only a few centimeters apart.\n\nA habitat unlike any other\n\nThis unusual arrangement creates an entirely new kind of deep-sea environment that supports an exceptionally varied community of organisms. The rocks are densely covered by Bathymodiolus mussels, tube worms, shrimp, amphipods, and vivid purple sea cucumbers. \"In places, you couldn't see a single patch of rock because everything is so densely populated,\" Brandl says. \"We are confident that some of the species there have not yet been described. However, a dedicated expedition would be needed to fully study this unique habitat.\"\n\nBecause mussels dominate the area, the research team and local observer Stanis Konabe from the University of Papua New Guinea named the site 'Karambusel'. In Tok Pisin, the word means 'mussel'.\n\nTraces of precious metals in the rock\n\nThe unusual mixture of gases at Karambusel affects both the ecosystem and the geological characteristics of the vent field. Methane levels exceed 80 percent, and hot fluids rising from below create distinctive chemical conditions in the subsurface. Gold and silver, along with arsenic, antimony, and mercury, accumulate in the surrounding rocks. These minerals indicate that the area once experienced high-temperature hydrothermal activity that deposited precious metals, even though current activity is cooler.\n\nThreats from human activity\n\nAlthough the site is remarkable for both its geology and its biology, it faces significant risks. Mining operations already occur nearby, such as at the Ladolam gold mine on Lihir, where waste material is discharged into the ocean. Additional exploration licences for seafloor minerals and hydrocarbons are in place. These activities pose threats to the delicate ecosystem and the organisms that depend on it.\n\nThe researchers urge further investigation of this region, along with careful marine spatial planning and protective measures to safeguard the site. Philipp Brandl states: \"We have discovered an unexpected treasure trove of biodiversity in the Karambusel field that needs to be protected before economic interests destroy it.\"",

      "title": "A global shipping detour just revealed a hidden climate twist",
      "summary": "Rerouted shipping during Red Sea conflicts accidentally created a massive real-world experiment, letting scientists study how new low-sulfur marine fuels affect cloud formation. The sudden surge of ships around the Cape of Good Hope revealed that cleaner fuels dramatically weaken the ability of ship emissions to seed bright, reflective clouds—cutting this cloud-boosting effect by about two-thirds.",
      "content": "When militia attacks interrupted shipping routes in the Red Sea, few people expected the effects to reach the skies above the South Atlantic. For Florida State University atmospheric scientist Michael Diamond, however, the sudden rerouting of commercial vessels created a rare chance to investigate a major climate question -- How much do cleaner fuels change how clouds form?\n\nIn a study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, Diamond and FSU Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science graduate student Lilli Boss found that new regulations cutting sulfur in marine fuel by roughly 80 percent also reduced cloud droplet formation by about 67 percent compared with older, more polluted fuels.\n\n\"The unexpected rerouting of global shipping gave us a unique opportunity to quantify aerosol-cloud interactions, reducing the largest source of uncertainty in global climate projections,\" said Diamond. \"When your 'laboratory' is the atmosphere, it's not every day you can run experiments like this one. It was an invaluable opportunity to get a more accurate picture of what's happening on Earth.\"\n\nThe results could ultimately improve global climate models and give scientists and policymakers better tools for evaluating future environmental regulations and public health protections.\n\nHow Reduced Sulfur Fuel Alters Cloud Formation\n\nIn January 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) required a large cut in sulfur content in marine fuels to curb air pollution. Tiny particles in ship exhaust, especially sulfate aerosols, play a major role in how clouds form and how bright they become. These aerosols create clouds with many small droplets, which reflect more sunlight and increase cooling at the surface. This cooling effect has historically offset about one-third of the warming produced by greenhouse gases.\n\nDespite this, the influence of aerosols remains highly uncertain. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, or CO 2 , stay in the atmosphere for centuries, while aerosols last only days or weeks. Their short lifetime, combined with the natural variability of clouds, makes aerosol-cloud interactions the biggest source of uncertainty in climate forecasts.\n\nBefore the rerouting event, Diamond's previous work showed that clouds in heavily trafficked shipping corridors contained larger and fewer droplets after IMO 2020. Scientists continue to debate how the resulting increase in sunlight reaching the ocean may have influenced the 2023 and 2024 marine heatwaves in the Atlantic Ocean. There is also disagreement about how much overall cloudiness decreased after IMO 2020, with estimates ranging from a moderate 10% drop to an extreme 80% decline.\n\nA Conflict-Driven Natural Experiment\n\nBeginning in November 2023, attacks in the Bab al-Mandab Strait dramatically reduced traffic in the Red Sea and pushed ships toward the route around the Cape of Good Hope. The South Atlantic region -- known for persistent low-level clouds that respond strongly to ship pollution -- saw a rapid increase in shipping activity.\n\nBecause these changes were caused by conflict rather than weather patterns or new policies, scientists were able to observe how clouds reacted specifically to altered ship emissions. Clear cause-and-effect situations like this are nearly impossible to recreate in controlled experiments, giving researchers a rare natural experiment.\n\nSatellite measurements showed a distinct rise in nitrogen dioxide, or NO2, across the southeastern Atlantic Ocean. NO2 is emitted by ship engines and was unaffected by the IMO 2020 sulfur rules, making it a reliable marker of increased ship traffic. This allowed researchers to directly compare cloud conditions before and after the fuel regulations under similar levels of shipping activity.\n\nWhat the Data Revealed\n\nEven with about twice as many ships passing through the region in 2024, cloud droplet formation was only slightly weaker than before IMO 2020. By comparing NO2, which remained unchanged by the regulations, with cloud droplet numbers, which respond to sulfur emissions, Diamond and Boss identified a 67% reduction in the ability of ships to influence cloud formation after the fuel rules were introduced. This finding strengthens the evidence that cleaner fuels have substantially reduced shipping's impact on cloud properties and provides an important constraint for improving future climate models.\n\nWhy These Results Matter\n\nUnderstanding how clouds react to changes in aerosol levels is still one of the most difficult aspects of climate research.\n\nThe new findings help narrow the uncertainty surrounding Earth's energy balance. With clearer information, policymakers can make more informed decisions about environmental regulations while still considering long-term climate goals. The research also highlights the complex trade-offs that arise when improving air quality, since actions that protect human health can also affect cloud-induced cooling.\n\nAlthough aerosols provide temporary cooling, they pose serious risks to people. Sulfur particles are harmful pollutants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular problems. According to estimates, the IMO regulation has already prevented tens of thousands of premature deaths.",

Aunque había el doble de barcos, las nubes formaron menos gotas después del recorte de azufre. Este descubrimiento ayuda a los científicos a entender mejor cómo los barcos afectan las nubes y el clima, mejorando los modelos climáticos y guiando futuras reglas ambientales.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores usarán estos hallazgos para mejorar las predicciones sobre el clima de la Tierra y ayudar a los responsables a equilibrar las metas de calidad del aire con los efectos climáticos. Este conocimiento puede apoyar regulaciones mejores que protejan tanto la salud pública como el medio ambiente.\n\n**Frase clave** – Un desvío global de barcos mostró inesperadamente que los combustibles más limpios reducen mucho la formación de nubes, ofreciendo nuevas ideas para mejorar las predicciones climáticas.",

      "content": "Return to a classic 2021 episode of Sustainbility In Your Ear to hear the origin story of Nth Cycle, a leading critical minerals refining company. The electrification of the economy depends on reliable access to a collection of valuable but environmentally damaging metals, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese. We talk with Megan O’Connor, cofounder and CEO of Nth Cycle, a Beverly, Mass.-based startup poised to disrupt the metal recycling industry with an electro-extraction system that can operate in very small facilities spread all over the world. The Nth Cycle process can handle up to five tons of material each day in a very compact facility — only 1,000 square feet, about the half the size of the typical retail storefront. That means in theory that materials could be recycled near the source and reused locally. And with 3D printing maturing, the idea of a locally printed car or EV battery is a very real possibility.\n\nThe Nth Cycle technology may also help to extract more metal from ore and post-processing waste materials that have been discarded by mining and smelting companies. Nth Cycle recently took second place in TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield competition, a significant accomplishment, and has raised $4.5 million.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – As the world uses more electric cars and devices, we need important metals like lithium and cobalt. These metals are hard to find and mining them can harm the environment.\n\n**What happened** – Megan O’Connor, CEO of a company called Nth Cycle, created a new way to recycle metals from old batteries. Their system uses electricity to pull metals out and can work in small factories that fit into just 1,000 square feet. This means recycling can happen close to where the metals are used, instead of far away.\n\n**Impact** – This technology can recycle up to five tons of material each day in a small space. It helps reduce waste from mining and could make it easier to reuse metals locally. For example, it might even allow making parts for electric cars nearby using 3D printing.\n\n**What's next step** – Nth Cycle will likely keep improving their system and expand to more locations. They have already won prizes and raised money to grow. This could lead to more recycling plants worldwide and less need to mine new metals.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Nth Cycle’s compact recycling technology offers a new way to recover valuable metals closer to where they are needed, reducing waste and supporting cleaner electric products.",
