      "title": "Light-printed electrodes turn skin and clothing into sensors",
      "summary": "Researchers in Sweden have unveiled a way to create high-performance electronic electrodes using nothing more than visible light and specially designed water-soluble monomers. This gentle, chemical-free approach lets conductive plastics form directly on surfaces ranging from glass to textiles to living skin, enabling surprisingly versatile electronic and medical applications.",
      "content": "Researchers at Linköping and Lund universities in Sweden have demonstrated that visible light can be used to form electrodes from conductive plastics without the need for dangerous chemicals. Their results show that these electrodes can be produced on a wide variety of surfaces, creating opportunities for new types of electronics and medical sensing technologies.\n\n\"I think this is something of a breakthrough. It's another way of creating electronics that is simpler and doesn't require any expensive equipment,\" says Xenofon Strakosas, assistant professor at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics, LOE, at Linköping University.\n\nConductive Plastics and Their Role in Electronics\n\nScientists at LOE focus on conductive plastics, also known as conjugated polymers, to advance fields such as renewable energy and medical technology. These materials combine the functional qualities of metals and semiconductors with the bendability and light weight of plastics.\n\nPolymers are made up of long chains of hydrocarbons. Each unit in the chain is called a monomer, and linking these monomers creates a polymer. The formation process, known as polymerization, is often carried out with strong or toxic chemicals, which restricts both scaling and the safe use of the materials in areas such as medicine.\n\nVisible Light Enables a Chemical-Free Polymerization Process\n\nResearchers at Campus Norrköping, collaborating with colleagues in Lund and New Jersey, have developed a technique that allows polymerization to occur using only visible light. This advance relies on specially engineered water-soluble monomers. Because the monomers activate under visible light, creating electrodes no longer requires toxic chemicals, harmful UV light or additional processing steps.\n\n\"It's possible to create electrodes on different surfaces such as glass, textiles and even skin. This opens up a much wider range of applications,\" says Xenofon Strakosas.\n\nPatterning Electrodes Directly With Light\n\nIn practical use, a solution containing the monomers is placed on a surface. By directing a laser or another light source across the material, researchers can form electrodes in detailed patterns right where they are needed. Any portion of the solution that does not undergo polymerization can be washed away, leaving the finished electrodes behind.\n\n\"The electrical properties of the material are at the very forefront. As the material can transport both electrons and ions, it can communicate with the body in a natural way, and its gentle chemistry ensures that tissue tolerates it -- a combination that is crucial for medical applications,\" says Tobias Abrahamsson, researcher at LOE and lead author of the article published in the scientific journal Angewandte Chemie.\n\nImproved Brain Signal Recording and Future Applications\n\nThe team evaluated their approach by photo-patterning electrodes directly onto the skin of anaesthetised mice. These tests revealed significantly better recordings of low-frequency brain activity compared to conventional metal EEG electrodes.\n\n\"As the method works on many different surfaces, you can also imagine sensors built into garments. In addition, the method could be used for large-scale manufacture of organic electronics circuits, without dangerous solvents,\" says Tobias Abrahamsson.\n\nVisible light can be used to create electrodes from conductive plastics completely without hazardous chemicals. This is shown in a new study carried out by researchers at Linköping and Lund universities, Sweden. The electrodes can be created on different types of surfaces, which opens up for a new type of electronics and medical sensors.\n\n\"I think this is something of a breakthrough.

Conjugated polymers combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with the flexibility of plastics.\n\nPolymers consist of long chains of hydrocarbons. Each link in the chain is called a monomer. When the monomers are connected, polymers are formed. The process, called polymerization, is often carried out using strong and sometimes toxic chemicals, which limits the ability to scale up the process and use the technology in e.g. medicine.\n\nThe Campus Norrköping researchers, together with colleagues in Lund and New Jersey, have now succeeded in creating a method where polymerization can happen using visible light only. This is possible due to specially designed water-soluble monomers developed by the researchers. Thus, no toxic chemicals, harmful UV light or subsequent processes are needed to create the electrodes.\n\n\"It's possible to create electrodes on different surfaces such as glass, textiles and even skin. This opens up a much wider range of applications,\" says Xenofon Strakosas.\n\nIn practice, the solution containing the monomers could be placed on a substrate. Using, for example, a laser or other light source, it is possible to create electrodes in intricate patterns directly on the surface. The solution that is not polymerized can then be rinsed away and the electrodes remain.\n\n\"The electrical properties of the material are at the very forefront.

      "title": "Hidden dimensions could explain where mass comes from",
      "summary": "A new theory proposes that the universe’s fundamental forces and particle properties may arise from the geometry of hidden extra dimensions. These dimensions could twist and evolve over time, forming stable structures that generate mass and symmetry breaking on their own. The approach may even explain cosmic expansion and predict a new particle. It hints at a universe built entirely from geometry.",
      "content": "The geometry of space itself may play a far more central role in physics than previously thought. Instead of serving only as the backdrop where forces act, spacetime may be responsible for the forces and particles that make up the universe.\n\nNew theoretical work suggests that the fundamental behavior of nature could arise directly from the structure of spacetime, pointing to geometry as the common origin of physical interactions.\n\nHidden Dimensions and Seven-Dimensional Geometry\n\nIn a paper published in Nuclear Physics B, physicist Richard Pincak and collaborators examine whether the properties of matter and forces can emerge from the geometry of unseen dimensions beyond everyday space.\n\nTheir research proposes that the universe includes additional dimensions that are not directly observable. These dimensions may be compact and folded into complex seven-dimensional shapes called G 2 -manifolds. Until now, such geometric structures were typically treated as fixed and unchanging. The new study instead explores what happens when these shapes are allowed to evolve over time through a mathematical process known as the G 2 -Ricci flow, which gradually alters their internal geometry.\n\nTwisting Geometry and Stable Structures\n\n\"As in organic systems, such as the twisting of DNA or the handedness of amino acids, these extra-dimensional structures can possess torsion, a kind of intrinsic twist,\" explains Pincak. This torsion introduces a built-in rotation within the geometry itself.\n\nWhen the researchers modeled how these twisted shapes change over time, they found that the geometry can naturally settle into stable patterns called solitons. \"When we let them evolve in time, we find that they can settle into stable configurations called solitons. These solitons could provide a purely geometric explanation of phenomena such as spontaneous symmetry breaking.\"\n\nRethinking the Origin of Mass\n\nIn the Standard Model of particle physics, mass arises through interactions with the Higgs field, which gives weight to particles such as the W and Z bosons. The new theory suggests a different possibility. Instead of relying on a separate field, mass may result from torsion within extra-dimensional geometry itself.\n\n\"In our picture,\" Pincak says, \"matter emerges from the resistance of geometry itself, not from an external field.\" In this view, mass reflects how spacetime responds to its own internal structure rather than the influence of an added physical ingredient.\n\nCosmic Expansion and a Possible New Particle\n\nThe researchers also connect geometric torsion to the curvature of spacetime on large scales. This relationship could help explain the positive cosmological constant associated with the accelerating expansion of the universe.\n\nBeyond these cosmological implications, the team speculates about the existence of a previously unknown particle linked to torsion, which they call the \"Torstone.\" If real, it could potentially be detected in future experiments.\n\nExtending Einstein's Geometric Vision\n\nThe broader ambition of the work is to push Einstein's idea further. If gravity arises from geometry, the authors ask whether all fundamental forces might share the same origin. As Pincak puts it, \"Nature often prefers simple solutions. Perhaps the masses of the W and Z bosons come not from the famous Higgs field, but directly from the geometry of seven-dimensional space.\"\n\nThe article published in the journal Nuclear Physics B.\n\nThe research was supported by R3 project No.09I03-03-V04-00356.",

      "title": "Researchers find how plants survive without sunlight or sex",
      "summary": "The study reveals how Balanophora plants function despite abandoning photosynthesis and, in some species, sexual reproduction. Their plastid genomes shrank dramatically in a shared ancestor, yet the plastids remain vital. Asexual reproduction appears to have evolved repeatedly, helping the plants survive in isolated, humid forest habitats. The research highlights surprising resilience in these bizarre parasitic species.",
      "content": "Some plants lack both green pigments and sexual reproduction, yet these unusual traits reveal important insights into what defines plant life. A new study involving Kobe University examined species in the genus Balanophora to understand how non-green, asexual plants develop and survive.\n\n\"My long-standing aim is to rethink what it truly means to be a plant,\" says Kobe University botanist Kenji Suetsugu. He continues, \"For many years I have been fascinated by plants that have abandoned photosynthesis, and I want to uncover the changes that occur in the process.\" Balanophora species represent an extreme case because they do not photosynthesize and instead draw nutrients from the roots of host plants. They remain underground for most of their lives and appear above the soil only during flowering season, and some species reproduce only through asexual means. \"However, while there have been individual studies on changes in the plants' genomes, their ecology and their reproduction, we don't know how they relate to each other,\" explains Suetsugu.\n\nLinking Evolution, Plastids, and Ecology in Balanophora\n\nTo address this gap, Suetsugu set out to unify three areas of research that had never been examined together for Balanophora. He aimed to clarify the relationships among species, investigate how their plastids have been altered (a part of a plant's cells which in green plants serves as the cell's \"solar panels\"), and determine how their reproductive strategies fit within their ecological context. Describing the difficulty of the work, he says: \"These plants are rare, patchy and often restricted to steep, humid forests. But years of experience with studying Balanophora both in the lab and in field studies, as well as long-standing relationships with local naturalists made this project possible.\" To expand the project, he collaborated with experts at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology who specialize in highly reduced genomes.\n\nExtreme Plastid Reduction Suggests a Shared Ancestral Shift\n\nThe study, now published in the journal New Phytologist, reports that all members of the group possess a dramatically reduced plastid genome (DNA not kept in the plant cell's nucleus but directly in the plastid). The team concluded that this reduction likely occurred in a common ancestor before the lineage split into multiple species. Suetsugu says: \"It is exciting to see how far a plant can reduce its plastid genome, which at first glance looks as though the plastid is on the verge of disappearing. But looking more closely we found that many proteins are still transported to the plastid, showing that even though the plant has abandoned photosynthesis, the plastid is still a vital part of the plant's metabolism.\"\n\nRepeated Evolution of Asexual Reproduction Across the Region\n\nThe researchers also determined that asexual reproduction probably emerged several times within the group. Their findings suggest that the plants may have developed the capacity to produce seeds without fertilization early on, which would have helped them colonize the chain of islands extending from mainland Japan through Okinawa to Taiwan. \"Over the past decade I have studied Balanophora pollination and seed dispersal where camel crickets and cockroaches play an unexpected role, but I also noticed that asexual seed production often ensured reproduction when mates or pollinators are scarce,\" explains Suetsugu. In some species, this reproductive approach may have become the primary mode of producing offspring.\n\nUnderstanding How Parasitic, Non-Photosynthetic Plants Persist\n\nFor Suetsugu, the work represents a major step toward understanding how plants that no longer perform photosynthesis continue to function and survive in natural environments. Suetsugu says, \"For someone who has spent many hours observing these plants in dark, humid forests, seeing their story unfold at the genomic level is deeply satisfying. My next goal is to connect these results with biochemical measurements to find out what Balanophora plastids actually produce and how these products help sustain the parasitic plants' growth within the roots of their hosts.\"\n\nThis research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant 23K14256), the Human Frontier Science Program (grant RGEC29/2024), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (grants JPMJPR21D6, JPMJFR2339) and the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (grant 109-2311-B-845-001).

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have found new ways to study very small living things by marking them with tiny designs. This helps researchers learn more about these creatures and how to work with them.\n\n**What happened** – In 2025, a team of researchers used a special tool called an electron beam to make tiny tattoos on tardigrades, which are microscopic animals. They did this by shining the beam on a thin layer of ice covering the tardigrade. The beam changed the ice into a sticky compound that stayed on the tardigrade’s skin after the ice melted, creating a clear pattern.\n\n**Impact** – This method is very precise and can make detailed marks on very small creatures without hurting them. It could help scientists track and study tiny living things better. The researchers believe this technique could be useful in biomedical engineering, possibly helping with medical or biological research at very small scales.\n\n**What's next step** – The scientists plan to try this tattooing method on even smaller organisms, like bacteria. If successful, it could open new ways to study and work with microscopic life in medicine and science.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Researchers have developed a new way to put tiny tattoos on microscopic animals using ice and electron beams, which could help improve biomedical research.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les scientifiques cherchent de nouvelles méthodes pour étudier de très petits êtres vivants en les marquant avec de minuscules dessins. Cela aide à mieux comprendre ces créatures et à travailler avec elles.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – En 2025, une équipe de chercheurs a utilisé un outil spécial appelé faisceau d’électrons pour réaliser de petits tatouages sur des tardigrades, des animaux microscopiques. Ils ont projeté le faisceau sur une fine couche de glace qui recouvrait le tardigrade. Le faisceau a transformé la glace en un composé collant qui est resté sur la peau du tardigrade après la fonte de la glace, créant un motif clair.\n\n**Impact** – Cette méthode est très précise et peut faire des marques détaillées sur des êtres très petits sans leur faire de mal. Elle pourrait aider les scientifiques à mieux suivre et étudier les organismes microscopiques. Les chercheurs pensent que cette technique pourrait être utile en ingénierie biomédicale, aidant la recherche médicale ou biologique à très petite échelle.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques prévoient d’essayer cette méthode de tatouage sur des organismes encore plus petits, comme les bactéries. Si cela réussit, cela pourrait ouvrir de nouvelles façons d’étudier et de travailler avec la vie microscopique en médecine et en science.\n\n**Conclusion en une phrase** – Des chercheurs ont développé une nouvelle méthode pour tatouer de minuscules animaux microscopiques avec de la glace et des faisceaux d’électrons, ce qui pourrait améliorer la recherche biomédicale.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Los científicos están buscando nuevas formas de estudiar seres vivos muy pequeños marcándolos con diseños diminutos. Esto ayuda a entender mejor a estas criaturas y cómo trabajar con ellas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – En 2025, un equipo de investigadores usó una herramienta especial llamada haz de electrones para crear tatuajes diminutos en tardígrados, que son animales microscópicos. Aplicaron el haz sobre una capa delgada de hielo que cubría al tardígrado. El haz transformó el hielo en un compuesto pegajoso que permaneció en la piel del tardígrado después de que el hielo se evaporó, formando un diseño visible.\n\n**Impacto** – Este método es muy preciso y puede hacer marcas detalladas en criaturas muy pequeñas sin dañarlas. Podría ayudar a los científicos a seguir y estudiar mejor a los organismos microscópicos. Los investigadores creen que esta técnica podría ser útil en ingeniería biomédica, ayudando en la investigación médica y biológica en escalas muy pequeñas.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos planean probar este método de tatuajes en organismos aún más pequeños, como bacterias. Si tienen éxito, esto podría abrir nuevas formas de estudiar y trabajar con la vida microscópica en medicina y ciencia.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Investigadores han desarrollado una nueva forma de poner tatuajes diminutos en animales microscópicos usando hielo y haces de electrones, lo que podría mejorar la investigación biomédica.",
