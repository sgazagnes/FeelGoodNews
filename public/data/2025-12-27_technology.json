      "title": "A new superconductor breaks rules physicists thought were fixed",
      "summary": "A shiny gray crystal called platinum-bismuth-two hides an electronic world unlike anything scientists have seen before. Researchers discovered that only the crystal’s outer surfaces become superconducting—allowing electrons to flow with zero resistance—while the interior remains ordinary metal. Even stranger, the electrons on the surface pair up in a highly unusual pattern that breaks all known rules of superconductivity.",
      "content": "Something unexpected is happening inside a material called platinum-bismuth-two (PtBi 2 ). According to a new study from researchers at IFW Dresden and the Cluster of Excellence ct.qmat, this shiny gray crystal may look ordinary, but the electrons inside it behave in ways scientists have never observed before.\n\nIn earlier work published in 2024, the team showed that only the top and bottom surfaces of PtBi 2 become superconducting, meaning electrons can pair up and flow without resistance. Their latest results reveal something even more surprising. The way these electrons pair is unlike any known superconductor. Even more intriguing, the edges surrounding these superconducting surfaces naturally host elusive Majorana particles, which are considered promising building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum bits (qubits) in future quantum computers.\n\nHow PtBi 2 Becomes a Topological Superconductor\n\nThe unusual behavior of PtBi 2 can be understood by breaking it into three key steps.\n\nTo begin with, certain electrons are confined strictly to the top and bottom surfaces of the crystal. This happens because of a topological property of PtBi 2 that arises from how electrons interact with the material's orderly atomic structure. Topological properties are remarkably stable. They do not change unless the symmetry of the entire material is altered, either by reshaping the crystal itself or by applying an electromagnetic field.\n\nWhat makes PtBi 2 especially striking is that the electrons bound to the top surface are always matched by corresponding electrons on the bottom surface, regardless of how thick the crystal is. If the crystal were sliced in half, the newly exposed surfaces would immediately develop the same surface-bound electrons.\n\nA Superconducting Surface With a Normal Interior\n\nThe second step occurs at low temperatures. The electrons confined to the surfaces begin to pair up, allowing them to move without resistance. Meanwhile, electrons inside the bulk of the material do not join this pairing and continue to behave like ordinary electrons.\n\nThis creates an unusual structure that researchers describe as a natural superconductor sandwich. The outer surfaces conduct electricity perfectly, while the interior remains a normal metal. Because the superconductivity comes from topologically protected surface electrons, PtBi 2 qualifies as a topological superconductor.\n\nOnly a small number of materials are believed to host intrinsic topological superconductivity. So far, none of those candidates has been backed by consistently strong experimental evidence. PtBi 2 now stands out as one of the most convincing examples yet.\n\nA Never-Before-Seen Pattern of Electron Pairing\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle comes from exceptionally high-resolution measurements performed in Dr. Sergey Borisenko's lab at the Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research (IFW Dresden). These experiments showed that not all surface electrons participate equally in superconductivity.\n\nElectrons moving in six specific, evenly spaced directions on the surface refuse to pair up at all. This unusual pattern reflects the three-fold rotational symmetry of how atoms are arranged on the surface of PtBi 2 .\n\nIn conventional superconductors, electrons pair regardless of the direction in which they travel. Some unconventional superconductors, including the well-known cuprates that operate at relatively high temperatures, show directional pairing with four-fold symmetry. PtBi 2 is the first known superconductor where pairing is restricted in a six-fold symmetric pattern.\n\n\"We have never seen this before. Not only is PtBi 2 a topological superconductor, but the electron pairing that drives this superconductivity is different from all other superconductors we know of,\" says Borisenko. \"We don't yet understand how this pairing comes about.\"\n\nCrystal Edges That Trap Majorana Particles\n\nThe study also confirms that PtBi 2 provides a new and practical route to producing Majorana particles, which have long been sought in condensed matter physics.\n\n\"Our computations demonstrate that the topological superconductivity in PtBi 2 automatically creates Majorana particles that are trapped along the edges of the material. In practice, we could artificially make step edges in the crystal, to create as many Majoranas as we want,\" explains Prof. Jeroen van den Brink, Director of the IFW Institute for Theoretical Solid State Physics and principal investigator of the Würzburg-Dresden Cluster of Excellence ct.qmat.\n\nMajorana particles come in pairs that together behave like a single electron, but individually act in fundamentally different ways. This idea of effectively splitting an electron is central to topological quantum computing, an approach designed to create qubits that are far more resistant to noise and errors.\n\nControlling Majoranas for Future Quantum Devices\n\nWith PtBi 2 's unusual superconductivity and edge-bound Majorana particles now identified, researchers are turning their attention to controlling these effects. One strategy involves thinning the material, which would alter the non-superconducting interior. This could transform it from a conducting metal into an insulator, preventing ordinary electrons from interfering with the Majoranas used as qubits.",

      "title": "This tiny chip could change the future of quantum computing",
      "summary": "A new microchip-sized device could dramatically accelerate the future of quantum computing. It controls laser frequencies with extreme precision while using far less power than today’s bulky systems. Crucially, it’s made with standard chip manufacturing, meaning it can be mass-produced instead of custom-built. This opens the door to quantum machines far larger and more powerful than anything possible today.",
      "content": "Researchers have achieved a significant step forward in quantum computing by developing a device that is almost 100 times thinner than the width of a human hair. The work, published in the journal Nature Communications, introduces a new type of optical phase modulator designed to precisely control laser light. This capability is essential for running future quantum computers that may rely on thousands or even millions of qubits -- the fundamental units used to store and process quantum information.\n\nJust as important as its size is how the device is made. Instead of relying on custom-built laboratory equipment, the researchers used scalable manufacturing methods similar to those that produce the processors found in computers, smartphones, vehicles, and household appliances -- essentially any technology powered by electricity (even toasters). This approach makes the device far more practical to produce in large numbers.\n\nA Tiny Device Built for Real-World Scale\n\nThe research was led by Jake Freedman, an incoming PhD student in the Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, alongside Matt Eichenfield, professor and Karl Gustafson Endowed Chair in Quantum Engineering. The team also collaborated with scientists from Sandia National Laboratories, including co-senior author Nils Otterstrom. Together, they created a device that combines small size, high performance, and low cost, making it suitable for mass production.\n\nAt the heart of the technology are microwave-frequency vibrations that oscillate billions of times per second. These vibrations allow the chip to manipulate laser light with remarkable precision.\n\nBy directly controlling the phase of a laser beam, the device can generate new laser frequencies that are both stable and efficient. This level of control is a key requirement not only for quantum computing, but also for emerging fields such as quantum sensing and quantum networking.\n\nWhy Quantum Computers Need Ultra-Precise Lasers\n\nSome of the most promising quantum computing designs use trapped ions or trapped neutral atoms to store information. In these systems, each atom acts as a qubit. Researchers interact with these atoms by directing carefully tuned laser beams at them, effectively giving instructions that allow calculations to take place. For this to work, each laser must be adjusted with extreme precision, sometimes to within billionths of a percent.\n\n\"Creating new copies of a laser with very exact differences in frequency is one of the most important tools for working with atom- and ion-based quantum computers,\" Freedman said. \"But to do that at scale, you need technology that can efficiently generate those new frequencies.\"\n\nCurrently, these precise frequency shifts are produced using large, table-top devices that require substantial microwave power. While effective for small experiments, these systems are impractical for the massive number of optical channels needed in future quantum computers.\n\n\"You're not going to build a quantum computer with 100,000 bulk electro-optic modulators sitting in a warehouse full of optical tables,\" Eichenfield said. \"You need some much more scalable ways to manufacture them that don't have to be hand-assembled and with long optical paths. While you're at it, if you can make them all fit on a few small microchips and produce 100 times less heat, you're much more likely to make it work.\"\n\nLower Power Use, Less Heat, More Qubits\n\nThe new device generates laser frequency shifts through efficient phase modulation while using about 80 times less microwave power than many existing commercial modulators. Lower power consumption means less heat, which allows more channels to be packed closely together, even onto a single chip.\n\nTaken together, these advantages transform the chip into a scalable system capable of coordinating the precise interactions atoms need to perform quantum calculations.\n\nBuilt With the Same Technology as Modern Microchips\n\nOne of the project's most important achievements is that the device was manufactured entirely in a fabrication facility, or fab, the same type of environment used to produce advanced microelectronics.\n\n\"CMOS fabrication is the most scalable technology humans have ever invented,\" Eichenfield said.\n\n\"Every microelectronic chip in every cell phone or computer has billions of essentially identical transistors on it. So, by using CMOS fabrication, in the future, we can produce thousands or even millions of identical versions of our photonic devices, which is exactly what quantum computing will need.\"\n\nAccording to Otterstorm, the team took modulator technologies that were once bulky, expensive, and power intensive and redesigned them to be smaller, more efficient, and easier to integrate.\n\n\"We're helping to push optics into its own 'transistor revolution,' moving away from the optical equivalent of vacuum tubes and towards scalable integrated photonic technologies,\" Otterstorm said.\n\nToward Fully Integrated Quantum Photonic Chips\n\nThe researchers are now working on fully integrated photonic circuits that combine frequency generation, filtering, and pulse shaping on a single chip. This effort moves the field closer to a complete, operational quantum photonic platform.\n\nNext, the team plans to partner with quantum computing companies to test these chips inside advanced trapped-ion and trapped-neutral-atom quantum computers.\n\n\"This device is one of the final pieces of the puzzle,\" Freedman said. \"We're getting close to a truly scalable photonic platform capable of controlling very large numbers of qubits.\"\n\nThe project received support from the U.S. Department of Energy through the Quantum Systems Accelerator program, a National Quantum Initiative Science Research Center.",

      "summary": "Scientists in Japan have confirmed that ultra-thin films of ruthenium dioxide belong to a newly recognized and powerful class of magnetic materials called altermagnets. These materials combine the best of two magnetic worlds: they’re stable against interference yet still allow fast, electrical readout—an ideal mix for future memory technology.",
      "content": "An international research team from NIMS, The University of Tokyo, Kyoto Institute of Technology, and Tohoku University has shown that ultra-thin films of ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) display altermagnetism. This property defines what scientists now recognize as a third fundamental category of magnetic materials. Altermagnets are drawing growing interest because they could overcome key limitations of today's magnetic memory technologies and enable faster, more compact data storage.\n\nThe researchers also found that the performance of RuO 2 thin films can be improved by carefully controlling how their crystal structure is oriented during fabrication. Their findings were published in Nature Communications.\n\nWhy Scientists Are Searching for New Magnetic Materials\n\nRuthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) has long been considered a promising candidate for altermagnetism, a recently proposed form of magnetism that differs from conventional types. Standard ferromagnetic materials used in memory devices allow data to be written easily using external magnetic fields. However, they are vulnerable to interference from stray magnetic fields, which can cause errors and limit how densely information can be stored.\n\nAntiferromagnetic materials offer much better resistance to external magnetic disturbances. The challenge is that their internal magnetic spins cancel each other out, making it difficult to read stored information using electrical signals. As a result, scientists have been searching for materials that combine magnetic stability with electrical readability and, ideally, the ability to be rewritten. While altermagnets promise this balance, experimental results for RuO 2 have varied widely around the world. Progress has also been slowed by the difficulty of producing high-quality thin films with a consistent crystallographic orientation.\n\nHow the Team Verified Altermagnetism\n\nThe research team overcame these obstacles by successfully creating RuO 2 thin films with a single crystallographic orientation on sapphire substrates. By carefully choosing the substrate and fine-tuning the growth conditions, they were able to control how the crystal structure formed.\n\nUsing X-ray magnetic linear dichroism, the researchers mapped the spin arrangement and magnetic order in the films, confirming that the overall magnetization (N-S poles) cancels out. They also detected spin-split magnetoresistance, meaning the electrical resistance changes depending on the spin direction. This effect provided electrical evidence of a spin-split electronic structure.\n\nThe experimental results matched first-principles calculations of magneto-crystalline anisotropy, confirming that the RuO 2 thin films truly exhibit altermagnetism (see Figure). Together, these findings strongly support the potential of RuO 2 thin films for next-generation high-speed, high-density magnetic memory devices.\n\nToward Faster and More Efficient Memory Devices\n\nBuilding on this work, the team plans to develop advanced magnetic memory technologies based on RuO 2 thin films. These devices could support faster and more energy-efficient information processing by taking advantage of the natural speed and density offered by altermagnetic materials.\n\nThe synchrotron-based magnetic analysis methods established during the study are also expected to help researchers identify and study other altermagnetic materials. This approach could accelerate progress in spintronics and open new pathways for future electronic devices.\n\nResearch Team and Funding\n\nThis project was conducted by a research group led by Zhenchao Wen (Senior Researcher, Spintronics Group (SG), Research Center for Magnetic and Spintronic Materials (CMSM), NIMS), Cong He (Postdoctoral Researcher, SG, CMSM, NIMS at the time of the research), Hiroaki Sukegawa (Group Leader, SG, CMSM, NIMS), Seiji Mitani (Managing Researcher, SG, CMSM, NIMS), Tadakatsu Ohkubo (Deputy Director, CMSM, NIMS), Jun Okabayashi (Associate Professor, School of Science, The University of Tokyo), Yoshio Miura (Professor, Kyoto Institute of Technology), and Takeshi Seki (Professor, Tohoku University).\n\nThe work was supported by the JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (grant numbers: 22H04966, 24H00408), the MEXT Initiative to Establish Next-Generation Novel Integrated Circuits Centers (X-NICS) (grant number: JPJ011438), the GIMRT Program of the Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, and the Cooperative Research Projects of the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University.\n\nThe study was published online in Nature Communications on September 24, 2025.",

      "content": "Both of these influencers are successful - but only one is human\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Sakshi Venkatraman US reporter Share Save\n\nKaaviya Sambasivam/Simone Mckenzie / Google Veo 3 Kaaviya Sambasivam, left, is a popular influencer. Gigi, right, is an AI influencer\n\nIn some ways, Gigi is like any other young social media influencer. With perfect hair and makeup, she logs on and talks to her fans. She shares clips: eating, doing skin care, putting on lipstick. She even has a cute baby who appears in some videos. But after a few seconds, something may seem a little off. She can munch on pizza made out of molten lava, or apply snowflakes and cotton candy as lip gloss. Her hands sometimes pass through what she's holding. That's because Gigi isn't real. She's the AI creation of University of Illinois student Simone Mckenzie - who needed to make some money over the summer. Ms Mckenzie, 21, is part of a fast-growing cohort of digital creators who churn out a stream of videos by entering simple prompts into AI chatbots, like Google Veo 3. Experts say this genre, dubbed \"AI slop\" by some critics and begrudging viewers, is taking over social media feeds. And its creators are finding considerable success. \"One video made me $1,600 in just four days,\" Ms Mckenzie said. \"I was like, okay, let me keep doing this.\" After two months, Gigi had millions of views, making Ms Mckenzie thousands through TikTok's creator fund, a programme that pays creators based on how many views they get. But she's far from the only person using AI to reach easy virality, experts said. \"It's surging right now and it's probably going to continue,\" said Jessa Lingel, associate professor and digital culture expert at the University of Pennsylvania. Its progenitors - who now can generate videos of literally anything in just a few minutes - have the potential to disrupt the lucrative influencer economy. But while some say AI is ruining social media, others see its potential to democratise who gains fame online, Lingel said. Those who don't have the money or time for a fancy background, camera setup or video editing tools can now go viral, too.\n\nSimone Mckenzie / Google Veo 3 Part of the prompt McKenzie used to create her most viral video of Gigi\n\nTraditional influencers being pushed out?\n\nSocial media influencing only recently became a legitimate career path. But in just a few years, the industry has grown to be worth over $250bn, according to investment firm Goldman Sachs. Online creators often use their own lives - their vacations, their pets, their makeup routines - to make content and attract a following. AI creators who can make the same thing - only faster, cheaper and without the constraints of reality. \"It certainly has the potential to upset the creator space,\" said Brooke Duffy, a digital and social media scholar at Cornell University. Ms Mckenzie, creator of Gigi, said videos take her only a few minutes to generate and she sometimes posts three per day. That's not feasible for human influencers like Kaaviya Sambasivam, 26, who has around 1.3 million followers across multiple platforms. Depending on the kind of video she's making - whether it's a recipe, a day-in-my life vlog, or a makeup tutorial - it may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to fully produce. She has to shop, plan, set up her background and lighting, shoot and then edit. AI creators can skip nearly all of those steps. \"It bears the question: Is this going to be something that we can out compete? Because I am a human. My output is limited,\" Ms Sambasivam, based in North Carolina, said. \"There are months where I will be down in the dumps, and I'll post just the bare minimum. I can't compete with robots.\" She started building her channel while living with her parents during the Covid pandemic. Without a set-up, she said she duct-taped her phone to the wall to film. Eventually, she spent money she made as an influencer buying tripods, lighting, makeup and food for her videos. It took years to build her following. Ms Mckenzie said she considered being a more traditional influencer, but didn't have the money, time or setup. That's why she created Gigi. \"My desk at home has a lot of books and stuff,\" she said. \"It's not the most visually appealing. It definitely makes it easier that you can just pick whatever background you want with AI.\"\n\nKaaviya Sambasivam Kaaviya Sambasivam\n\n\"Real\" life on AI videos\n\nWhen Ms Mckenzie started, she turned to Google's Veo 3 chatbot, asking it to generate a woman - someone to stand in as her. Gigi is her age, 21, with tanned skin, green eyes, freckles, winged eyeliner and long black hair. She then asked the chatbot to make Gigi talk. Gigi now starts each video chiding commentators who accuse her of being AI. Then, mockingly proving them right, she eats a bedazzled avocado or a cookie made of slime. Ms Duffy said digital alterations aren't new. First, there were programs like Photoshop, used for image editing. Next, apps like FaceTune made it easier for users to change their faces for social media. But she said the main precursor to today's hyper-realistic AI videos were celebrity deepfakes, emerging in the late 2010s. But they now look much, much more real, Ms Duffy said, and they can spread faster. AI videos run the gamut from the absurd - a cartoon of a cat working at McDonald's - to the hyper-realistic, like fake doorbell camera footage. They represent every genre - horror, comedy, culinary. But none of it is real. \"It's become, in some ways, a form of meme culture,\" Ms Duffy said. One 31-year-old American woman living in South Korea has a TikTok page dedicated to an AI-generated puppy, Gamja, who wears headphones, cooks and curls his hair. She's received millions of views as well as partnerships from companies who want to be featured in her videos. \"I wanted to blend things that people love, which include food and puppies, in a way that hadn't been done before,\" she said. One of the biggest AI content creators on TikTok is 27-year-old Daniel Riley. He has an audience of millions, but they have never seen his face. Rather, his \"time travel\" videos have earned him nearly 600,000 subscribers and tens of millions of views. \"POV: You wake up in Pompeii on eruption day\" and \"POV: You wake up as Queen Cleopatra\" are some of his most popular titles, taking viewers through a 30-second-long fictionalised day in ancient history. \"I realised I could tell stories that would normally cost millions to produce and give people a look into different eras through their phone,\" he said. And he's developed another stream of income - a bootcamp to teach others how to make similar AI videos for a monthly fee.\n\nWill anyone know the difference?",
