      "content": "Syntheses of EVT0185 and its mono-CoA derivative\n\nEVT0185 and EVT0185-CoA were synthesized at Symeres (www.symeres.com); experimental methods and compound characterization are presented in the Supplementary Information.\n\nMouse models\n\nAnimal experiments were carried out using the guidelines approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board at McMaster University (Steinberg Laboratory Animal Utilization Protocol #16-12-42, 21-01-04) or the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (IACUC approval# PROTO202100080). The tumour development was monitored based on the established progression timelines for mouse HCC models. The welfare of the animals was evaluated through observation of visible masses, impaired mobility and marked weight loss. However, no specific tumour volume end points were defined for intrahepatic tumours. All experimental procedures did not exceed the limits set by the Animal Utilization Protocol or IACUC.\n\nWD-DEN mouse model\n\nC57BL/6J male mice were housed within the McMaster University Central Animal Facility. At 2 weeks of age, mice were injected with DEN at 25 mg kg−1 body weight. After weaning, mice were housed with littermates and fed a normal chow diet (8640 22/5, Teklad). At 10 weeks of age, mice were maintained on chow diet (control) or switched to a high-fat and high-fructose diet (WD), which consisted of 40% kcal fat (mostly palm oil), 20% kcal fructose and 0.02% wt cholesterol (D19101102, Research Diets) and housed at thermoneutral conditions (26–29 oC)26. Throughout the experiments, mice were housed in ventilated cage racks with ad libitum access to food and water. An automatic timing device was used to maintain an alternating 12-h cycle of light and dark. After 29 weeks, mice were euthanized, and blood and tissues were collected.\n\n(1) For the WD-DEN Acly-KO mouse model (Figs. 1 and 5), at 2 weeks of age, C57BL-6/Aclyfl/fl mice (obtained from JAX) were injected with DEN at 25 mg kg−1 body weight. After weaning, mice were housed with littermates and fed a normal chow diet (8640 22/5, Teklad). At 10 weeks of age, mice were switched to a high-fat and high-fructose diet (WD): 40% kcal fat (mostly palm oil), 20% kcal fructose and 0.02% cholesterol (D19101102, Research Diets) and housed at thermoneutral conditions. When the mice reached 7.5 months, they were bled from the tail vein, and plasma AFP levels were determined. Animals were grouped based on their AFP levels, so there were no differences between groups, and were then injected with AAV intravenously (AAV8-YFP or AAV8-TTR-Cre) as previously described26. After 4 (early timepoint) or 8 (late timepoint) weeks following AAV injection, mice were anaesthetized using ketamine–xylazine, and terminal blood was collected by cardiac puncture. For the B cell depletion experiments, AFP levels were assessed as described above after 7.5 months, and mice were randomized before being injected with AAV intravenously (AAV8-YFP or AAV8-TTR-Cre) and intraperitoneally injected with 250 µg of isotype control (400566, BioLegend) or anti-CD20 antibody (152104, BioLegend) with tissues collected 8 weeks later. (2) For the WD-DEN EVT0185 and bempedoic acid study (Fig. 3), male mice housed within the McMaster University Central Animal Facility were used for these experiments. C57BL/6J mice were injected with DEN at 2 weeks of age and followed the above-mentioned protocol. Animals were grouped based on their AFP levels and orally gavaged with a single daily dose of vehicle (1.5% CMC and 0.2% Tween-20), EVT0185-30 or 100 mg kg−1 or bempedoic acid-100 mg kg−1. After 4 weeks of treatment, mice were anaesthetized using ketamine–xylazine, and terminal blood and tissues were collected.\n\nWD-CCl 4 HCC model\n\nMale C57BL/6J mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory were used for these experiments. Mice at 6–8 weeks of age were fed ad libitum with WD (Envigo; TD.120528, Teklad Custom Research Diet) and maintained on sugar water (fructose (23.1 g l−1) + glucose (18.9 g l−1)) for the duration of the study. Animals received weekly intraperitoneal injections of CCl 4 (0.2 μl, 100% CCl 4 per gram of body weight) throughout the study as described below.\n\nThe prevention study was conducted after 12 weeks of CCl 4 injections + WD at McMaster University with mice orally gavaged with vehicle or EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1) for 18 weeks.\n\nThe combination treatment study was conducted after 19 weeks of CCl 4 injection + WD at Mont Sinai with mice orally gavaged with EVT0185 (50 or 100 mg kg−1), sorafenib p-tosylate (sorafenib; at 15 mg kg−1; S-8502, LC Laboratories), lenvatinib mesylate (lenvatinib; 7 mg kg−1; 29832, LC Laboratories) or sorafenib + EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1) or lenvatinib + EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1).\n\nThe combination study with immunotherapy was conducted after 24 weeks of CCl 4 injections + WD at McMaster University with mice being injected with InVivoPlus anti-mouse PDL1 (B7-81; BP0101), and InVivoPlus anti-mouse VEGFR2 (DC101; BP0060) alone or in combination with EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1). Isotype controls received InVivoPlus rat IgG1 isotype control, horseradish peroxidase (HRP; BP0088) and InVivoPlus rat IgG2b isotype control, anti-keyhole limpet haemocyanin (LTF-2; BP0090) as a single intraperitoneal injection containing 200 µg of each antibody in a total volume of 100 µl. Antibodies were prepared in InVivoPure pH 7.0 Dilution Buffer (IP0070). After 6 weeks of treatment, animals were anaesthetized using ketamine–xylazine, and terminal blood was collected by cardiac puncture.\n\nWD-HCC mouse model\n\nMale C57BL/6J mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory were used for these experiments. Mice at 6 weeks of age were fed ad libitum with WD, which consisted of 40% kcal fat (mostly palm oil), 20% kcal fructose and 0.02% wt cholesterol (D19101102, Research Diets). Throughout the experiments, mice were housed at thermoneutral conditions (26–29 °C). An automatic timing device was used to maintain an alternating 12-h cycle of light and dark. After 18 months, AFP-positive mice were divided into two groups and received a single daily dose via gavage of either vehicle (1.5% CMC and 0.2% Tween-20) or EVT0185 (100 mg kg−1). After 4 weeks of treatment, mice were anaesthetized using ketamine–xylazine, and terminal blood and tissues were collected. Blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and serum was collected and stored at −80 °C freezer. The liver was weighed, a photo was taken and the number of visible lesions on the surface of the liver was counted and recorded. A portion of tumour-free liver (approximately 200 mg, caudate lobe) and tumours were removed, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for molecular analysis. The remainder of the liver was placed in 10% formalin, fixed for 48 h and stored in 70% ethanol until it was embedded in paraffin, sectioned and mounted on slides for histological analysis.\n\nOrthotopic liver cancer model\n\n1 day before surgery, male NOD-Rag1nullIL2rgnull (NRG) received intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg kg−1 cyclophosphamide and subcutaneous injections of 5 mg kg−1 carprofen. One hour before surgery, Hep3B-Luc cells were resuspended on ice in a 1:1 dilution of phenol red-free Matrigel (356237, Corning) and cold PBS (10010023, Gibco), aliquoted in 50 µl volumes at a cell density of 2 × 107 cells per millilitre. During surgery, mice were anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane (1001936040, Baxter), hair removed with 3-in-1 hair removal lotion (061700222611, Nair) and placed in a supine position on a heating pad, with nose fitted in an anaesthesia nose cone. The abdomen was disinfected and an approximately 2-cm horizontal incision was made below the left coastal margin from the midline of the abdomen. Separating the skin from the peritoneum, a second and smaller horizontal incision was made across the peritoneum to expose the liver. Next, the left lobe of the liver was withdrawn, stabilized and tumour cells were injected into the liver parenchyma while applying pressure using a cotton tipped applicator (4305, Dynarex) to enable haemostasis. Following injection, the liver was returned into the peritoneal cavity and the peritoneum was closed with multiple single interrupted sutures using 4-0 Vicryl sutures (J743D, Ethicon). The skin was closed using 9-mm wound clips (RS-9262, Roboz). Finally, mice received post-surgical subcutaneous injections of 5 mg kg−1 carprofen and were placed in cages on a heating pad containing diet recovery gel (72-06-5022, Clear H 2 O) and monitored until they were ambulatory. Mice were monitored for recovery for 7 days after surgery. Wound clips were removed on day 6, and mice were imaged for tumour progression on day 7 and weekly thereafter. Induction of in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression was achieved via supplementing drinking water with 2 mg ml−1 doxycycline (Dox; D9891, Sigma-Aldrich) and 5% sucrose starting on day 7 post-surgery and every 2–3 days thereafter. In parallel, control mice were fed with drinking water supplemented with 5% sucrose without Dox. Tumour progression was followed until the end point, which is defined as the loss of more than 20% of the body weight. Mice were culled collectively when the first mouse in the experimental cohort (Hep3B-shACLY-Luc) reached the end point. Liver and tumour tissues were weighed and collected for downstream analysis. Tumour progression was monitored via bioluminescence imaging using the IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System (124262, Perkin Elmer). Bioluminescence was achieved through intraperitoneal injection of d-luciferin dissolved in saline (S8776, Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 0.15 mg g−1 of body weight. IVIS imaging was performed on the auto-exposure setting at 10-min post-injection.\n\nDNL assays\n\nCompound screening\n\nPrimary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6J mice as previously described55 and seeded in white opaque 96-well plates, and the next day were serum starved for 2 h followed by the treatment with EVT compounds (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, 10, 30, 60 and 100 µM) in the presence of 14C-acetate (1 µCi ml−1) in a concentration-dependent manner. After 4 h of treatment, plates were washed two times with 1× PBS and 100 µl microscint fluid (Microscint O, part #601361) was added to each well. Plates were wrapped with aluminium foil and were shaken at 250 rpm for 2 h. After 2 h of shaking, 14C incorporation into the lipid fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting using a TopCount NXT Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (Perkin Elmer).\n\nTo compare the effect of bempedoic acid and EVT0185 in WT and Acly-KO mice, Aclyfl/fl mice were injected with hepatocyte-targeted AAV8-TTR expressing either YFP (WT) or Cre recombinase (Acly KO) via the tail vein to induce Acly genetic deletion as previously described26. After 2 weeks, hepatocytes from each mouse were collected and de novo lipogenesis (DNL) was assessed as previously described26. In brief, the cells were resuspended in complete William’s Media E and plated in six-well plates and allowed to adhere for 4 h. Cells were then washed with warm PBS and switched to fresh fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free (serum-free) William’s Media E for 2 h. Following a 2-h serum starvation, cells were washed in warm PBS, then treated with serum-free media supplemented with 1 µCi ml−1 [14C]-lactate (NEC599050UC, Perkin-Elmer) or 0.5 µCi ml−1 [14C]-acetate (NEC553050UC, Perkin-Elmer) for 18 h in the presence of 1 µM of EVT0185 or bempedoic acid both of which were dissolved in DMSO. After incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped with 1 M KOH/EtOH, and incubated for 2 h at 70 °C with gentle agitation. After cooling, a 1:2 mixture of H2O:n-hexane was added to each sample, vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min (1,500 rpm). The top phase was transferred to a scintillation vial combined with Ultima Gold (NC0169557, Revvity) for counting of the sterol fraction. 2 N HCl and petroleum ether were added to the remaining bottom phase, which was vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min (1,500 rpm) at room temperature. The top phase was transferred to a scintillation vial for counting of the fatty acid fraction using a TopCount NXT Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (Perkin Elmer).\n\nIn vivo assessment of liver DNL\n\nMale C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks of age) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and were fed a normal chow diet upon arrival. At approximately 10 weeks of age, mice were given a diet containing high-fat and high-fructose (rodent diet with 40% kcal fat (mostly palm oil), 20% kcal fructose and 0.02% cholesterol (D19101102, Research Diets) and housed at thermoneutral conditions (26–29 °C). After 7–8 months, the mice were divided into four groups and received a single daily dose via gavage of either vehicle (1.5% CMC and 0.2% Tween-20) or EVT0185 at a dose of 10, 30 or 60 mg kg−1 for 7 days. On the morning of day 8, animals received a final dose, and after 1 h, 14C glucose (PerkinElmer) was administered at a concentration of 12 μCi per mouse in a volume of 0.1 ml in 0.9% saline (intraperitoneal). One hour after 14C glucose was given, animals were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine–xylazine (150 mg and 12.4 mg kg−1, respectively). Blood was drawn through cardiac puncture; the liver was removed, and a sample from the left lobe was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver tissue was chipped on dry ice and the weight of the chip was weight recorded (30–50 mg of tissue). Liver tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of 2:1 chloroform:methanol using a bead homogenizer at 5,000 rpm for 2 × 12 s. Samples were incubated with gentle shaking at 4 °C for 2 h, vortexed for 2 × 12 s, and then centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and 200 μl of 0.9% saline was added. Samples were vortexed for 2 × 12 s and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Next, 200 μl of the lower organic phase was removed and added to 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The amount of radioactivity in the sample was measured by scintillation counting. The number of disintegrations per minute was determined over 5 min and normalized to the amount of liver tissue. Of plasma obtained at termination, 5–10 µl was also counted and lipid per gram of tissue counts were normalized to plasma counts.\n\nMeasurement of respiratory exchange ratio by indirect calorimetry\n\nMale C57BL/6J mice were fasted overnight (approximately 12 h) until food and 30% fructose water were again made accessible the next day at 7:30. Animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for approximately 2 h. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was monitored in metabolic cages using Oxymax/CLAMS (Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System) equipment and software (Columbus Instruments). The calorimetry system consists of metabolic cages each equipped with water bottles and food hoppers connected to monitor food intake. All animals had ad libitum access to standard rodent chow and water throughout the study. Those animals with RER > 1 were administered with or without EVT0185 at a dose of 100 mg kg−1 via gavage. Animals remained in the metabolic cages and RER was monitored for 24 h.\n\nAnalytical methods\n\nAFP ELISA\n\nPlasma AFP levels were determined using a mouse AFP Duoset ELISA kit (DY5369-05, R&D Systems) following the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 100 µl sample (1:1,000 in reagent diluent) was added to each well of a 96-well plate coated with mouse AFP capture antibody. Next, the plates were washed with wash buffer and 100 µl detection antibody was added to each well, followed by the Streptavidin HRP and substrate solution. The reaction was stopped by stop solution and the optical density of each well was measured in a microplate reader set to 450 nm.\n\nHistological analysis\n\nFollowing fixation with 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 48 h, the cassettes with a medial lobe of the liver were switched to 70% ethanol. Livers were then processed, paraffin-embedded, serially sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), antibodies targeted to CD3+ and CD19+ cells by the McMaster Immunology Research Centre Histology Core Facility. Images were taken using a Nikon 90i Eclipse upright microscope at indicated magnifications.\n\nLiver histology scores were assigned to liver sections by a pathologist who was blinded to the treatment conditions. Steatosis, inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning scores were assigned from H&E-stained liver sections as described by Kleiner et al.56. NAFLD activity scores (NAS) were obtained from the sum of these three scores. The surface area of tumour in the liver was quantified using qupath software from H&E-stained slides. The quantification of tumour CD3 and CD19-positive staining was completed from the same histological sections using HALO software by an analyst who was blinded to the treatment conditions.\n\nThe H-score system was used for ACLY immunohistochemistry evaluation on tumoural and non-tumoural hepatic tissues. This was determined by the multiplication of the percentage of cells with cytoplasmic staining intensity ordinal value (0 for no, 1 for weak, 2 for medium and 3 for strong staining), which ranges from 0 to 300 possible values. The percentage of each staining intensity was taken into account by the eye and multiplied by the staining intensity. The whole tumoural areas of each liver were evaluated in ×10 magnification as well as non-tumoural areas, and H-scores were calculated separately.\n\n$$H-{\\rm{score}}=( \\% \\,{\\rm{weak}}\\;{\\rm{staining}})(1)+( \\% \\,{\\rm{medium}}\\;{\\rm{staining}})(2)+( \\% \\,{\\rm{heavy}}\\;{\\rm{staining}})(3)$$\n\nHepatic lesions were characterized into neoplastic and non-neoplastic proliferative lesions by a histopathologist according to the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice (INHAND) guidelines57. All lesions had a hepatocellular phenotype. Non-neoplastic proliferative lesions, including foci of altered hepatocytes (FAHs), are referred to as premalignant lesions because they are composed of phenotypically altered cells demonstrating a higher risk of progression to malignancy than normal cells58,59. FAHs were defined as sharply demarcated circular, oval or irregularly shaped foci with preserved hepatic architecture and without compression of surrounding liver parenchyma. The basophilic-type FAH was the dominant type observed in this study, composed of slightly smaller hepatocytes with basophilic cytoplasm and slightly enlarged pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli, showing increased mitotic activity compared with background hepatic parenchyma. Scattered eosinophilic FAHs were also identified, composed of enlarged, polygonal hepatocytes with distinctly granular and pale pink, intensely eosinophilic or ground-glass appearance, as well as few clear cells and mixed cell types of FAHs. Neoplastic lesions as HCCs were characterized by loss of normal architecture (thickened hepatocytes plates), revealing mostly solid patterns as well as focal pseudoglandular and trabecular (micro or macro) patterns, including unpaired arteries or arterioles, consist of polygonal cells with more nuclear atypia (irregular nuclear membrane, pleomorphism, increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, multinucleation and prominent nuclei), higher mitotic rate and cytoplasmic alterations include Mallory–Denk bodies and hyaline bodies57.\n\nTranscriptome analysis\n\nBulk RNA-seq analysis\n\nRNA isolation\n\nFrozen tumour tissue (approximately 30 mg) was homogenized with Buffer RLT (RNeasy Mini Kit, 74106, Qiagen), and RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy kit (74106, Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer G2938C with the Aligent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent).\n\nRNA-seq differential gene expression analysis\n\nOnly samples passing the RNA integrity number threshold of 7.0 were used for sequencing. mRNA was enriched using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Isolation Module (NEB) followed by library preparation using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA library kit (NEB). Next-generation sequencing was conducted at the McMaster Genomics Facility, Farncombe Institute, McMaster University, using Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Illumina). Samples were randomly distributed across lanes of a HiSeq Rapid v2 flow cell to eliminate lane-specific effects, and single-end 50-bp reads were generated at 12.5 million clusters per sample. Sequence quality was assessed using FastQC followed by the removal of low-quality reads and adapter sequences using Cutadapt. Genome alignment was performed using HISAT2 and the Mus musculus mm10 reference genome. Quantification of reads was performed using feature Counts.\n\nComparison of mouse models\n\nWe obtained raw RNA-seq files for tumour samples derived from control-DEN and WD-CCl 4 models from PRJNA488497 (ref. 28) and PRJNA386995 (ref. 29), respectively. Sequencing files were processed using the same method as described for in-house samples. Count-level expression data were adjusted for surrogate batch effect across all samples using ComBat-Seq as implemented in the sva package in R. Subsequently, adjusted expression data were normalized to transcript per million. Molecular classification of Hoshida subtypes for human sample and mouse models were performed using the nearest template prediction module as implemented in the Gene Pattern platform online. Pairwise correlation between each mouse sample and each human sample were averaged on a per-model basis for mouse models, and on a per-subtype basis for human samples. Consistent with a previous report15, we validated the unique transcriptomic enrichment of the Hoshida S1 subtype60 and depletion of the S2 subtype among patients with MASH-HCC relative to HCC of mixed aetiology shown in Extended Data Fig. 1o.\n\nMicroarray\n\nMicroarray CEL files were downloaded from GSE164760. Normalization was performed using the robust multiarray average expression method implemented in Affy (v1.74.0). The HGU219 custom chip definition file was obtained from the Brainarray Microarray Lab (http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF/) and used for mapping probes to gene identifiers in a one-to-one format. Surrogate variable analysis was performed using sva (v3.44.0) to identify the presence of any unknown sources of variation by modelling different types of tissue as the variable of interest.\n\nDifferential gene expression analysis\n\nFor RNA-seq, overall and timepoint-specific differential gene expression results were obtained using the DESeq2 package (v1.36.0) by modelling the additive and interaction effect of timepoint and Acly KO. To obtain the overall result, we adjusted association of gene expression with Acly KO by a binary indicator of experimental timepoint (that is, early or late) as a confounding variable using an additive model (that is, time + Acly KO). Timepoint-specific results were obtained by modelling gene expression association using only samples belonging to either early or late timepoints. Finally, we modelled the modifying effect of timepoint on differential gene expression by using an interaction model (that is, time × Acly KO). We used a false discovery-adjusted threshold of 5% to determine gene significance. Individual sample read counts underwent variance stabilizing transformation. Gene ranks were obtained for downstream gene set enrichment analysis by performing natural logarithmic transformation of P value and applying the numerical sign of log 2 fold change based on DESeq2 result.\n\nDifferential expression analysis for microarray data was performed using limma (v3.52.3). Comparisons between tissue were performed by specifying all combinations of contrast involving MASH-HCC. Comparison using ACLY expression level as an independent variable was performed by first using a linear model to identify overall fold change direction followed by a natural cubic splines model with 5 degrees of freedom to identify gene significance.\n\nWGCNA\n\nWGCNA (v1.71) in mouse tumour tissues was restricted to genes with greater than or equal to 15 counts in 75% of samples. A soft power of 14 was selected, resulting in a scale-free topology fit of 0.875 WGCNA for human MASH-HCC samples utilized a soft power of 12, resulting in a scale-free topology fit of 0.812. We constructed signed module networks for both mouse and human datasets using the robust correlation method and restricted the number of excluded outliers to 0.10 as recommended. Modules below the hierarchical clustering height of 0.25 were merged. Significant module genes and associated traits were identified using Pearson correlation and asymptotic P value for correlation.\n\nGene Ontology and gene set enrichment analysis\n\nOver-representation and gene set enrichment analysis were conducted using clusterProfiler (v4.4.4). For over-representation analyses, we further calculated fold change as the ratio of a gene-to-background ratio. We used an adjusted P value of 0.05 as the threshold for significance. To identify clusters of similar Gene Ontology terms, we utilized the semantic similarity and binary cut method implemented in simplifyEnrichment (v1.6.1).\n\nCell-type deconvolution\n\nMouse cell-type deconvolution was performed using transcript per million normalized gene expression data and mMCP-counter (v1.1.0). Validation of B cell enrichment was performed using methods implemented in the online TIMER2.0 tool61. For human cell-type deconvolution, we used TIMER2.0 in addition to the ESTIMATE package (v1.0.13). We filtered cell types for those containing greater than 0 count in at least 75% of samples. Association with gene expression was assessed using univariate linear regression. Significance was determined using a false discovery-adjusted threshold of 5%.\n\nSpatial transcriptomic analysis\n\nLiver tissues were collected and fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 36–48 h. After fixation, the samples were immersed in a 70% alcohol solution. The liver tissues were then processed, paraffin-embedded and sectioned. RNA quality of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues was tested by TapeStation system with DV200 > 30% (DV200 (distribution value 200) refers to the percentage of RNA fragments that are greater than 200 nucleotides in length). Slides with 5 µm of tissue sections were processed with deparaffinization, H&E staining, imaging, decrosslinking, hybridization, ligation, probe extension, pre-amplification and probe-based library construction to generate gene expression libraries for each tissue for sequencing. Images were taken using the Nikon 90i Eclipse upright microscope. RNA-seq was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 2000 (P2 Flow cell, 2 × 50 bp configuration) system. Sequence data from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were analysed using the Space Ranger count pipeline from 10X Genomics for raw data processing and quality control. Downstream analyses included quality control, normalization, dimensional reduction and clustering, variable gene selection, spatially variable feature detection, annotation, differential expression and integration with multiple samples using Seurat62. Spatial transcriptomics data analyses were performed using the Linux system, R, RStudio software and Python programming language. The B cell subtypes within the tumours were examined using established markers63.\n\nscRNA-seq analysis\n\nFrozen mouse liver samples (WD-DEN and WD-CCl 4 HCC models) were minced, fixed and dissociated following the 10X Genomics ‘tissue fixation and dissociation for chromium-fixed RNA profiling’ protocol (document number CG000553, Rev B). Probe hybridization, library construction and sequencing followed the 10X Genomics ‘chromium-fixed RNA profiling reagent kits for multiplexed Samples’ (document number CG000527, Rev D). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 sequencing system (S4, 2 × 150, 2–2.5 billion reads, targeting 5,000 cells per sample at a depth of 25,000 read pairs per cell). Demultiplexing was performed using Cell Ranger via the 10X Genomics Cloud Analysis platform. Demultiplexed samples were integrated by condition and processed in R using Seurat v5.\n\nMouse–human correlation analysis was performed in R. Mouse gene symbols were converted to their 1-to-1 orthologous human EnsemblIDs using the biomaRt package. Normalized count data were filtered for each dataset to include only genes common between all datasets. Each dataset was then filtered to include only cells expressing specific marker genes (those encoding CD45, AFP or GPC3, respectively). Pairwise Pearson correlation values were calculated between the human MASH-HCC data64 and WD-CCl 4 mouse data15, using normalized gene expression in the relevant cell type. Results were visualized with the pheatmap package. Human gene-specific mean expression data were generated with Seurat (v5) in R. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess the significance of differential expression of ACLY and SLC27A2 in different human conditions, relative to the MASH-HCC condition (P < 0.05 considered significant).\n\nSingle-nucleus sequencing analysis\n\nSingle-nucleus sequencing of cells derived from healthy, MASLD, MASH-HCC tumour and tumour-adjacent tissue were obtained from GSE174748 and GSE189175 (ref. 64) and processed using the Seurat package (v5.1.0) in R. We applied sctransform to normalize RNA read counts using the default selection of 3,000 genes as the number of variable features. Transformed counts underwent dimension reduction using principal component analysis. The 30 most variable components were then selected for uniform manifold approximation and projection. Clusters were then identified using the Louvain clustering method at a resolution of 0.2. Cell types were identified using the automated cell-type assignment pipeline as implemented in the sc-type package in R65. We utilized the custom gene set containing liver-specific cell-type expression markers provided by the GepLiver resource66. SCT normalized counts were used for this analysis. Low-confidence clusters based on the default score threshold was assigned with the ‘unknown’ cell type. The proportion of cells expressing ACLY was determined for hepatocytes and malignant hepatocytes and compared between tumour and non-tumour adjacent tissues using χ2 test of independence.\n\nMIBI-TOF methods\n\nTissue staining\n\nTissues were sectioned (4-µm-thick sections) onto gold-coated MIBI slides. Slides were baked at 65 °C for 1 h, followed by deparaffinization and rehydration in sequential washes in xylene (3×), 100% ethanol (3×), 95% ethanol (2×), 70% ethanol (2×) and MIBI-water. Antigen retrieval in a pH 9 Target Antigen Retrieval Solution (DAKO Agilent) occurred at 125 °C for 40 min in a Decloaking Chamber (Biocare Medical). After cooling to room temperature, slides were washed twice in TBS-T (Ionpath). The tissue was incubated in a blocking buffer consisting of 3% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in TBS-T for 20 min. The antibody panel consisting of metal-tagged antibodies supplied by Ionpath was diluted in blocking buffer and added to the tissue for overnight incubation at 4 °C in a moisture chamber. After overnight incubation, tissues were fixed and dehydrated in sequential washes in TBS-T (3×), 2% glutaraldehyde (5 min), Tris pH 8.5 (3×), MIBI-water (2×), 70% ethanol (2×), 90% ethanol (2×), 95% ethanol (2×) and 100% ethanol (3×). Slides were stored in a desiccator before MIBIscope analysis. The antibody panels and reagents are listed in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.\n\nMIBI-TOF image acquisition\n\nSpectral images of stained liver lesions were collected using an Ionpath MIBIscope with multiplexed ion-beam imaging technology. Xenon primary ions from a Hyperion ion gun rastered across the slide to sputter stained tissue, which was detected by mass spectrometry by time of flight to reconstruct the spectral images, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, of each channel consisting of a single stained antibody. A more detailed description of the multiplexed ion-beam imaging technology has been previously described42. Spectral images of 400 × 400-µm regions of interest (ROIs) were selected with the assistance of a pathologist and the images were collected using an Ionpath MIBIscope with multiplexed ion-beam imaging technology. These high-resolution images were denoised and filtered, and with the nuclear and membrane channels, we created segmentation masks using Mesmer67. For Acly-KO cohort, 35 400 × 400-µm regions for each experimental group, representing 43,974 cell objects, were acquired, whereas for the EVT0185 cohort, 24 400 × 400-µm regions for each experimental group were collected for a total of 30,191 cell objects.\n\nLow-level image processing\n\nMultiplexed raw image sets were denoised and aggregate filtered using Ionpath’s MIBI/O software using the default correction settings. Processed image data were stored as TIFF files for further data processing and analysis.\n\nCellular segmentation\n\nWhole-cell segmentation was performed with the input of the nuclear stained and the membrane-stained marker channels using Mesmer67, and the segmentation mask images were stored as TIFF files for further analysis in R Studio.\n\nSingle-cell phenotyping\n\nSingle-cell data were extracted for all cell objects defined by the segmentation masks using a custom R script and packages described in Supplementary Table 5 (refs. 68,69,70,71). The aim of the single-cell analysis was to classify each of the objects in terms of their individual marker intensities to construct a profile of the tissue architecture and identify the proximity and relative spatial distribution of cells and features across the tumours. Marker intensities were asinh transformed by a cofactor of 1. To classify cell types based on their marker expression levels, the FlowSOM clustering algorithm was used with the Bioconductor ‘FlowSOM’ R package72. The algorithm clustered the single cells from the cohort into 100 FlowSOM clusters. By inspecting a heatmap displaying normalized individual marker intensities, we annotated each of the 100 clusters into ten cell types.\n\nSelection of representative ROIs for cellular neighbourhood spatial analysis\n\nThe tumour ROIs were selected based on the presence or high abundance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. Regions with the highest CD45-positive marker expression were selectively chosen as the representative of the cohort. The invasive margin was defined at the border of the malignant tumour and mostly consisted of approximately 50% malignant and 50% non-malignant tissue. The tumour and non-tumour regions were omitted from analysis. For each treatment group, four tumours were sampled for a total area of 1.6 mm2.\n\nCellular neighbourhood analysis\n\nWe used the imcRtools package to detect cellular neighbourhoods. A spatial graph was constructed by detecting the k-nearest neighbours in 2D per cell73. First, for each cell, we used the aggregateNeigbors function to compute the fraction of cells of a certain cell type among its neighbours. Second, for each cell, the function aggregated the expression counts across all neighbouring cells. On the basis of the fraction of the different cell types among the ten nearest neighbours, k-means clustering was used to group cells into a user-defined number of cellular neighbourhoods. The choice of six cellular neighbourhoods was determined by a parameter sweep across varying k values.\n\nLipid droplet analysis\n\nMorphometric lipid droplet analysis was adapted from the previously published article74. In brief, H&E sections of tumour-bearing livers were processed using ImageJ for the average size of lipid droplets and average lipid area. Original H&E-stained slides were converted to an 8-bit greyscale image, which was then black and white inverted. These images were used for lipid droplet analysis using the following plugin: run (‘Analyze Particles…’, ‘size = 50–20,000’, circularity = 0.50–1.00 display summarize’), which defined the upper and lower limits to a lipid droplet area (50–20,000 µm2)75 to exclude irregular-shaped structures (lipid droplets are more spherical).\n\nTumour free fatty acids\n\nQuantitation of free fatty acid levels was carried out using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–multiple reaction monitoring–mass spectrometry (UPLCMRM–MS) method as previously described76. In brief, a stock solution of fatty acids was prepared with their standard substances in LC–MS grade isopropanol:methanol (1:1). This solution was serially diluted 1:4 (v/v) to make 10 working standard solutions with the same solvent. A volume of the extractant equivalent to 2 mg of raw tissue was dried under a nitrogen gas flow. The residue was resuspended in 20 µl of LC–MS grade isopropanol:methanol (1:1). Each sample solution or 20 µl of each standard solution was then mixed in turn with 40 μl of 200 mM 3-nitro phenylhydrazine (3-NPH)-HCl solution and 40 μl of 150-mM EDC-HCl-6% pyridine solution. The mixtures were allowed to react at 40 °C for 60 min. After the reaction, 50 μl of each solution was mixed with 100 μl of a mixture of 13C6-3NPH derivatives of all the targeted organic acids. Of aliquots of the resultant solutions, 6 µl was injected onto a C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.5 µm) to run UPLCMRM–MS with (−) ion detection on an Agilent 1290 UHPLC system coupled to a Sciex 4000 QTRAP MS instrument, with the use of 1 mM ammonium acetate in water (A) and acetonitrile:isopropanol (1:1, v/v) as the mobile phase for binary-solvent gradient elution in a range of 30–100% B over 16 min at 0.4 ml min−1 and 60 °C.\n\nTumour TCA metabolites\n\nThe tumour tissues isolated were snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Around 20–30 mg tissues from each group were chipped and homogenized (with 80% methanol)77. The supernatant was dried for gas chromatography (GC)–MS sample preparation78. Dried samples were further derivatized in 50 μl of 10 mg ml−1 methoxamine hydrochloride for 60 min at 42 °C, followed by 100 μl of N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyl trifluoroacetamide for 90 min at 72 °C. Next, TCA metabolites were separated by Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph with HP-5ms Ultra Inert GC column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm, 7 inch; 19091S-433UI, Agilent). Metabolites were then analysed by Agilent 5977B mass-selective detector, using full-scan mode. Total metabolite abundances were measured as the area of the total ion counts normalized to protein content.\n\nTumour CXCL13 protein\n\nLiver tumour CXCL13 protein levels were determined using the mouse CXCL13/BLC/BCA-1 Quantikine ELISA Kit (MCX130, R&D Systems) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 50 µl of tissue homogenate was added to each well of a 96-well plate coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for mouse BLC or BCA-1 for 2 h. Next, the plates were washed with wash buffer and 100 µl mouse BLC–BCA-1 conjugate was added to each well for the next 2 h followed by the addition of substrate and stop solution. The optical density was measured using a microplate reader set at 450 nm.\n\nImmunofluorescence microscopy\n\nParaffin-embedded, 5-µm sections of tumour-bearing livers were used for immunofluorescence. Slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated and subjected to antigen retrieval (10 mM sodium citrate buffer). Slides were blocked in BSA and subsequently incubated with primary antibody overnight at a concentration of 1:500 CCP3 (Cell Signaling Technology) and Ki67 (Thermo Fisher). Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were then applied to tissues and mounted with coverslips. Slides were imaged on an inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microscope Systems). Representative images were acquired and analysed using ImageJ analysis.\n\nCell-free activity assays for ACLY, ACC1, ACC2, ACSS2 and AMPK\n\nAll cell-free assays were conducted at Reaction Biology. Human ACC1 (50202), ACC2 (50201) and ACLY (50255) were obtained from BPS Biosciences. Recombinant protein of human ACSS2, transcript variant 1 (accession no. NM_018677) tagged with MYC–DDK was obtained from Origene (TP304260). ADP-Glo (V9101, Promega) was used to measure ACLY, ACC1 and ACC2 enzyme activity following the manufacturer’s instructions. The assay was performed in two steps: (1) after the specific enzyme-mediated reaction that utilizes ATP and produces ADP, ADP-Glo reagent was added to terminate the kinase reaction and depleted the remaining ATP; and (2) kinase detection reagent was added to convert ADP to ATP and allow the newly synthesized ATP to be measured using a luciferase–luciferin reaction. The light generated, measured by the luminometer, correlated to the amount of ADP generated, which is indicative of ACLY, ACC1 or ACC2 activity. ACSS2 activity was assessed using the Bellbrook Transcreener AMP2/GMP2 Assay kit, a far-red competitive fluorescence polarization assay. AMP produced in the reaction was detected by AMP/GMP Alexa fluor 633 tracer bound to an AMP2/GMP2 antibody. AMP displaced the tracer allowing free rotation of the fluorophore and decreased fluorescence polarization, which was quantified using an appropriate multimode plate reader. Human AMPKα1–AMPKβ1–AMPKγ1 heterotrimers were co-incubated with the AMPK substrate peptide at 20 μM, AMP at 125 μM and ATP at 10 μM using the HotSpot assay.\n\nACLY competitive assay\n\nHuman recombinant ACLY was obtained from Sino Biological (11769-H07B). Recombinant full-length hACLY (accession no. P53396) was expressed in insect cells using baculovirus expression host, with a poly histidine tag at the N terminus. The molecular weight was 123 kDa. The ACLY ADP-Glo assays were performed at room temperature. Enzyme and sodium citrate were prepared in reaction buffer at three times the reaction concentration and 5 µl was added to Corning 3572 reaction plate wells. Of compound concentrations, 100× were prepared by serial dilution in 100% DMSO. Then, the compound was transferred to the reaction plate, which contains enzyme and sodium citrate, using acoustic technology. The compound and enzyme were pre-incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 5 µl of 3× coenzyme A was delivered to the reaction well, followed by 5 µl of 3× ATP to start the reaction. The assay was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. For the background wells, all assay components were added without enzyme. After a 2-h reaction, ADP-Glo reagent was added to stop the reaction and incubated for 40 min at room temperature following detection kit protocol. Then, ADP-Glo detection was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature following the detection kit protocol. The luminescence signal was measured after 30 min of incubation with ADP-Glo detection. The luminescence signal was then converted to µM ADP using ADP standard curve. The compound was tested in triplicate and each dataset was analysed separately.\n\nDetection of EVT0185-CoA thioester using LC–MS/MS method\n\nHEK293 cell culture and transfection validation\n\nHEK293 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (319-005-CL, Wisent Bioproducts) supplemented with 10% FBS (098150, Wisent Bioproducts) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmid for SLC27A1 (NM_198580, human tagged ORF clone; RC209285, OriGene), SLC27A2 (NM_003645, human tagged ORF clone; RC221033, OriGene), SLC27A4 (NM_005094, human tagged ORF clone; RC209557, OriGene), SLC27A5 (NM_012254, human tagged ORF clone; RC215758, Origene) or control vector (pCMV6-entry mammalian expression vector; PS100001, OriGene). Transfected cell lines were supplemented with G418 (A1720, Sigma-Aldrich) during maintenance at a concentration of 800 µg ml−1. Transfected SLC27A2 protein was detected by western blot using the antibody DYK tag (2368, Cell Signaling); while endogenous SLC27A2 was detected using the polyclonal antibody (PA5-30420, Invitrogen).\n\nCell treatment and extraction\n\nThe day before the experiment, HEK293 cells overexpressing SLC27A1/A2/A4/A5 were plated in six-well plates at 1–1.5 × 105 cells per cm2 in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium and cultured overnight. Cells were treated with 30 µM of EVT0185 for 3 h. At the end of the treatment period, medium was removed, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and were flash frozen in liquid N 2 . For extraction, plates were placed on ice, and cells were scraped in 266 µl of PBS per well. The cell suspension from three wells were pooled (approximately 800 µl total volume) and added to 1 ml of ice-cold 2:1 dichloromethane:methanol in a glass vial. The samples were vortexed for 2 × 12 s and then centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and filtered through a 0.45-µm PTFE filter. Samples were delivered to the Centre for Microbial Chemical Biology at McMaster University for LC–MS/MS analysis.\n\nLS–MS/MS analysis\n\nSamples were evaporated using a Turbovap LV (Biotage) evaporation system with the water bath set to 30 °C. Dried samples were resuspended in 100 µl of methanol, then analysed by injecting 5 µl into an Agilent 1290 Infinity series HPLC (Agilent) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Separation of the analytes was achieved on an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 (100 mm × 2.1 mm, internal diameter (i.d.), 3.5 µm) analytical column using mobile phases consisting of (A) 10 mM ammonium acetate in water, pH 8.5, and (B) acetonitrile and a constant flow of 0.2 ml min−1. The analytical column was maintained at 30 °C. The separation of analytes was achieved using a gradient starting at 20% B, which was held for 1.5 min. The gradient increased to 95% B over the next 3.5 min and was held for 4.5 min. The column was then re-equilibrated back to the initial conditions over the final 5.5 min. The total run time was 16 min. The HPLC eluent was introduced into the mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization in positive mode with a spray voltage of 3.6 kV. The mass spectrometer was set to acquire spectra in data-dependent acquisition mode. The full MS scan was set to an m/z range of 100–2,000 in the ion trap with a resolution of 30,000. The MS/MS was performed in the Orbitrap with a collision induced dissociation (CID) collision energy of 35. The activation time was set at 30 ms with the activation parameter q = 0.250 and an isolation window of 1.5 m/z. The resulting mass spectra were analysed using the Xcalibur 2.1 Qualitative software package.\n\nClonogenic assay\n\nHep3B (HB-8064) human hepatocarcinoma and Hepa1-6 (CRL-1830) mouse hepatoma cell lines were purchased from the ATCC and grown in eagle’s minimum essential medium (10-009-CV, Mediatech) and Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (319-005-CL, Wisent Bioproducts), respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS (098150, Wisent Bioproducts) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (15140122, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a humidified incubator at 5% CO 2 /95% air. Bempedoic acid was purchased from MedChemExpress. Hep3B and Hepa1-6 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a cell density of 1,000 and 500 cells per well, respectively. On day 2, media in each well were aspirated and replaced with 1,000 µl of fresh complete media and cells were treated with or without the respective drugs in an increasing concentration followed by the incubation of the cells for 7 days in an incubator. On day 9, the media in each well were aspirated and cells were fixed with 10% formalin (500 µl) for 10 min at room temperature. Formalin was aspirated and the plates were washed with 1× PBS and stained with crystal violet for another 10 min. After 10 min of staining, crystal violet was poured over the cells, rinsed with tap water for three times and the plates were dried overnight. The next day, colonies (more than 50 cells) were counted and analysed.\n\nCryo-EM studies on ACLY–EVT0185-CoA\n\nThe pTrcHis2-hACLY expression construct35 for full-length human ACLY (Uniprot ID P53396-2) in frame with C-terminal MYC and His tags was transformed in BL21(DE3) cells. Cultures were grown in Luria–Bertani medium at 28 °C and expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG at an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6–0.7. After overnight expression, the bacterial culture was collected by centrifugation and bacterial cells were resuspended in IMAC-binding buffer, consisting of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl supplemented with cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA (Roche). Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was clarified using a 0.22-μm filter and loaded onto a Ni Sepharose column equilibrated with IMAC-binding buffer. The IMAC column was washed and His-tagged ACLY was eluted with binding buffer supplemented with increasing concentrations of imidazole. Elution fractions were pooled and concentrated using ultracentrifugation. ACLY was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 and Superose 6 (Increase) columns with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl as a running buffer. The top fractions from the final size-exclusion chromatography elution peak were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg ml−1, aliquoted, flash frozen and stored at −80 °C in a freezer until further use.\n\nFor cryo-EM grid preparation, purified ACLY (10 mg ml−1 in HBS buffer) was supplemented with 0.5% CHAPSO, 1 mM Mg 2 ATP and 4 mM EVT0185-CoA (freshly prepared from powder). Of the sample, 4 µl was applied to a glow-discharged C-Flat 1.2/1.3 300 mesh copper grid (Protochips), blotted for 4.5 s under 99% humidity at 22 °C and plunged into liquid ethane using a GP2 Leica grid plunger. Grids were screened using a JEOL 1400 Plus microscope equipped with a JEOL Ruby CCD camera at the VIB Bioimaging Core Ghent. Data collection was performed using a JEOL cryoARM 300 microscope equipped with a 6k × 4k GATAN K3 detector resulting in 7,263 movies with a raw pixel size of 0.72 Å (BECM). Movies were processed via patch-based motion correction and contrast transfer function estimation as implemented in cryoSPARC (v3.1.0)79.\n\nParticles were extracted with a box size of 480 pixels with 2× binning. Good-quality 2D classes were initially obtained via the Blob Picker job in cryoSPARC, followed by template-based picking and neural network-based particle picking via TOPAZ as implemented in cryoSPARC80. Ensuing 2D classification, 2D class selection and removal of potential duplicate particles within a distance of 150 Å resulted in a particle set of 210,900 particles. Ab initio 3D classification (number of classes = 5) followed by homogeneous and non-uniform refinement81 without application of symmetry resulted in a 3D reconstruction that had a resolution of 3.7 Å following a gold-standard non-uniform refinement and represented the pseudo-D2-symmetric ACLY tetramer. In this cryo-EM map, the central, tetrameric CSH module was markedly better defined than the N-terminal CCS modules, indicating structural heterogeneity of the CCS modules with respect to the central CSH module.\n\nTo address this flexibility and possibly resolve the CCS–CSH assembly at a higher resolution, we applied symmetry expansion in combination with local refinement followed by 3D classification. Following homogeneous and non-uniform refinement in D2 symmetry, the associated particle set was re-extracted without binning (0.72 Å per pixel) and symmetry expanded around the D2 axes. Using the molmap function in Chimera, a volume blurred to 25 Å that contained one CCS arm and the central CSH module was generated and transformed into a mask with the Volume Tools job in cryoSPARC (map threshold = 0.09, dilation radius = 7.2 Å and soft padding width = 14.4 Å). Gold-standard local refinement was performed by limiting the rotation and shift search extent around the original consensus refinement poses to 20° and 10 Å, respectively, in combination with a Gaussian prior over the pose or shift magnitudes (with SDROT = 15 Å and SDSHIFT = 7 Å). The centre of mass of the mask was used as a fulcrum point. Ensuing 3D classification without alignment in cryoSPARC using the 3D classification job followed by another round of gold-standard local refinement resulted in a cryo-EM volume with a FSC 0.143 resolution of 3.3 Å in which the atomic models for the CSS and CSH modules (extracted from Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 6XHX) were fitted using Chimera and real-space refined in Phenix82 using reference restraints to the starting model. Cryo-EM map regions representing ligand density in the ATP-grasp fold domain of the CCS module and in the CoA-binding domain were of the CSH module modelled as Mg.ADP and the adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-diphosphate moiety of bound EVT0185-CoA, respectively. Restraints for EVT0185-CoA were generated via the de Grade Web Server (https://grade.globalphasing.org)83.\n\nA cryo-EM micrograph for the ACLY–EVT0185-CoA complex is provided in Extended Data Fig. 4b. Cryo-EM data and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard FSC 0.143 criterion84, and FSC curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution85. A map-to-model correlation was calculated using phenix.mtriage using the independent half maps as input. Local resolution maps were computed using the blocres algorithm86 as implemented in cryoSPARC with an FSC threshold of 0.5. All representations of cryo-EM Coulomb potential density maps and structural models were prepared with ChimeraX87 and PyMol88. Cryo-EM map contour sigma levels have been reported based on map normalization in Coot.\n\nMaterials availability\n\nThe protein expression construct for full-length human ACLY is available via the BCCM/GeneCorner Plasmid Collection (http://bccm.belspo.be) through the following accession code: LMBP 11277 (pTrcHis2-hACLY).\n\nCryo-EM maps following global and local refinement and the real-space-refined model for the CCS–CSH assembly have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) with the accession code EMD-53847 and in the PDB with the ID 9R90 (Extended PDB ID pdb_00009R90).\n\nGeneration of stable ACLY knockdown cell line\n\nCell culture\n\nHep3B cells (ATCC HB-8064) were cultured adherently using Eagle’s minimum essential medium (ATCC 30-2003) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (10437-028, Gibco) and 1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic solution (15240112, Gibco). HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216) was cultured adherently using Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium, high glucose (11965092, Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic solution as aforementioned along with 1% (v/v) l-glutamine (25030081, Gibco), 1% (v/v) MEM non-essential amino acids solution (11140050, Gibco) and 1% (v/v) sodium pyruvate (11360070, Gibco).\n\nPlasmid construction\n\nDox-inducible shACLY plasmid vectors were generated using the inducible EZ-Tet-pLKO-Hygro vector (Addgene plasmid no. 85972). Two ACLY shRNA sequences—5′-CGTGAGAGCAATTCGAGATTA and 5′-GGCATGTCCAAGCTCAA—and one non-targeting shRNA sequence (5′-CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCG) were ligated, transformed, amplified and validated using established protocol as previously described89.\n\nLentivirus production\n\nA second generation lentivirus production system was used to generate high-titre lentivirus. HEK293T cells were incubated with psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid no. 12260), pMD2.g (Addgene plasmid no. 12259) and the EZ-Tet-pLKO-Hygro (Addgene plasmid no. 85972) transfer plasmid at a ratio of 1:1:2 pmol in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM. Sixteen hours post-transfection, media were changed to 1% bovine serum albumin (A1470, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM Na-butyrate (3850, Tocris) supplemented with antibiotic-free DMEM (11965092, Gibco) for HEK293T cell culture. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, lentivirus media were collected and mixed with Lenti-X concentrator (631232, Takara) before storing overnight at 4 °C. Next day, lentivirus was concentrated through centrifugation at 1,500g for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended at 1:10 of initial media volume, aliquoted and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage.\n\nLentivirus transduction\n\nAn initial dilution of 1:50 v/v followed by serial dilutions of 1:4 v/v were used to transduce target cell lines at 60,000 cells per well in six-well plates using 5 µg ml−1 polybrene (107689, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented cell culture media. Cells were transduced for 24 h, followed by recovery in lentivirus-free media for another 24 h before selection of successfully transduced cells using a pre-determined, cell line-dependent concentration of hygromycin B (H3274, Sigma-Aldrich) or puromycin (P8833, Sigma-Aldrich) for 7 days. Surviving cells post-antibiotic selection were further propagated to establish stable cell line.\n\nDNL assay\n\nCells were incubated in media supplemented with 1 µCi [14C] glucose (NEC042V250UC, Perkin Elmer) and [3H] acetate (NET003005MC, Perkin Elmer) for 4 h. Subsequently, cells were washed and scraped in PBS (10010023, Gibco). Lipids were extracted using a chloroform:methanol (1:2) solution, vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min to isolate cellular debris and protein fractions from lipid supernatant. Lipids were further purified with chloroform:water (1:1) solution via vortex and centrifugation as described. Peptide concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (23225, Thermo Scientific) for normalization calculation. Of lipid supernatant, 100 µl was extracted from the non-polar chloroform phase and mixed with 5 ml of Ultima Gold Scintillation Fluid (6013329, Perkin Elmer) for radioactivity quantification.\n\nFatty acid oxidation assay\n\nCells were incubated with serum-free cell culture media supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin (A1470, Sigma-Aldrich), 500 µM sodium palmitate (P9787, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 µCi ml−1 [14C] palmitic acid (NEC075H050UC, Perkin Elmer) and 1 mM l-carnitine (11242008001, Roche) for 4 h. Cell culture supernatant was collected at the end of incubation and mixed with 1 ml of 1 M acetic acid (34256-1L-R, Fluka). Solution was sealed in a glass vial and shaken at 75 rpm at room temperature for 2 h. Released CO 2 was absorbed in 450 µl of 1 M benzethonium hydroxide (B2156, Sigma-Aldrich) during this time. Subsequently, tube containing benzethonium hydroxide was mixed with 5 ml of Ultima Gold Scintillation Fluid (6013329, Perkin Elmer) for radioactivity quantification.\n\nFor western blotting, cells were washed with cold PBS (10010023, Gibco) and scraped with 100–200 µl of cold cell lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM Na-orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100 and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail; 11836153001, Roche). Solution samples were collected and centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min at 4 °C to isolate protein fraction from cell debris. Protein samples were quantified for peptide concentration using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (23225, Thermo Scientific) according to instruction. Samples were then diluted to 1 µg µl−1 using 4× SDS sample buffer (40% glycerol, 240 mM, Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 0.04% bromophenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 20 mM dithiothreitol) and cell lysis buffer. Samples were then heated for 5 min at 95 °C before immunoblotting. SDS polyacrylamide gels were prepared at 10% or 12% polyacrylamide concentration dependent on protein size. Of the protein sample, 25 µg was loaded into each lane. Gel electrophoresis was performed first at 90 V as protein travels through the stacking gel and then at 120 V, through the separating gel. Protein samples were then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (03010040001, Roche) at 4 °C for 90 min following the standard wet transfer protocol. Subsequently, membranes were rinsed and rocked gently with 1× TBS (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 1 M HCl, pH 7.4) for three cycles of 5 min each then blocked using a TBST-BSA solution (1× TBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies (ACLY (13390; 1:1,000 dilution); p-ACLY S455 (4331; 1:1,000 dilution); and β-actin HRP conjugate (12620; 1:5,000 dilution); all Cell Signaling Technology) were diluted at 1:1,000 in TBST-BSA solution. Membranes were then cut according to protein sizes and incubated in respective antibody solutions overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The next day, primary antibody solutions were removed, and membranes were washed using TBST. Subsequently, membranes were incubated at room temperature with gentle rocking for 1 h in solutions containing 1:10,000 dilution of species-specific secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (anti-rabbit IgG HRP linked; 7074, Cell Signaling Technology). At the conclusion of incubation, membranes were washed again in TBST solution and kept in TBS solution until imaging and for storage.\n\nHuman PBMC culture and T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte proliferation assay\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from donors using the Ficoll Paque density gradient method. PBMCs were then washed with RPMI1640 and pelleted. Cells were resuspended with 10 ml of 3.5 µM CellTrace CFSE (C34570, Thermo Fisher) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After incubation, 40 ml complete RPMI1640 was added for the next 5 min to absorb excess CFSE. PBMCs were then washed, resuspended in complete RPMI1640 (10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 1% l-glutamine) and plated at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells per well in 12-well plates.\n\nFor T cell proliferation, PBMCs were induced with 3 µg ml−1 of concanavalin A (C5275, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 ng ml−1 of human recombinant IL-2 (200-02, Preprotech). For B cell proliferation, PBMCs were induced with 1 µg ml−1 of R848 (36611, mAb Tech) and 10 ng ml−1 of IL-2 (36611, mAb Tech). EVT0185 was diluted in DMSO and was added at the final concentration of 0.1 µM, 0.3 µM, 1 µM, 3 µM and 10 µM. Next, PBMCs were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 incubator for 5 days. Cells were then harvested, stained with E780 Live/Dead stain (C34570, Thermo Fisher), CD3 (300434, BioLegend) and CD19 (302241, BioLegend) antibody and analysed using flow cytometry. The results were further analysed using the FlowJo software. After 5 days, cells were then prepared for flow cytometry.\n\nFlow cytometry\n\nFor the B cell depletion study, the tail vein blood was collected from each animal after 15 days of single injection with 250 μg of anti-CD20 (152104, BioLegend) or isotype (400566, BioLegend) antibody. The red blood cells were lysed twice with 1× red blood cell lysis buffer. The samples were then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and blocked with Fc block (1:200; 553142, BD Biosciences) and stained with CD45.2 BV510 (1:25; 109838, BioLegend), B220 (1:100; 563894, BD Biosciences), CD19 (1:100; 152409, BioLegend) and 7AAD (1:100; A1310, Thermo Fisher Scientific). CytoFlex Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) was used for data acquisition and was further analysed using FlowJo (v10.5).\n\nFor PBMC analysis, the cells were harvested after 5 days of treatment and stained with E780 Live/Dead stain (C34570, Thermo Fisher), CD3 (300434, BioLegend) and CD19 (302241, BioLegend) antibody and analysed using flow cytometry. The results were further analysed using the FlowJo software.\n\nStatistical analysis and reproducibility\n\nIndependent t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed using GraphPad Prism software (v9.5.1). Correlation and regression analysis were performed using R studio. All values are reported as mean ± s.e.m. unless stated otherwise. Differences were considered significant (∗) when P < 0.05. Statistical significance between two independent groups was analysed by unpaired t-test. Representative images shown in Figs. 1e and 5g and Extended Data Figs. 1n and 9d,e were repeated at least four times. Extended Data Fig. 3d,e was repeated two times. Extended Data Fig. 4b shows a representative cryo-EM micrograph from the dataset (7,263 micrographs in total), illustrating the particle distribution and image quality. Histological scores were analysed using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test when comparing two independent groups. Wilcoxon’s test was used to analyse cell type and regional prevalence in MIBI-TOF images. Descriptions of additional software and statistical analysis used for transcriptomic analysis are mentioned in their respective methods.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

      "content": "Research animals and procedures\n\nA total of 65 rhesus macaques (M. mulatta) of Indian origin were utilized in this study (Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). All macaques were born and raised at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC). The maintenance and handling of the animals adhered to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Welfare Act and regulations, as well as the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animal care and use programme of The University of California, Davis, which oversees the CNPRC, is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, registered with the USDA, and maintains a Public Health Services Assurance. All procedures and experiments conducted for this study received approval from the University of California-Davis’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol numbers 21768, 21884, 20609, and 22373).\n\nThe primary criterion for enroling macaques in experiments involving gene therapy with AAV vectors was seronegativity for the relevant AAV capsid. To identify eligible macaques, pregnant adult females were screened for serum IgG antibodies against AAV-1 and/or AAV-8 by ELISA (see ‘Estimation of serum anti-AAV antibodies’ section) and those that were seronegative for the capsid(s) of interest were placed on hold. Dams with a history of prior live births were prioritized. The infants in groups 1–5 were vaginally delivered by dams in the outdoor colony. Those that were assigned to groups requiring AAV vector administrations at birth were removed from their mothers within 48 h of delivery and transferred to the nursery for specialized care and monitoring. Nursery-reared infants were fed a nutritionally balanced formula (Enfamil Lipil + Iron) and provided with surrogate companions, such as soft toys and blankets, to promote social and emotional development. Trained animal care staff closely monitored the infants’ health, growth and behaviour, ensuring that their physical and psychological needs were met. The infants received regular veterinary check-ups and were gradually introduced to solid foods and social housing with age-matched peers as part of their normal developmental process. The CNPRC nursery-rearing standards are designed to minimize stress and maximize the infants’ well-being, in accordance with current best practices for nonhuman primate husbandry and care in research settings. Nursery-reared infants also received high-protein chow as a supplement to formula. The diet converged over time to high-protein chow at the age of six months. All monkeys received seasonal fruits as part of the CNPRC feeding enrichment programme. Group sizes were dictated by the limited availability of AAV-8 seronegative monkeys. At least six AAV-treated and six control macaques were used in each SHIV challenge study. Efforts were made to balance groups for sex, so allocation of monkeys to each group was not random. Animal staff were not blinded to group assignments.\n\nTo identify the mothers of the infants that would be assigned to groups 7–11, we used ELISA to screen archived sera and sera collected during bi-annual physical exams for anti-AAV-8 antibodies. AAV-8 seronegative mothers-to-be were identified and their status was confirmed by a second ELISA. Monkeys that remained AAV-8 seronegative after the second ELISA were moved to indoor housing. At the time of this relocation and four weeks later, additional serum samples were collected for confirmatory AAV-8 ELISAs. If a monkey seroconverted during this quarantine screening period, it was excluded from the cohort and returned to the colony. Following three rounds of AAV screening, 16 pregnant dams remained AAV-8 seronegative and were ultimately assigned to groups A–C (Extended Data Table 2). These monkeys were then transferred to an ABSL-2 environment with specific personal protective equipment requirements to avoid transmission of wild-type AAV from the outside.\n\nThe 16 AAV-8 seronegative pregnant dams in groups A–C were scheduled to undergo caesarian section when their pregnancies reached term (approximately gestational week 24), but two dams (rhA-1 and rhA-3) delivered their babies vaginally ahead of time (Extended Data Table 2). The remaining 14 dams underwent caesarian section, which was performed by experienced veterinarians boarded by the American College of Laboratory of Animal Medicine. Initially, inhalant anaesthesia was administered, followed by surgical preparation. A laparotomy incision was made at the caudal ventral abdominal midline, and the uterus was then exteriorized. A uterotomy incision was carefully made to avoid placental sites, and the neonate was delivered. Neonatal resuscitative procedures were initiated, and the neonate was transferred to a warm workstation for monitoring. The uterotomy and the abdominal wall were closed using absorbable sutures in layers. Oxytocin was administered as needed during or after uterine closure. Following surgery, the dams were monitored in the recovery room or home cage until they maintained an upright posture. Post-surgical analgesics were administered according to standard protocols.\n\nTo deliver the recombinant bNAbs to the pregnant dams in groups B and C, the monkeys were sedated and the site over the vein where the catheter was to be placed was shaved. The area was then cleaned with gauze soaked in alcohol. During this preparation, sterility of the catheter end, which was to be inserted into the vein, was maintained. The catheter, with its stylette-bevel up, was placed on the skin. The skin was punctured with the catheter stylette, which was then introduced into the vein. While holding the stylette stable, the catheter was advanced into the vein. The stylette was then withdrawn while the catheter was held in place. An injection cap or flush syringe was attached to the catheter. The placement of the catheter was checked by flushing with a small volume of flush or fluid solution, and careful observation was made to ensure the fluid flowed into the vein without any leakage into the subcutaneous area. The catheter was then taped to the limb to secure it. For the slow infusion procedure, 30 mg kg−1 of recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1 or rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS proteins was delivered through the intravenous catheter at a rate of approximately 2.0 ml min−1. The intravenous line was flushed with saline at the end of the infusion to ensure the full amount of the bNAbs was delivered.\n\nMonkeys had to weigh at least 0.5 kg to be eligible for AAV vector inoculations. The group 1 infants were injected intramuscularly with a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing weight-adjusted amounts of two AAV-1 vectors: one expressing rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS (2.0 × 1012 genome copies (GC) per kg; VCAV-05105) and the other encoding rhesus tyrosine-protein sulfotransferase-2 (TPST-2; 5.0 × 1011 GC kg−1; VCAV-05102). TPST-2 is needed during cellular synthesis of eCD4-Ig to sulfate the tyrosines in its co-receptor mimetic peptide. The sulfopeptide in the AAV-encoded rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS molecule was mim6 (GGGGGDYYDYDGGYYYDGD). Each monkey received 400 μl of this vector inoculum, which was split evenly between 2 injections into each quadriceps muscle. The group 1 infants were treated with the aforementioned AAV-1 vectors within 24 h after birth.\n\nThe group 2 infants were treated intravenously with an AAV-8-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS (5.0 × 1012 GC kg−1; VCAV-05106) vector within 24 h of birth. Because the majority of intravenously administered AAV particles end up in the liver, where TPST-2 is constitutively expressed, no TPST-2-expressing AAV vector was delivered at this stage. The AAV-8-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS inoculum consisted of 500 μl of PBS containing a weight-adjusted dose of the vector. At postnatal week 4, the group 2 infants were treated intramuscularly with the same doses of the same AAV-1-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS and AAV-1-TPST-2 vectors given to the group 1 infants. This AAV-1 inoculum was formulated and administered as described above for group 1.\n\nThe group 3 infants were treated intramuscularly with 400 µl of a PBS solution containing 2.0 × 1012 GC kg−1 of an AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS (VCAV-04757) vector within 24 h of birth. The AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS inoculum was formulated and administered as described above for group 1. The group 3 monkey rh3-3 was euthanized at postnatal week 21 so that the remaining infants in groups 1–3 could be transitioned to paired housing.\n\nBeginning at postnatal weeks 30–34, the monkeys in groups 1–4 (except for rh3-3) were subjected to weekly oral challenges with escalating doses of a SHIV-AD8 EO stock produced in HEK293T cells. The concentration of this SHIV-AD8 EO stock was 6.6 × 105 pg ml–1 of Gag p27. For the first oral challenge, each macaque was exposed to 129 pg Gag p27, which corresponded to a 5,000-fold dilution of the stock. The appropriately diluted virus inoculum was loaded into syringes without needles in a final volume of 0.5 to 1.0 ml. The challenge dose was doubled after each exposure. Beginning at the 12th exposure, the challenge inoculum consisted of 0.5 ml of the undiluted SHIV-AD8 EO stock. Plasma was collected at the time of each challenge and tested for the presence of viral RNA (vRNA). Monkeys that remained aviraemic continued to be re-challenged in the next week. However, once a macaque experienced two consecutive episodes of positive viraemia, it was deemed to be infected and did not receive additional virus challenges. Plasma viral loads were then monitored for up to ten weeks post-infection.\n\nThe macaques in groups 5 and 6 were treated intramuscularly with the same dose of AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS given to the group 3 infants, but the vector lot was different (VCAV-06302). The AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS inoculum was formulated in PBS as described above and split into four and eight separate muscle sites for the group 5 and group 6 monkeys, respectively. Of note, the group 5 infant rh5-6 was born below the pre-specified weight criterion (≥0.5 kg) to be inoculated with an AAV vector. It took four weeks for monkey rh5-6 to gain enough weight to meet this criterion, so rh5-6 was treated with AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS one month after its group 5 counterparts.\n\nThe macaques in groups 7–11 were treated intramuscularly with 2.5 × 1012 GC kg−1 of the same lot of AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS (VCAV-06302) given to groups 5 and 6. The AAV-8-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS inoculum was formulated in PBS and split into four separate muscle injections, as described above.\n\nWhen the group 5 macaques reached ~2.5 years of age, they were subjected to weekly intrarectal challenges with a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived stock of SHIV-AD8 EO . The six rhesus macaques in group 12 served as controls for this experiment. The SHIV-AD8 EO stock used for this experiment was amplified in concanavalin A-activated rhesus PBMCs for 7 days. The Gag p27 concentration of the resulting stock was 96 ng ml–1 and each monkey in groups 5 and 12 was challenged intrarectally with 3.8 ng of Gag p27 of this stock. The challenge inoculum for each macaque consisted of 1.0 ml of PBS containing 0.5% of fetal bovine serum and 1:25 dilution of the aforementioned SHIV-AD8 EO stock. This volume was loaded into 3-ml syringes and applied intrarectally (without needle) to each macaque. Plasma was collected at the time of each challenge and tested for the presence of vRNA. Monkeys that remained aviraemic continued to be re-challenged in the next week. However, once a macaque experienced two consecutive episodes of positive viraemia or a single episode with a viral load greater than 1,000 vRNA copies ml–1 of plasma, it was deemed to be infected and did not receive additional virus challenges. Plasma viral loads were then monitored for 10 weeks after infection.\n\nSHIV RNA viral load measurements\n\nThree hundred and fifty-microliter EDTA plasma samples were collected from the infant macaques in groups 1–4 during the oral SHIV-AD8 EO challenge phase. These samples were diluted 1:1 with TRIS buffer and then RNA was extracted and analysed as previously described51. The threshold of detection on an input volume of 0.35 ml of plasma was 29 vRNA copies ml–1.\n\nPlasma viral loads from rhesus macaques in groups 5 and 12 were measured using 0.5 ml of EDTA-anticoagulated plasma based on a modification of a previously published method51. The threshold of detection on an input volume of 0.5 ml of plasma was 15 vRNA copies ml–1.\n\nProduction of monoclonal antibodies for in vivo studies\n\nThe recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1 and rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS proteins used in groups B and C were expressed by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1SP cell lines stably expressing each molecule. Both cell lines were developed and authenticated by Genscript, but they were not tested for Mycoplasma contamination. In sum, linearized plasmids encoding each molecule were transfected into CHO-K1SP cells, followed by cell pool screening and selection. The selected pools were then subjected to single clone screening using the limiting dilution method, followed by single clone batching in six-well plates. After the first batch of single clones was identified, the top six were selected for fed-batch. Based on their growth performance and productivity, the top three clones were selected for final delivery. Both molecules were purified from supernatant by affinity chromatography, followed by cation exchange and ultrafiltration–diafiltration. Both molecules were formulated in citrate buffer (20 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.0, 0.02% Tween-80) at a concentration of ~10.5 mg ml–1. The endotoxin level was less than 1.0 endotoxin units per mg of protein, as determined by the limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL)/tachypleus amebocyte lysate (TAL) assay. The rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS molecule (lot U086PGG21009/202201) was produced and purified by Genscript, and the rh-3BNC117-IgG1 protein (RRID: AB_2895627, lot JH21-08) was produced and purified by MassBiologics.\n\nAAV vectors\n\nThree single-stranded AAV transfer plasmids were used to produce the recombinant AAV vectors described in this study. The first one encoded rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS and was used to prepare the AAV-8 vector used in group 3 and groups 5–11. Transgene expression was under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. A simian virus 40 (SV40) intron was placed between the promoter and the rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS transgene. To reduce the immunogenicity of this vector, the promoter and transgene sequences lacked CpG motifs that can serve as ligands for TLR952. The rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS transgene was bicistronic; that is, both heavy and light chains of IgG1 were expressed from one open reading frame using an F2A ‘self-processing’ peptide from foot-and-mouth disease virus. The cleavage sequence RKRR for the cellular protease furin is added for removal of amino acids that were left on the heavy chain C-terminus following F2A self-processing. The peptide linker SGSG is added for improved furin enzyme-mediated cleavage. Additionally, the 3′ untranslated region contains multiple binding sites for conserved endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) that are specifically expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs). These miRNA binding sites were included to render the monoclonal antibody transcripts sensitive to translational inhibition by the miRNAs expressed in pAPCs. The second AAV expression cassette encoded a rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS molecule and was used to prepare the AAV-1 and AAV-8 vectors used in groups 1 and 2. Additional relevant features about the rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS protein include an I39N substitution in the CD4 domains intended to increase HIV neutralization potency and the use of mim6 (GGGGGDYYDYDGGYYYDGD) as the carboxyl-terminus co-receptor mimetic peptide. Transgene expression was under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter with a CMV enhancer and an SV40 intron. Downstream from the rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS transgene was the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element, which was intended to increase transgene expression. The third AAV expression cassette encoded rh-TPST-2 and was used to prepare the AAV-1-rh-TPST-2 construct that was co-delivered with the AAV-1-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS vector during the intramuscular inoculations of the group 1 and group 2 monkeys. The promoter structure of this vector consisted of the CMV promoter and CMV enhancer, followed by the SV40 intron. All AAV expression cassettes used in this study contained the SV40 poly-adenylation signal and were flanked by AAV-2 inverted terminal repeats. All recombinant AAV vectors used in this study were produced at the Horae Gene Therapy Center and Vector Core at the UMass Chan Medical School as described previously53. In brief, HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, authenticated and tested negative for Mycoplasma contamination) were co-transfected with each transfer plasmid, a plasmid co-expressing the AAV-2 Rep protein with the AAV-1 or AAV-8 capsid, and a helper plasmid encoding adenovirus genes. After collecting lysates of transfected cells, AAV was purified through three sequential CsCl centrifugation steps. The vector GC number per ml was determined by quantitative PCR. The purity of the AAV preparations was verified by silver-stained SDS–PAGE.\n\nRNA-seq analysis\n\nFollowing collection of peripheral blood (~0.5 ml per time point) in BD PAXgene tubes, the tubes were gently inverted 8–10 times and stored vertically at room temperature for a minimum of 2 h. The tubes were then transferred to a −80 °C freezer where they were stored until the time of the RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using a Paxgene Blood miRNA kit (Qiagen 763134), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA was eluted in buffer BR5 (supplied in the kit), incubated at 65 °C for 5 min for RNA denaturation, and stored immediately at −80 °C. RNA samples were shipped on dry ice to Novogene for RNA quality control, library preparation and RNA sequencing. cDNA libraries were prepared at Novogene from total RNA using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB E7770L). Sequencing was performed on a Novaseq 6000 instrument (Illumina).\n\nAfter initial quality control, the sequence data were quantified using Kallisto54, to obtain transcript level abundances using Mmul_10 (Ensembl) as reference. Following quantification, DEGs and differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) were identified using Sleuth55. The DETs were identified in samples collected on day 3 and week 4 vs. baseline (day 0) post-AAV vector administration in group 5 and group 6, respectively. We performed a similar analysis in infants in group 7 and in those in groups 8 and 9. Significant DETs were defined using a q-value (Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value) threshold of <0.05. Over-representation analysis was performed using the Clusterprofiler56,57 tool to identify enrichment of the genes in specific pathways described in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)58 and Reactome59 databases. The gene counts for groups 5–9 in Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7 ranged from 20,515 to 28,321.\n\nEstimating monoclonal antibody concentrations in serum\n\nConcentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS in macaque serum were quantified by ELISA as follows: 384-well high binding polystyrene plates (Corning 3700) were coated with 4.0 μg ml–1 of the anti-idiotype antibody 1F1 (Protein Production Facility, The Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University, NC) diluted in Dulbecco’s PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (DPBS) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The plate was washed twice with 10× diluted commercial 0.5% Tween-20 solution (BioWorld 40120769-3) and blocked with 5.0% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DPBS (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. The blocking buffer was aspirated off the plate and serum samples, serially diluted in the blocking buffer, were loaded onto the plate. Each assay contained serial dilutions of recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS to generate a standard curve. These serial dilutions were performed with blocking buffer and the first well of the series was spiked with macaque serum to a final dilution of 1:2,000. The samples and the standard curve dilutions were incubated in the plate for 1.5 h. The plate was then washed five times. Next, a (Fab) 2 fragment conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) specific for the human Fcγ domain (Jackson Immuno 109-036-008) was diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. This solution was added to the plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was washed 10 times and developed using 1-step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate solution (Thermo Fisher 34028). The reaction was stopped using Liquid Stop Solution for TMB (Surmodics LTSP-1000-01). Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a BioTek Synergy LX spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). To obtain an ELISA standard curve, the recorded absorbance values were plotted on the y axis, while the concentrations of the standard protein, namely rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS, were plotted on the x axis. Data analysis and curve fitting were performed with GraphPad Prism software, employing a four-parameter logistic or sigmoidal curve model. Subsequently, this model was used for the estimation of unknown concentrations of the analyte within the serum samples via interpolation. Interpolated values derived from the linear region typically in mid to low concentration ranges of the standard curve were utilized for further analyses. The same methodology was used to determine serum concentrations of rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS, except that plates were coated with 4.0 μg ml–1 of a mouse anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone MEM-241; Millipore Sigma SAB4700059) and serial dilutions of recombinant rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS were used to generate the standard curve of the assay.\n\nEstimation of ADA responses in serum\n\nSerum reactivity to rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS was monitored by ELISA using 384-well high binding polystyrene plates (Corning 3700). These plates were coated with a DPBS solution containing 2.0 μg ml–1 of purified recombinant rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS, which uses a κ light chain. Each plate was washed twice with 10× diluted commercial 0.5% Tween-20 solution and blocked with 5.0% (w/v) BSA in DPBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The blocking buffer was aspirated off the plate and serum samples, diluted 1:200 in the blocking buffer, were loaded onto the plate. Samples were incubated in the plate for 1.5 h. The plate was then washed five times. Next, a goat polyclonal antibody preparation specific for human IgG λ light chain and conjugated to HRP (Southern Biotech 2070-05) was diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. This solution was added to the plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was washed 10 times and developed using 1-step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate solution (Thermo Fisher 34028). The reaction was stopped using Liquid Stop Solution for TMB (Surmodics LTSP-1000-01). The same 384-well ELISA plate was used to screen all the group 5 and group 6 samples for anti-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS antibodies. A separate plate was used for groups 7–11.\n\nThe same methodology was used to measure anti-rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS antibody responses. However, because rh-eCD4-IgG2-LS does not have light chains, reactivity was assayed with detector antibodies against both κ (Southern Biotech 2060-05) and λ light chains, both diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. All serum samples from monkeys in groups 1 and 2 were tested at a fixed serum dilution of 1:20. Reactivity against each AAV-delivered molecule was plotted as background- and baseline-subtracted absorbance values measured in each assay.\n\nSHIV neutralization assay\n\nTZM-bl neutralization assays were performed as described60. In brief, rhesus serum was serially diluted, mixed with SHIV-AD8 EO Env-pseudotyped SG3.1 pseudovirus, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 for 1 h. TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Reagent Program; not authenticated) were then added to each well and the plate was incubated for an additional 48 h. DEAE dextran was added to the cell containing media before its addition to the plate, such that the final concentration in each well was 15 μg ml–1. Plates were developed using Britelite reagent (PerkinElmer 6066761) and luciferase activity, measured as total luminescence, was quantified using a Synergy LX plate reader (Agilent Technologies). Raw luminescence values were converted to ‘per cent neutralization’ using the formula [1 − (sample luminescence − background luminescence)/(virus control − background luminescence)] × 100 and plotted in GraphPad Prism software. ID 50 titres were calculated by fitting each neutralization curve with a 4-parameter logistic non-linear regression, and then interpolating 50% neutralization onto each curve. The TZM-bl cell line tested negative for Mycoplasma contamination.\n\nEstimation of serum anti-AAV antibodies\n\nELISA plates (384-well high binding polystyrene plates; Corning 3700) were coated with rAAV-8 viral particles by adding 30 µl of AAV-8, diluted to 1.55 × 1010 GC ml–1 in DPBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+, to each well. Coating was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then washed twice with a commercial wash buffer (BioWorld 40120769-3) and blocked by adding 90 µl of 5.0% Blotto (Rockland Immunochemicals B5010500) in DPBS followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was aspirated and serum samples, diluted by a factor of 200 in the same blocking buffer, were loaded onto the plate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed 5 times. A Fab fragment conjugated to HRP, specific for human Fcγ (Jackson Immuno 109-036-008) was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was then washed 10 times and developed using 1-step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate solution (Thermo Fisher 34028) and Liquid Stop Solution for TMB (Surmodics LTSP-1000-01). All samples in the study were measured on the same ELISA plate, so that valid relative comparisons could be made using raw absorbance values.\n\nStatistics\n\nKaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to determine whether the rate of SHIV-AD8 EO acquisition differed between AAV-treated and control macaques following oral or intrarectal challenges with SHIV-AD8 EO . The P values for these comparisons were calculated using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Differences between serum concentrations of rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS, anti-rh-3BNC117-IgG1-LS antibody responses (that is, ADAs) and other immune parameters were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U-test.\n\nFor comparisons of ADAs between groups, we determined the cumulative levels of these responses for each monkey. Specifically, we calculated the AUC of absorbance values measured during the 20 weeks of follow-up after the AAV vector administration. To avoid confounders related to inter-assay variability in ADA values, only absorbance values measured in the same 384-well ELISA plate were used to calculate AUC values. For these assays, the developing reagents were added to the plates within seconds using an automated 96-channel pipette in order to minimize time differences in well development.\n\nThe Spearman rank correlation method was used to search for associations between the age of monkeys at the time of AAV-bNAb vector administration and bNAb serum concentrations and the cumulative levels of anti-bNAb antibody responses measured over time. The incidence of macaques that developed persistent bNAb expression following AAV-bNAb therapy was compared between experimental or age groups using Fisher’s exact test. A significance threshold of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. All P values reported here are two-tailed.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

Finding ways to protect infants early on is vital to stopping new infections.\n\n**What happened**\nScientists gave newborn rhesus monkeys a single dose of a special harmless virus called an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that carries instructions to produce powerful HIV-blocking antibodies. These antibodies stayed in the monkeys' systems for a long time, protecting them from HIV infection in tests mimicking how humans get the virus.\n\n**Impact**\nThis study shows that just one shot right after birth can keep protective antibodies active for a long time, potentially stopping HIV before it can take hold. This is a big step toward a new way to prevent HIV in babies and young people, especially those who face higher risks.\n\n**What's next step**\nResearchers will work on making sure this method is safe and effective in humans, and explore how to best deliver it to newborns worldwide. If successful, this could become a powerful tool in the fight against HIV.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nGiving a single dose of a harmless virus carrying HIV-fighting antibodies right after birth could protect babies for a long time from HIV infection.",

      "content": "The prebiotic properties of human milk could be harnessed to treat a bacterial strain known to cause problems for immunocompromised people – and trigger premature birth\n\nStreptococcus bacteria are responsible for vaginal and urinary tract infections and newborn infections CAVALLINI JAMES/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nA type of sugar in human milk could help treat a common strain of Streptococcus bacteria, which can complicate pregnancies when it infects the vagina.\n\nHuman milk remains understudied. “This is the second most important liquid in the universe after water, and we don’t know much about it,” says Steven Townsend at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.\n\nResearchers are just beginning to unpack the properties of helpful sugars found only in this substance: human milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs. Although they were once thought to be random sugars, recent studies suggest they are extremely effective prebiotics, “kind of like personalized medicine” for newborn babies, says Townsend.\n\nPrevious studies on HMOs have focused on how they might benefit the gut microbiome. Townsend and his team decided to instead study their effect on the vagina. They wanted to better understand how HMOs may help regulate the proportion of healthy bacteria and potentially dangerous Group B Streptococcus, or GBS.\n\n“Group B Strep is a bacteria that all of us have,” says Townsend. “It typically is going to cause us no harm, and we’re not even going to know we have it.” However, GBS can cause disease in immunocompromised people, including pregnant women and newborn babies. During pregnancy, GBS in the vagina can cause a variety of problems, like preterm birth. For this reason, pregnant people with vaginal GBS infections are typically treated with antibiotics.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Health Check Expert insight and news on scientific developments in health, nutrition and fitness, every Saturday. Sign up to newsletter\n\nTownsend and his team tracked the growth of GBS and healthy Lactobacillus bacteria in the presence of HMOs. They studied three different scenarios: the bacteria and sugars on their own, on lab-engineered vaginal tissue and in living mice. In all three cases, HMOs promoted the growth of healthy bacteria, which outcompeted the GBS.\n\nThe result is likely due to a “nice little storm of positive effects”, says Townsend. He explains GBS cannot grow in an environment with HMOs, whereas the healthy bacteria can eat HMOs and grow prolifically, further stifling the growth of GBS. On top of this, as the healthy bacteria consume the HMOs, they produce fatty acids that make the whole environment more acidic, killing even more harmful bacteria.\n\nThe finding suggests more ways to potentially regulate and restore a healthy vaginal microbiome. “Anything that points to new tools or methods to do that is of high therapeutic value for women and their newborns,” says Katy Patras at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. However, she says a potential therapy is still several steps down the road.\n\nEven when a useable therapy becomes available, the researchers say the best course of action to treat a GBS infection is still to take antibiotics. “What we’re doing is not to replace antibiotics,” says Townsend. “We’re doing this research to try to save antibiotics”, because overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibacterial resistance that renders the drugs ineffective. A novel therapy using HMOs to regulate the microbiome could be used in tandem, reducing the amount of antibiotics required to treat GBS.\n\n“I think those synergistic interactions could be extremely useful,” says Lars Bode at the University of California, San Diego. However, he cautions, people should stay tuned for further developments rather than trying to engage with human milk therapy at this preliminary research stage. Doing so could actually create even more problems, as untreated milk can carry infectious diseases like HIV, he says.\n\nIn the meantime, Townsend wants to better understand the unique evolutionary tools humans are equipped with in HMOs.\n\n“It’s absolutely mind-boggling how we’ve completely understudied and underestimated the power of human milk,” says Bode.",

These infections can be particularly dangerous for people with weakened immune systems and may lead to premature births.\n\n**What happened**\nResearchers discovered that a special sugar found in human milk has prebiotic properties, meaning it helps good bacteria grow and keeps harmful bacteria in check. This sugar could be used to treat the harmful Streptococcus strain, offering a natural way to fight these infections.\n\n**Impact**\nUsing this sugar from human milk as a treatment could reduce infections that complicate pregnancies, helping protect both mothers and babies. It also provides hope for people with weaker immune systems, improving their health and reducing the chances of early births.\n\n**What's next step**\nScientists plan to study how to best use this sugar in treatments, ensuring it works safely and effectively. They will also explore how it could be made widely available for pregnant women and others at risk.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nA natural sugar in human milk could become a powerful tool to protect pregnant women from harmful infections and promote healthier pregnancies.",

      "content": "New tests to gauge an individual's circadian rhythms could be put to good use helping night workers fend off the ill effects of their unsocial hours\n\nGorodenkoff/Getty Images\n\nThe graveyard shift is aptly named. People who work at night have an elevated risk of health problems including heart attacks, type 2 diabetes and depression. So greatly increased is their chance of getting cancer that the World Health Organization has declared shift work a probable carcinogen.\n\nToiling while the rest of us slumber, these workers often go unseen, though their labour underpins medical and emergency services on which we all depend. We may rely on them as a matter of life and death, yet the impact of their hours on their own health is an ironic and unfortunate inevitability.\n\nThat could be set to change with the development of tests that can finally discern the timings of someone’s internal body clock as it relates to the ticking of external time (see “How revolutionary new tests can unlock the power of your body clock”). This promises to unlock a powerful new force in medicine in a way that helps many more people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe already know that a lot of the most commonly taken drugs affect body systems that work on a 24-hour rhythm and are more effective if taken in sync with it. Surgery and vaccines, too, work better at certain times of the day. Early efforts to accommodate this are based on a standard biological clock. But for those whose body time is out of whack, this can not only be ineffective, but also harmful. Which is where the new tests come in.\n\nNight workers often go unseen, but they underpin services on which we all depend\n\nThe good news is they are set to become cheaper and more widely available. The bad news is they could end up just being used by the worried well seeking to optimise their health, using them alongside other metrics such as step count (see page 16).\n\nBut the real potential will be using them to give a window into the inner workings of those whose body clocks are seriously disrupted, offering them better treatment for the effects of working at night, more intelligent tools to manage their shift patterns and, one day, to ensure they get medical treatment at times that work with the clock their body is ticking to.\n\nThis offers a real chance to alleviate the health burden of night work and give such staff a new lease of life. Employers must wake up to this opportunity.",
