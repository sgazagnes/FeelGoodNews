      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn a major triumph for marine conservation, more than 185 countries agreed to bolster protections for 70 species of endangered sharks and rays. The announcement came during the 20th conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. The new regulations target the unsustainable fishing industry that is driving population declines, and are set to take effect within the next three to 18 months.\n\nThe expanded protections mark a significant step toward reversing decades of neglect. Unlike whales and turtles, which gained international safeguards over 40 years ago, sharks and rays have only recently begun receiving the same level of attention. As a result, many species have seen steep drops thanks to overfishing and the global demand for their fins, liver oil, and gill plates.\n\nThe threats behind the decline\n\nEach of the 70 species added or reclassified under CITES has been targeted for specific reasons. Wedgefish and similar guitarfish are commonly harvested for shark fin soup, a delicacy that continues to drive illegal and unsustainable fishing. Gulper sharks are hunted for their liver oil, a substance used in moisturizers and antioxidant supplements. Rays are also under pressure, as their gill plates are used in traditional medicine across parts of Asia.\n\nExperts emphasize that these species are particularly vulnerable due to biological traits such as slow growth rates and late maturity, which make population recovery even more difficult.\n\nWhat the new CITES protections mean\n\nRather than banning all trade, the CITES treaty focuses on strengthening regulations to ensure that international trade in shark and ray products is both legal and sustainable. Species are categorized under different levels of protection through a tiered system of appendices:\n\nAppendix I includes species that are endangered and bans all commercial international trade. Recent additions to this category include whale sharks, oceanic white tip sharks, and manta rays.\n\nAppendix II includes species that are not necessarily endangered but are at risk if trade is not regulated. This now covers gulper sharks, smooth-hound sharks, and guitarfish.\n\nThe updated listings require countries to verify the origin of traded products and prove they come from populations that are not being harmed by commercial exploitation.\n\nA pivotal moment for ocean health\n\nConservationists and scientists view the decision as a watershed moment for ocean conservation. Sharks and rays are keystone species; they help maintain balance in marine ecosystems by regulating prey populations and supporting biodiversity. Their decline can set off chain reactions throughout ocean food webs, with long-term consequences for fisheries and coastal communities alike.\n\nAlthough challenges such as such as monitoring and tracking trade routes remain in enforcing the new regulations, marine experts say this agreement is a major leap forward. The hope is that with global cooperation and improved transparency, some of the world’s most threatened marine animals will have a better chance at survival.\n\nDid this solution stand out?

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – More than 185 countries gathered at the 20th conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, to address the decline of endangered marine animals.\n\n**What happened** – These countries agreed to increase protections for 70 species of sharks and rays that have been threatened by overfishing. The new rules will start within three to 18 months and focus on regulating trade to make sure it is legal and sustainable, rather than banning it completely.\n\n**Impact** – This is an important step because sharks and rays have only recently received international protection, unlike whales and turtles. Many species have been overfished for their fins, liver oil, and gill plates, which are used in foods, cosmetics, and traditional medicine. Protecting these animals helps keep ocean ecosystems balanced since sharks and rays control other marine populations.\n\n**What's next step** – Countries will now work to enforce these new trade rules by checking that shark and ray products come from safe populations. Experts hope this global effort will improve the survival chances of these vulnerable species and support healthier oceans.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Over 185 countries have agreed to stronger rules protecting 70 endangered sharks and rays, marking a major global effort to save these important ocean species.",

      "title": "Recycling Mystery: Silicone Products",
      "summary": "Silicone is now found in many homes, but recycling it can be tricky. It’s used...\nThe post Recycling Mystery: Silicone Products appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "Silicone is now found in many homes, but recycling it can be tricky. It’s used in everything from food storage bags and baking mats to baby bottle nipples, kitchen tools, and medical devices. Its durability helps reduce single-use plastics, but when these items wear out, finding a way to recycle them isn’t always easy.\n\nIf you still have colored silicone wristbands from the charity bracelet craze of the 2000s, you’re in good company. Those gel bracelets that once signified support for causes ranging from cancer research to disaster relief are now often tucked away in drawers, waiting for a proper disposal solution.\n\nHowever, there are now more ways to recycle silicone. Here’s how you can keep your old Livestrong bands and other silicone items out of the landfill.\n\nWhat Makes Silicone Difficult to Recycle?\n\nSilicone shares some traits with plastic, but it’s actually a type of rubber made in a different way. To make silicone, manufacturers extract silicon from quartz, then combine it with fossil-fuel hydrocarbons to form a strong polymer. This makes silicone almost indestructible, so it doesn’t break down or decompose. Even though silicone can be recycled, you can’t just put it in your regular recycling bin, even if your service accepts many types of plastic.\n\nThe global silicone market is now worth about $22 billion as of 2024, with around 3.6 million metric tons produced each year. As silicone products become more common, finding ways for consumers to recycle them is becoming more important.\n\nFortunately, more options for recycling silicone are now available to consumers.\n\nMail-In Recycling Programs\n\nOne of the simplest ways to recycle silicone is through mail-in programs. Several companies now accept silicone products for recycling:\n\nGoSili (Any Food-Grade Silicone Brand)\n\nGoSili offers a free recycling program that accepts silicone products from any brand. They take items like silicone cups, lids, straws, kitchen tools, and other food-grade silicone products. The main rule is that items must be 100% silicone, so you’ll need to remove any non-silicone parts before sending them in.\n\nTo participate, ship clean silicone items to:\n\nXpert Fulfillment\n\nAttn: GoSili Recycling\n\n2532 Benzie Hwy\n\nBenzonia, MI 49616\n\nAfter you ship your items, email your tracking number to service@gosili.com to get a discount code for your next GoSili purchase.\n\nPlease note: GoSili does not accept adult toys, medical devices that have touched biohazardous fluids, or items made with plastic, metal, or fabric parts.\n\nStasher Bags\n\nStasher works with TerraCycle to provide free recycling for its silicone storage bags. When your Stasher bag is worn out, you can send it in to be recycled into materials for playground surfaces and other products. This program only accepts Stasher brand bags.\n\nZiploc Endurables\n\nYou can recycle Ziploc’s Endurables silicone pouches and containers through TerraCycle’s free program. First, create a TerraCycle account, then gather your empty Endurables, request a shipping label, and mail them in. You’ll earn TerraCycle points, which you can donate to schools and nonprofits.\n\nPura Stainless\n\nPura accepts silicone parts from their own bottles and accessories. Just clean the silicone items and ship them to Pura by any shipping method. They work with ECO USA to recycle the material.\n\nSimple Ecology\n\nSimple Ecology recycles its own silicone products, like Silicopat baking mats and Capflex lids. If your Simple Ecology silicone item is damaged, contact them at info@simpleecology.com to set up recycling. This program is only for Simple Ecology products.\n\nSilicone Recycling: An Industry On The Rise\n\nIt’s often hard to collect enough material to make recycling profitable. But as silicone use grows, the recycling industry is expanding too. In 2018, ECO USA opened the first large-scale silicone recycling plant in the U.S., located in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The plant processes over 8,000 metric tons of silicone each year, breaking it down into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an oil used to make new products.\n\nECO USA’s process creates material with a carbon footprint that is 76-78% lower than new silicone. Most of their material comes from manufacturers’ post-industrial waste, but they also partner with brands like Pura to offer take-back programs for consumers.\n\nIn late 2024, Dow and Circusil LLC opened a commercial silicone recycling facility in Paris, Kentucky. Although this plant mainly handles industrial waste, it shows that more companies are investing in silicone recycling.\n\nA study published in Science in April 2025 described a new recycling process that can turn almost any silicone polymer back into chlorosilanes, which are used to make new silicone. This process could allow silicone to be recycled over and over, with quality as good as new material. As these technologies move from the lab to real-world use, consumers may soon have more ways to recycle silicone.\n\nWhat About Those Wristbands?\n\nThe height of the silicone bracelet trend was in 2004, when the Livestrong Foundation sold 21 million yellow wristbands in one year. After Lance Armstrong’s doping scandal in 2012, the charity had to figure out what to do with over 100,000 unwanted wristbands. They considered grinding them up to make playground surfaces, but the foundation never made its solution public.\n\nIf you want to get rid of old charity wristbands, GoSili’s take-back program is your best option right now. Remember, the wristbands must be made entirely of silicone, with no plastic inserts or metal parts.\n\nReuse Ideas\n\nSince recycling options are still limited for some silicone products, finding creative ways to reuse them can help them last longer:\n\nKitchen helper : Wrap a silicone wristband around a stubborn jar lid for a better grip\n\n: Wrap a silicone wristband around a stubborn jar lid for a better grip Cable management : Use silicone bands to gather loose cords and cables\n\n: Use silicone bands to gather loose cords and cables Garden ties : Secure small trees to posts or bundle plant stems\n\n: Secure small trees to posts or bundle plant stems Temporary repairs: Use as gaskets or to seal minor leaks in hoses\n\nIf your silicone baking mats or kitchen tools are damaged, you can still use them as potholders or trivets, even if they’re not safe for food anymore.\n\nSilicone recycling has improved a lot since these products first became common in homes. While you still can’t recycle silicone at the curb, more companies and specialty recyclers now offer ways to dispose of it responsibly. When buying new silicone products, look for brands that offer recycling programs at the end of the product’s life. This helps close the loop on this useful material.\n\nEditor’s Note: First published in 2018, this article was most recently updated in January 2026.",

      "content": "When you need a new laptop, phone, or TV, think about buying refurbished. It used to seem risky, but now there are trusted marketplaces with certified, warrantied products that work like new, often for 30% to 70% less than retail.\n\nThe refurbished electronics market has grown into a $62 billion global industry in 2025, according to market research firm Coherent Market Insights, and it is projected to reach $122 billion by 2032. That growth reflects a fundamental shift in how consumers think about technology: not as disposable gadgets, but as durable goods worth maintaining, repairing, and reusing.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links. If you make a purchase through these links we will receive a small commission from the sale that helps fund our work.\n\nThe Case for Refurbished Electronics\n\nThe need to protect the environment is more urgent than ever. The United Nations’ Global E-waste Monitor 2024 reports that the world produced 62 million tons of electronic waste in 2024, up 82% since 2010. Only 22.3% was recycled properly. E-waste is growing five times faster than recycling systems can keep up, and by 2030, 82 million tons of electronics will need to be reused or recycled each year.\n\nJames Murdock, who started Alchemy Global Solutions, talked about the benefits of the circular economy on Earth911’s Sustainability In Your Ear podcast. His company has refurbished and resold over 12 million devices, keeping them out of landfills and giving them new life. He noted that most people keep their smartphones for about two and a half years, even though manufacturers say they can last six to eight years. This means millions of working phones are thrown away too soon.\n\nBuying refurbished also makes financial sense. In 2024, refurbished smartphones accounted for over 25% of global secondary-market sales, as people sought options beyond expensive new models. A Deloitte survey found that 48% of buyers choose electronics based on affordability, which makes refurbished products more appealing\n\nAny stigma around refurbished tech is fading fast, particularly among younger consumers. According to Statista Consumer Insights, 47% of Gen Z consumers prefer refurbished or secondhand tech to reduce e-waste, compared to just 18% of Baby Boomers and 25% of Gen X. Business is also choosing refurbished laptops and servers to manage costs and reduce their environmental footprint.\n\nWhat Refurbished Really Means\n\nNot all refurbished products are created equal. Here’s the terminology you need to know:\n\nCertified Refurbished/Manufacturer Refurbished: Products restored by the original manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, Dell) or authorized partners. These devices undergo rigorous testing, use genuine parts, and typically include full warranties.\n\nSeller Refurbished: These are restored by third-party professionals. Quality can differ, so choose sellers with good ratings, clear grading, and solid warranties.\n\nRenewed: This usually means the product was barely used and only needed checking before resale, with little or no repair. Amazon Renewed, for example, offers iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices.\n\nOpen-Box: These items have been opened or lightly used and usually just need a cosmetic check. They often offer the best value.\n\nUsed/Pre-Owned: Sold as-is, without major repairs or certification. The buyer takes on more risk.\n\nPractical Tips for Buying Refurbished\n\nDo Your Homework on the Seller\n\nWhen buying refurbished, choosing the right seller matters most. Look for certified programs from manufacturers or trusted marketplaces with good customer feedback. Check ratings, read reviews about refurbished items, and find out how the product was certified.\n\nUnderstand the Grading System\n\nMost refurbished sellers use grades like Excellent, Good, and Fair, which usually describe how the device looks. All grades should work the same. An ‘Excellent’ device looks almost new, while a ‘Fair’ one may have scratches but still works just as well. Decide if you care more about looks or saving money.\n\nPrioritize Warranty Coverage\n\nA good warranty is essential. Apple’s certified refurbished products come with a full one-year warranty. Back Market gives at least 12 months on all items. Amazon Renewed offers a 90-day guarantee, or one year for Renewed Premium. If a seller doesn’t give at least 30 days of coverage, shop somewhere else.\n\nCheck Battery Health\n\nFor phones, laptops, and tablets, battery health is key. Good refurbishers replace batteries or make sure they hold at least 80% of their original charge. Ask about the battery before you buy, and check it as soon as you get the device.\n\nVerify Device History for Phones\n\nWhen buying a refurbished phone, make sure the IMEI number is not blacklisted. A blacklisted phone may have been reported stolen or have unpaid bills, which can block it from working on networks. Trusted sellers like Swappa check IMEI status for you. Also, check if the phone is unlocked or, if it’s locked, that it works with your carrier.\n\nConsider Timing\n\nThe refurbished market changes with new product releases. Shortly after Apple launches a new iPhone, the previous generation models become available at lower prices as trade-ins flood the market. After the holidays, there are also more choices as returned items are resold.\n\nWhere to Shop for Refurbished Tech\n\nManufacturer Programs\n\nFor the highest quality assurance, buy directly from manufacturers. Apple Certified Refurbished offers devices with new batteries, full one-year warranties, and genuine parts. Samsung Certified Re-Newed provides factory-restored Galaxy devices with full inspections and warranties.\n\nDell Outlet and Microsoft run similar programs for their computers and devices.\n\nDedicated Refurbished Marketplaces\n\nBack Market is now Europe’s top refurbished marketplace and is growing fast in North America. It connects buyers with over 1,500 trusted refurbishers, uses standard quality grades, and offers at least a 12-month warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee. Its user base has grown by almost 40% as more people look for affordable alternatives to new devices.\n\nGazelle focuses on phones and uses a detailed 30-point inspection. It has joined with Back Market, combining their strengths in refurbishment and marketplace access. Devices come with a 30-day return period and different warranty options.\n\nMajor Retailers\n\nAmazon Renewed combines Amazon’s fast delivery with certified pre-owned products. Sellers must meet strict quality standards, like keeping an Order Defect Rate below 0.8%. Products come with a 90-day satisfaction guarantee. In early 2025, Amazon Renewed reported a 25% increase in refurbished device sales compared to the previous year.\n\nBest Buy has recycled electronics since 2007 and sells certified refurbished products in its outlet section. They offer Geek Squad support, let you inspect items in-store before buying, and have good return policies. You can find phones, laptops, TVs, and audio equipment there.\n\nStaples has recycling and trade-in programs, plus a wide range of refurbished computers and accessories.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Marketplaces\n\nSwappa is a peer-to-peer marketplace where users must verify phone IMEI numbers and check for blacklist status. Payments go through PayPal for buyer protection. It’s a bit riskier than certified programs, but prices are often lower since there’s no middleman.\n\neBay Certified Refurbished has a wide range of products, like phones, computers, TVs, and robot vacuums, from sellers approved by manufacturers who must offer at least a two-year warranty. For non-certified listings, use filters to find trusted sellers with high ratings and look for items marked ‘refurbished’ or ‘manufacturer certified.’\n\nAudio Equipment Specialists\n\nFor high-end audio equipment, specialty dealers provide expert advice and quality assurance. World Wide Stereo sells certified pre-owned and factory-refurbished A/V gear with manufacturer warranties. TMRAudio tests and certifies pre-owned audio with a Happiness Guarantee. SkyFi Audio focuses on vintage and high-end audio, thoroughly tested by skilled technicians.\n\nBeyond Smartphones: What Else to Buy Refurbished\n\nSmartphones make up 46.4% of the refurbished market, but other types of electronics can also be great deals:\n\nLaptops: This is the fastest-growing segment, especially for schools and businesses. For the best mix of performance and value, choose models from the last two or three years.\n\nTablets: iPads in particular keep working well for years. A refurbished iPad Pro can cost half as much as a new one and work just as well.\n\nTVs: Open-box and refurbished TVs from Best Buy and other stores can save you a lot of money. Since TVs usually stay in one place, small scratches or marks are less important.\n\nGaming Consoles: You can often find refurbished PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch consoles, usually from GameStop or directly from the manufacturers.\n\nAudio Equipment: Speakers, receivers, and headphones can last for decades if cared for. High-end audio gear especially keeps its value and works well when refurbished.\n\nWhen Electronics Become Unusable, Recycle\n\nNot every device can be reused. When electronics are truly at the end of their life, it’s important to recycle them properly. EPEAT says that 40% of heavy metals in landfills come from electronics. For example, you can get one gram of gold from just 41 cell phones, the same as mining a ton of ore.\n\nEarth911’s guides to recycling small electronics and computers detail how to find certified recyclers. Look for R2 or e-Stewards certifications to ensure electronics are processed responsibly. Major retailers like Best Buy and Staples accept electronics for recycling at no charge, and manufacturer programs like Dell Reconnect (through participating Goodwill locations) make proper disposal convenient.\n\nMake Your Future Circular\n\nBuying refurbished technology means rethinking how we view our devices. It’s a smart way to step off the constant upgrade cycle. Like the used car market, which now makes up 74% of car sales, refurbished electronics are becoming a popular choice for people who know that quality doesn’t always mean buying new.",

      "summary": "Between 1970 and 2020, the country experienced at least 40 major climate shocks, with drought affecting around 400,000 people each year and reducing crop revenues by US$9.5 million annually, according to the World Bank.",
      "content": "This article by Tara Abhasakun was originally published by Peace News Network on January 13, 2026. An edited version is republished on Global Voices as part of a content partnership agreement.\n\nMali is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change. Between 1970 and 2020, the country experienced at least 40 major climate shocks, with drought affecting around 400,000 people each year and reducing crop revenue by USD 9.5 million annually, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn Mali, climate change is a major factor in conflict, according to an August 2025 report by the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG). Due to the degradation of grazing lands from declining soil fertility, the report says, farmers are expanding their cultivation into traditional herding routes. This has led to violent conflicts between farmers and herders.\n\nIn order to recruit more members, violent extremist groups have exploited these tensions, taking advantage of ethnic and religious differences and land rights disputes. Young people are particularly vulnerable to falling prey to extremist groups in this context.\n\nThe climate crisis is also a factor in this region and often disproportionately impacts women, who are crucial to farming and household survival, by forcing them to travel farther for fuelwood and water. Escalating conflicts are putting women at increased risk of gender-based violence.\n\nThe UNSDG provides examples of some projects that have shown success in building resilience to climate change and reducing conflict. It also, along with other organizations, recommends several further steps for the Malian government and international partners to take to resolve the climate conflict and build peace in Mali.\n\nThe UNSDG notes that local authorities and communities can improve early warning systems, providing advanced information about approaching hazards such as droughts and floods. This, the UNSDG says, has helped by allowing people to evacuate to safer places and letting farmers take steps to protect their crops.\n\nTraining programs combining science with traditional knowledge is improving the situation. These training programs focus on assisted natural regeneration and land and water management and are helping farmers and pastoralists adapt to changing climatic conditions, according to UNSDG reports.\n\nAnother solution is reviving traditional laws for environmental sustainability. Salif Aly Guindo, president of Barahogon, a traditional institution of the Dogon ethnic group, said the group has re-established traditional laws for sustainable use of forests. Since then, she said, “trees and forests have begun to regenerate, reducing conflicts and floods.” Now, people in towns like Djénné and Mopti are following the group’s model, she added.\n\nMaliki Hamadoun Sankaré, a young Malian entrepreneur who launched Socco-Agro-Business to boost local rice and vegetable production, is working to provide young people with jobs. He said, “We want to create several jobs in the agricultural sector by 2030, especially for the youth in rural areas, to reduce rural exodus.”\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) recommends in a 2023 report, “long-term development strategies on issues where the impact of climate change entails conflict risks: livelihood security, herder-farmer relations, resource disputes, community conflict, governance, social marginalisation and exclusion.”\n\nSIPRI encourages the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) to work with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to appoint an Environmental Security Advisor for prioritising climate, peace, and security risks within MINUSMA, as well as for “coordinating effective responses with the rest of the UN system, the Malian government, civil society, international and regional partners.”\n\nAnother suggestion for the Malian government by SIPRI is to strengthen the leadership and participation of women and girls in decision-making on conflict-sensitive resource management, climate adaptation, and responses to climate, peace, and security risks.\n\nFinally, SIPRI recommends that the Malian government and its partners, which include the African Union (AU), European Union (EU), and United Nations (UN), agree on a climate-sensitive stabilisation strategy. This strategy, SIPRI says, should combine security and attention to development needs, governance reforms, and political dialogues, to tackle the causes of conflict in Mali’s ten regions and in transboundary areas like the Liptako-Gourma. This includes causes affected by climate change.\n\nMeanwhile, further research is continuing. According to a March 2025 report by the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), Malian stakeholders recommend “designing programs that enhance the ability of local communities to cope with climate impacts and security threats.” These research-based recommendations, the report says, are expected to guide a technical committee in developing Mali’s first national climate security strategy.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Mali has faced many climate problems like droughts for decades. These problems have hurt farmers and caused conflicts between different groups, making life harder for many people.\n\n**What happened** – New reports show that climate change is causing fights between farmers and herders because land is becoming less fertile. Violent groups have taken advantage of this tension to recruit young people. But local communities and organizations are working together to solve these problems. They use early warnings for droughts, teach new farming methods, and bring back old rules to protect forests. Young entrepreneurs are also creating jobs to keep people working on the land.\n\n**Impact** – These efforts are helping reduce fights and protect the environment. For example, restoring traditional laws has helped forests grow back and lowered conflicts and floods. Training farmers and herders to adapt to climate change is making their work safer and more successful. These changes also help women, who often face extra hardships during droughts and conflicts.\n\n**What's next step** – Experts suggest that Mali should have a clear plan that links climate action with peace and security. This includes involving women more in decision-making and working closely with international groups like the United Nations and African Union. Research will continue to guide these plans, aiming to create Mali’s first national climate security strategy.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Mali is using local knowledge, new ideas, and teamwork to fight climate change’s effects and build a more peaceful future for its people.",
