This meeting brought together many countries to discuss important social issues like poverty, discrimination, and access to basic services.\n\n**What happened** – At the summit, dozens of governments agreed on the Doha Political Declaration. This document promises to work harder to reduce poverty, create good jobs, fight discrimination, and improve social security and human rights. They also highlighted the need to protect rights to housing, food, health, education, water, and sanitation. Next week, talks will continue in Nairobi on a new UN tax agreement. This plan aims to create fairer tax rules to stop companies and wealthy people from avoiding taxes.\n\n**Impact** – This agreement is important because it could raise hundreds of billions of dollars for countries. That money can help pay for schools, healthcare, and social programs, especially in places that struggle to fund these services. The declaration also stresses that social progress depends on peace, security, and respect for all human rights. These commitments come at a time when young people in countries like Morocco are demanding fair economic opportunities and better public services.\n\n**What's next step** – The tax negotiations in Nairobi will continue and are expected to finish by 2027.

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nLanguage, Identity & Belonging\n\nWelcome to the second week of The Optimist Daily’s Annual Local Changemakers series. This week, we celebrate those bridging communication gaps and fighting for inclusion. Join us as we learn all about changemakers whose work speaks volumes and strives to catch the attention of a world that often forgets to listen. From linguistic equity to educational access, their compassion creates ripples of empowerment.\n\nToday, we shine a light on Celena Ponce, a woman whose heart and hands are shaping a more just, inclusive world for Deaf immigrants and their families.\n\nHow Celena Ponce is empowering Deaf immigrant families\n\nThe impactful work of Celena Ponce began as a loving relationship between her and her goddaughter, a young Deaf Latina woman struggling to navigate an unfamiliar world. Starting Hands United, or Manos Unidas in Spanish, wasn’t just a career move; it was born out of love and compassion.\n\nNow, the nonprofit now supports Deaf and hard-of-hearing children of immigrant families across 30 states. From ASL education to legal consultation support, Celena and her team are bridging the gap for families that are too often left out of the conversation.\n\n“We’ve now supported around 300 families in 30 states,” Celena shared. “And we’re currently working with six Deaf immigrants—helping either through consultation with their legal team or by connecting them to the right support.”\n\nIt’s a small but mighty operation that offers classes, workshops, visual communication tools, multilingual ASL dictionaries, and legal navigation help, all for free. The nonprofit’s dedication extends to creating communication boards for immigration and detention contexts, allowing Deaf individuals to better advocate for themselves when it matters most.\n\nHands United doesn’t just mitigate the impact of language deprivation. It reaches over layers of exclusion and makes a path for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community to live with dignity.\n\nMore than services: stories of trust and transformation\n\nThe weight of Hands United’s work can’t be measured solely in numbers. It’s in the relief of a parent who can finally communicate with their child. The empowerment of a Deaf immigrant who, for the first time, feels heard in court. The joy of a child signing “I love you” to their mom in their shared language.\n\nThe organization is trusted not only by the families it serves, but also by major supporters in the Deaf community. The American Society for Deaf Children (ASDC) has publicly championed Hands United for its groundbreaking work with underserved Deaf youth and immigrant communities.\n\n“ASDC supports Hands United’s mission of bridging communication gaps for Deaf children in immigrant families,” the organization shared. “Their commitment to equity and education reflects the future we all want to build.”\n\nEquity, heart, and a vision for more\n\nHands United remains free for all families, thanks to a community-powered model built on collaboration and compassion. Their bilingual website, handsunitedor.org, is filled with resources, from sign language guides to updates about workshops and events. The nonprofit’s presence is also active on Facebook, where their team shares real-time support updates and multilingual advocacy.\n\nWhile their reach already spans 30 states, Celena envisions scaling further to meet families wherever they are, in every sense of the word.\n\nFrom us to them: A standing ovation\n\nThis kind of change takes hands and hearts. As part of this feature, we also honor the families who have trusted Hands United, the educators who partner in solidarity, and the Deaf community leaders who uplift one another in the pursuit of a more inclusive world.\n\nCelena, thank you for showing us what it looks like to listen deeply, teach boldly, and love in every language.\n\nLearn more about Hands United and how you can support their work: https://handsunitedor.org/\n\nFollow them on Instagram and YouTube for the latest updates.",

      "summary": "President Roberta Metsola was in Chișinău to address the Parliament at the start of its legislative term, where she reiterated Parliament's commitment to Moldova's European future. Source : © European Union, 2025 - EP",
      "content": "Stimate domnule Președinte,\n\nStimați membri ai Parlamentului Republicii Moldova,\n\nDragi europeni,\n\n\n\nÎn primul meu an în fruntea Parlamentului European, am venit în această sală de plen, exact în acest loc, și am spus: locul Moldovei este în Europa. Este o onoare să mă întorc aici, în acest nou mandat de Președintă a Parlamentului European, nu doar pentru a repeta acest mesaj, ci pentru a-l reînnoi.\n\n\n\nIf three years ago, we spoke of candidate status as a beginning, today I am here to speak about accession as a project. The European promise is no longer a distant idea on the horizon. We have, at this moment, a powerful window of opportunity - and there is momentum. For Moldova and its people, it is taking shape. It is real, and it is happening now. This is thanks to your country’s courage, the determination of your leaders and the conviction of your people. Thank you for this.\n\n\n\nDear friends, the significance of this day - November 7th - is not lost on us. Thirty-six years ago, just two days before the fall of the Berlin Wall, a small group of Moldovans - most of them young people - stood with candles in front of Soviet tanks. The old order’s show of might no longer spoke for them. They knew they had the right to choose their own destiny - and through a quiet but courageous act of defiance, they stepped up to claim it.\n\n\n\nIt's that same courage that still defines Moldova today. And so, I cannot begin without acknowledging the historic results of your parliamentary elections in September. For the third consecutive time, Moldova chose European path. And now you have a right - and a responsibility - to see this through. And I am here to say that we will be with you, as your friends, every step of the way.\n\n\n\nYour progress is already remarkable. And the annual Enlargement Package that was published three days ago confirms precisely this. You’ve successfully completed the screening process; you’ve adopted key roadmaps to strengthen the rule of law and democratic institutions; you’ve met the conditions to open the most crucial accession negotiation clusters; and you’re well on your way to open all clusters before the end of the year. Even as disinformation, hybrid threats, and malicious attempts sought to destabilise the country, Moldova is advancing decisively on its accession path.\n\n\n\nMr Speaker, starting this new Parliament’s work with a session on accession sends a powerful message. In your inaugural address you called this Parliament “The European Integration Generation”, and we can see it. With President Maia Sandu’s strong leadership and the Moldovan government’s steadfast commitment to joining the European Union by 2030, you are defining a generation that will bring Moldova home to Europe.\n\n\n\nIt's an ambition that runs deeper than aligning laws or harmonising standards. You understand, perhaps better than anyone, what it means to be tested - and to stand firm when it matters most. You are the people that personify the hope of Europe.\n\n\n\nIt took real courage for you to cut dependence on Russian energy. In just a few short years, you have shown what it means to choose freedom over fear, resilience over reliance, Europe over coercion. You have proven that even when the pressure mounts, a nation can stand firm.\n\n\n\nI am aware that taking a clear pro-European stance has not been easy for your country. It has come at a high cost - and the situation, I know, remains fragile. But choosing Europe has always meant choosing solidarity. Across our Union, Member States have already facilitated new interconnections. Together we are diversifying our energy supplies with partners that we can all trust.\n\n\n\nThis is as much in support for your country as it is a collective investment. The European Parliament was the first to call for an end to Russian energy dependence and now we are doing just that. Our decision and our direction are the same. Moldova’s future is European. And that means you will not face this journey, no matter how difficult it is, alone. You have my commitment on that.\n\n\n\nSo, if I have not been clear enough already, let me say: The European Parliament will do everything necessary to stand with you on your path towards becoming European Union Members.\n\n\n\nNot only political - though that matters. We were the first EU Institution to call for Moldova’s candidate status. We repeatedly condemn all foreign interference that seeks to undermine your national stability. And we remain unwavering in our support for the Republic of Moldova’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.\n\n\n\nNot only financially - though that also matters. We’ve just disbursed 18.9 million Euro under our Reform and Growth Facility which follows the 270 million Euro in pre-financing. We’ve revised the EU-Moldova Free Trade Area to ensure long-term stability and to deepen your country’s integration in the Single Market. And we’ve supported Moldova’s entry into the Single Euro Payments and the ‘Roam like at home’ areas - so that young people in Moldova have the same access to opportunities - the same chance to reach their potential - as everyone else throughout Europe.\n\n\n\nBut what I am talking about is more practical support. Having been involved in my own country’s accession process, I know from experience, how important it is to have partners that are present and that are engaged. That offer hands-on support throughout the whole process.\n\n\n\nThat is why I am proud to announce that we are officially opening a Permanent Representation Office of the European Parliament in Chișinău - a clear sign of our commitment to the Eastern Partnership countries and Moldova’s journey towards EU membership. With this office, we’ll be here on the ground every day - working alongside you, supporting you, and helping you keep up the momentum.\n\n\n\nAnd Mr Speaker, Members of Parliament, in a few moments I would be very much honoured to present you with a copy of this historic Decision as a lasting reminder of the moment we took our partnership to the next level. Promise made, promise delivered.\n\n\n\nDear friends, I know what European Union membership can mean for a country and its people. How it can lift up communities and bring concrete benefits that change lives dramatically. I want to be emphatic when I say that this is not a gesture of generosity, it is a process that benefits everyone involved. It is a win-win for all.\n\n\n\nWe’re having very serious discussions about security and defence in Europe - about what it takes to keep our people safe. But the truth is: enlargement is, was, and remains, our strongest geopolitical tool. And especially in today’s strategic reality, an enlarged European Union that is based on clear objectives, criteria and merit, is the best investment in peace, security, stability and prosperity on the European continent. Europe needs Moldova just as Moldova needs Europe.\n\n\n\nAnd to be clear, this not just my view - it is what people are saying across our continent. A recent European Union survey shows a strong majority of citizens support opening the European project to new members. The percentage is even higher among young people. People don’t just want to bring Europe to Moldova. They want to bring Moldova to Europe.\n\n\n\nJust a couple of months ago, European leaders Friedrich Merz, Emmanuel Macron and Donald Tusk gathered here in Chișinău to reaffirm our unwavering support for Moldova’s European future. It was the most powerful display of unity that showed Europe’s door is wide open. Now we need to make sure that you can step through. Destiny is calling and together we must answer.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, when talking about Moldova’s path towards EU membership, President Sandu said: “If this is a marathon, it must have a finish line - not moving goalposts”. And she’s right. Time and again, Moldova and its people have shown outstanding commitment, but every commitment needs purpose. It is Europe’s turn to respond - with the same clarity, the same courage, and the same belief in our shared future. The time has come to open accession negotiations.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, we also need to be thinking about how this will change the way we operate. What works for a Union of 27 will not work for a Union of 29, for 30 or more. So while candidate countries prepare to join, we must be using this time to prepare as well. The European Parliament is not afraid to have this discussion - just last month we voted on a report to kick-start the process. Because we know we need to keep matching our commitment with action.\n\n\n\nDear friends, as President of the European Parliament, I’ve met a lot of people - and there have been plenty of moments that I will never ever forget. One of those moments was when I addressed the hundreds of thousands of Moldovans at the European Moldova National Assembly rally, right here, in this city.\n\n\n\nI will never forget the sight of those European and Moldovan flags waving side by side, or the sound of voices united in one chant: “Europa este Moldova! Moldova este Europa!” The European Parliament cannot, and will not, close the door to that dream. This is a history we will write together - and I want to assure you that the European Parliament will remain with you every step of the way.\n\n\n\nMulțumesc.",

At the closing forum in Sarajevo, it was highlighted that BiH achieved all planned goals, focusing on economic development and European integration, and handed over the presidency to Bulgaria.\n\nSarajevo (Fena) – The presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the European Union Strategy for the Danube Region (EUSDR) has been assessed as very successful, with messages that BiH has demonstrated institutional maturity, the ability to coordinate and manage complex regional processes, and has confirmed its role as a reliable European partner, it was emphasized after the official opening of the 14th EU Strategy for the Danube Region Forum (EUSDR) in Sarajevo, which also included a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Danube region, as the concluding event of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s one-year presidency of the EUSDR, which Bosnia and Herzegovina took over from the Republic of Austria last year.\n\nThe organizers of the two-day 14th EU Strategy for the Danube Region Forum, held in Sarajevo, are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of BiH and the Directorate for European Integration of BiH.\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs of BiH, Elmedin Konaković, symbolically handed over the presidency of the EUSDR to the Minister for Regional Development and Public Works of the Republic of Bulgaria, Ivan Ivanov, as Bulgaria takes over the presidency from BiH.\n\nAddressing the media, Konaković stated that BiH has successfully passed an important test by presiding over the EU Strategy for the Danube Region and has shown that it can manage complex regional processes at the highest level in the interest of its citizens and partners.\n\nHe emphasized that all planned goals were achieved during the past year, with a special focus on economic development.\n\n– Our priorities were primarily focused on economic aspects that contribute to the development of the economy of BiH, and thus to addressing one of our biggest problems, the emigration of young people, as well as older individuals – said Konaković.\n\nHe thanked all partners and participating countries for their support, emphasizing the importance of the Danube Strategy as a platform that connects EU member states and those aspiring to membership.\n\n– Through this exchange of experiences with colleagues from the EU and their direct assistance, we can make some important strides, which we have done – he emphasized.\n\nHe particularly underscored the importance of the EU enlargement process and full membership of BiH, assessing that the country is “a few steps away from the historic opening of negotiations.”\n\nIn this context, he called on all political actors in BiH to understand the importance of adopting two European laws, the law on the court and the law on the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council, and to appoint a chief negotiator with the EU as a final step, who, as he said, must be extremely pro-European oriented.\n\nThe Director of the Directorate for European Integration of BiH, Elvira Habota, stated that the presidency of BiH of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region was one of the key tasks on the European path of our country, through which BiH demonstrated institutional maturity and the ability to coordinate the activities of 14 member states of the strategy.\n\nHabota noted that during the first presidency of BiH in this initiative, a series of activities and events were organized that brought together more than 350 representatives from institutions, civil and business sectors, while the concluding Forum in Sarajevo gathered more than 400 actors and partners from the EU and member states of the Danube Strategy.\n\n– The presidency confirmed that BiH can be a center of regional cooperation and a reliable European partner. We have shown that we are not just part of the European integration process, but also its active creator – she emphasized.\n\nAs she stated, BiH focused its presidency on topics that reflect the priorities of the EU and member states, among which support for the EU enlargement process and strengthening cooperation between member states and those in the accession process are particularly important.\n\n– The Danube Strategy has provided us with a range of opportunities, primarily the chance to learn, exchange experiences, and build partnerships that bring us closer to the European Union. Activities involving youth, civil society, and entrepreneurs were of particular significance – emphasized the director of the Directorate for European Integration.\n\nThe Minister for Regional Development and Public Works of the Republic of Bulgaria, Ivan Ivanov, also addressed the media, stating that Bulgaria will continue the presidency of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region in the same spirit of partnership that BiH successfully led this process during the past year.\n\nHe thanked his colleagues from BiH for their dedication and commitment during their presidency of the Strategy, leaving it with a clear focus and concrete results.\n\n– As Bulgaria takes over the presidency of the Danube Strategy, we do so with deep respect for the work invested during the previous presidency and with a strong sense of shared responsibility – said Ivanov.\n\nHe emphasized that the main priorities of the Bulgarian presidency will be to reduce regional disparities and create greater opportunities across the Danube region.\n\n– We believe that by strengthening the Danube region, we enhance our diversities and our ability to turn them into a driving force for common progress and solidarity – emphasized the Bulgarian minister.\n\nIvanov added that no region or community should be neglected and that Bulgaria will work to make the Strategy an even stronger platform for cooperation, solidarity, and connecting policies, financing, and people.\n\nThe Head of the European Union Delegation in BiH, Ambassador Luigi Soreca, emphasized that strengthening cross-border cooperation is at the very heart of the reasons for the establishment of the EU and that the EU Strategy for the Danube Region helps member states and candidate countries build stronger cooperation and ensure visible benefits for their citizens.\n\nSoreca also pointed out that the EU will continue to align macro-regional priorities with existing financial mechanisms, particularly taking into account the needs of youth and new generations.\n\n– The best guarantee for greater prosperity and stability, both for BiH and for the entire Danube region, is a shared future within the European Union – he said.\n\nHe reminded that the EU presented the Progress Report for all candidate countries this week and that the recent visits of high European officials Kaja Kallas and Marta Kos to BiH once again confirmed that EU enlargement is “the greatest European investment in peace, stability, and hope.”\n\n– Together we can turn opportunities into real progress for the Western Balkans and the entire Danube region – Soreca concluded.\n\nAt the meeting, the Sarajevo-Danube Declaration was also adopted, which is said to show a common vision for the Danube region.
