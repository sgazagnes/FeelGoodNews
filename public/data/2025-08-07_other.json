      "content": "A proclivity for dancing seems to be found in at least 10 species of cockatoo, and the birds will even jive to white noise or a financial podcast\n\nWhite cockatoos seem to have a natural proclivity for dancing Andrew Angelov / Alamy\n\nThe headbang, the side-to-side and the body roll are some of at least 30 dance moves used by captive cockatoos.\n\nCockatoos have been grabbing limelight online ever since Snowball, a sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita), became an internet dance sensation back in 2009. Then, in 2019, Aniruddh Patel at Tufts University in Massachusetts and his colleagues showed Snowball had invented 14 different movements and even combined some of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo investigate how common such behaviour is, Natasha Lubke at Charles Sturt University in Australia and her colleagues analysed 45 videos posted on social media of dancing cockatoos. They included five different species: sulphur-crested, white (Cacatua alba), salmon-crested (Cacatua moluccensis), Tanimbar corellas (Cacatua goffiniana) and little correllas (Cacatua sanguinea).\n\nThe team identified 30 distinct dance moves each done by at least two birds, 17 of which had not previously been scientifically described. Closely-related species didn’t seem to strut their stuff in a more similar way.\n\nLubke and her colleagues also experimentally investigated dancing in two sulphur-crested cockatoos, two pink cockatoos (Lophochroa leadbeateri) and two galahs (Eolophus roseicapilla) at the Wagga Wagga Zoo & Aviary in Australia.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThey played the birds a house music track – The Nights by Avicii – a financial podcast called She’s on the Money or white noise, and found the birds performed dance moves regardless of whether music was being played.\n\nThe cockatoos also didn’t seem to be bopping because they were imitating people. “We’re not really sure why they are dancing, but they could just be exhibiting the behaviours because they’re playing, and play is self-rewarding,” says Lubke.\n\nMany of the dance moves are similar to the courtship displays of wild parrots, which hints their dancing abilities may have originated as courtship behaviour, says Lubke.\n\nBased on video evidence, she and her colleagues conclude dancing behaviour is present in at least 10 out of the 21 species of cockatoo.\n\n“Snowball developed his moves without any formal training to dance, but it was not known if a parrot’s dance moves are largely determined by its genetic makeup. The new study shows that relatedness between species doesn’t predict how similar the dance moves of different parrots are,” says Patel, who wasn’t involved in the new study. “These findings are exciting because they demonstrate that flexible and creative dancing to music is not uniquely human.”\n\nBut which cockatoo species is the best dancer? “From the zoo study, the Major Mitchell [pink] cockatoos definitely looked like they danced a bit more and were more engaged than the other species,” says Lubke.\n\nShe says further research could determine whether the birds enjoy dancing and if encouraging it could improve the welfare of captive cockatoos.",

      "title": "Your pet dog’s ancestor was a fierce, wild animal. How was it tamed?",
      "summary": "Unexpected archaeological discoveries are rewriting the story of how the big, bad wolf became our first and most beloved pet",
      "content": "Unexpected archaeological discoveries are rewriting the story of how the big, bad wolf became our first and most beloved pet\n\nPatrick Reymer\n\nIn 1881, zoologist John Murdoch took part in an expedition to Point Barrow, Alaska, at the northernmost tip of the US. The goal was to conduct a two-year, unbroken observation of meteorological and magnetic phenomena and to document the nature and wildlife of the Arctic along the way. Travelling north through Alaska, Murdoch and his crew witnessed a peculiar act: an Iñupiat family captured two wolf pups and took them back to camp. The family carefully fed and nurtured the pups, raising them to adulthood before killing them for their fur. Murdoch was observing an ancient tradition. It turns out this Iñupiat practice might also hold the key to understanding the origin of modern dogs.\n\nHow ancestral grey wolves were transformed into humanity’s best friend has long been debated. For the past several decades, the prevailing hypothesis has been that wolves domesticated themselves. They initiated the process by first wandering around the periphery of human settlements and feeding on rubbish tips. Over time, they became habituated to the presence of people and formed mutually beneficial relationships with them. Only then did curious humans select and breed individuals with traits like docility and gregariousness, eventually giving rise to the pet canines we know and love today.\n\nThrough this unguided and unintentional process, wolves scavenged their way to domestication. Or so the theory goes. Recent evidence, however, has led many scientists to abandon the idea of self-domestication. If the revisionist thinking is correct, then humans, not wolves, were the driving force – and the domestication of dogs is evidence that humanity has a deep and complex relationship with wild animals that was born long ago.\n\nPopular perceptions of dog domestication have been shaped in large part by the late Raymond and Lorna Coppinger, who wrote a series of highly readable books on the subject at the beginning of the 21st century. The husband-and-wife team of biologists based much of their argument on “pariah” dogs that prowl human garbage dumps, feeding off leftovers and sometimes receiving direct aid from local people. “These animals are ownerless and survive largely on scraps of food waste from human settlements,” says archaeologist Loukas Koungoulos at the University of Western Australia. “They make up a majority of the species Canis familiaris worldwide – in some estimates up to 70 per cent of all dogs presently alive.”\n\nPariah dogs are the perfect analogue for wolves at the beginning of their domestication, the Coppingers argued. The idea they championed was that self-domestication occurred when humans transitioned from hunting and gathering to farming. This was when our ancestors became sedentary, living in larger groups and producing enough waste to attract wolves, in much the same way that pariah dogs are attracted to settlements today. This shift began around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\n“Finds of considerably earlier dogs would naturally disprove the idea,” says Koungoulos. And such finds have now emerged.\n\nEvolution of the first dogs\n\nPalaeontologists have discovered around two dozen fossil specimens of dogs ranging in age from 35,500 to 13,000 years old across Eurasia, in countries including Spain, France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Ukraine and Russia. These Palaeolithic dogs have a variety of physical characteristics that distinguish them from wolves. They weigh 31.2 kilograms on average, while Pleistocene wolves weighed around 41.8 kilograms. They also have shorter snouts, a slightly wider palate and shrunken canine teeth. These differences in morphology represent a changing body form that many scientists argue illustrates the budding signs of domestication. In addition, genetic analysis of ancient canid DNA points to south-west Asia and East Asia as the original centres of domestication. Although scientists are still calibrating the exact dates, it now seems clear that dogs emerged over 36,000 years ago in several locations independently. In other words, domestication long predates the transition from hunting and gathering to farming.\n\nCould these grey wolf pups hold the secret to how domestic dogs evolved? Debbie Steinhausser/Alamy\n\nSome supporters of the self-domestication idea have tried to salvage it by pointing out that palaeolithic hunter-gatherers killed large mammoths and herd animals like bison and deer, so they could have generated enough leftovers to attract and feed meat-hungry carnivores, including wolves. But this argument also has its problems. For one, we know Stone Age people were experts at using all kinds of animal resources and seldom left surplus waste, especially not close to where they were living. Besides, the practices of modern hunter-gatherers suggest that if our ancestors kept excess meat, they would have stored it away from scavengers on platforms or up in trees.\n\nAn even bigger obstacle is research showing that wolves are often seen as dangerous pests. If they get too close and comfortable with humans, they will occasionally prey on young children or other vulnerable members of society. There are documented instances of people killing wolves when they feel threatened by their presence.\n\nIt was evidence like this that turned Koungoulos firmly away from the self-domestication model. “I became pretty convinced that there are deep, consistent, almost structural barriers to self-domestication posed by the innate behaviour of wolves and the typical attitudes of traditional societies towards canids, which are, for the most part, rightly considered dangerous animals,” he says. “[Self-domestication] might make sense for some other domesticated species, but not for large carnivores like this.”\n\nIf not self-domestication, then what?\n\nThe appeal of puppies\n\nOne clue pointing to a different origin story comes from a growing understanding of wolf behaviour. Wolves are born blind and don’t develop eyesight until they are about 2 weeks old. During this critical period, they are highly adaptable and able to habituate to humans, which means they can form an attachment to a human caretaker, allowing pups to be safely nurtured and making it less likely they will attack anyone in the future. “If people are willing to put in the work, they can handle practically any type of canid as a companion,” says evolutionary biologist Raymond Pierotti at the University of Kansas, who has raised wolf pups himself. The key is to begin when they are still very young.\n\nOther clues can be found in the archaeological record. “Palaeolithic dogs are generally, but not always, found in Palaeolithic sites,” says archaeozoologist Mietje Germonpré at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. But they don’t just occur in close association with ancient humans and their settlements; there are also signs that these people had deep connections to dogs and other canids. At a site called ‘Uyun al-Hammam in Jordan, for instance, a fox was buried alongside two humans around 16,000 years ago. The excavators of this grave hypothesised the canine wasn’t a grave good, but a companion, buried together with its owners like part of the family. Numerous sites across Europe, Asia and North America suggest similar relationships.\n\nThe red fox buried alongside two people in a 16,000-year-old grave appears to have been a companion animal Maher et al\n\nGermonpré’s work on Palaeolithic dogs has made her an early and prominent advocate of an alternative model of domestication that is now taking hold among a growing body of academics. It sees wolf pups slowly becoming domesticated after first being adopted by humans as pets. Stone Age people would have taken wolf pups from the wild and nurtured them to adulthood. Then, later, by selectively breeding those with the most desirable traits, domestication would have gradually been achieved. Germonpré calls this the human-initiative model of dog domestication.\n\nIn fact, it isn’t a new idea. Probably the earliest and simplest version of it comes from Francis Galton, Charles Darwin’s cousin. Galton, a Victorian polymath most notorious for founding the field of eugenics, was an extensive traveller and documentarian. This, along with his many connections to the elite of his day, made him aware of the practices of Indigenous populations – including ones who took young wild animals as pets. Galton wrote about Indigenous peoples in North America who captured bear cubs and wolf pups, South Americans who caught and raised birds, and African populations who adopted young buffalo and antelope. This practice of taking young pets, thought Galton, could be the origin of domestication.\n\nModern ethnographic reports paint a similar picture. There are accounts from Russia of groups, including the Khanty and Mansi, keeping fox pups as pets and later killing them for their fur. In North America, the Inuit regularly adopted bear cubs into their families, allowing them to play with children and even sleep in their igloos. The Siberian Ket families also adopted young bear cubs, particularly if they had no children. The Ainu of northern Japan and eastern Russia did something similar, adopting and raising young bear cubs to later sacrifice in ritual ceremonies.\n\nAnthropologists have recorded many instances of hunters taking young carnivores back to camp and these animals being breastfed by women, a practice also mentioned by Galton. We now also know the tendency for cross-species adoption isn’t even confined to humans. Dolphins have been observed to adopt individuals from other species, as have monkeys. This hints that the desire to affiliate with and care for the young of another species has deep evolutionary origins.\n\nSacred animals of the Stone Age\n\nHowever, the modern version of Galton’s hypothesis goes beyond humanity’s fondness for puppies. Germonpré became interested in the earliest manifestations of canid domestication when studying the relationship that Stone Age hunter-gatherers had with cave bears (Ursus spelaeus). Cave bear bones, including skulls, were often burned, painted with ochre and deposited beneath rock slabs, indicating that these fearsome beasts were imbued with symbolic and ritual meaning. This might have given people another reason to want to adopt and raise bear cubs from an early age. “My interest in the pet model as a hypothesis grew from there,” she says, “with the idea that other carnivores, such as wolves, must have had symbolic value for Palaeolithic people, together with other worths and utilities.”\n\nArchaeological evidence supports this idea. Many excavated prehistoric sites reveal that Stone Age people had a wide variety of uses for wolves. Their teeth were turned into ornaments, perforated skulls hint at ancient rituals and cut marks suggest people ate wolves and fashioned their long bones into tools. But perhaps the most important resource a wolf provided was its pelt.\n\nWolf pelts have long been valued as a source of super-warm clothing by the Inuit Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nLike other species that live at high latitudes, wolves are adapted to thrive in cold conditions, and this includes sporting super-insulated fur with a mixture of long and short hairs. Historical reports recount hunter-gatherers living in northern latitudes across North America, Europe and Asia using wolf fur to line hoods, collars and other clothing. The Inuit historically captured wolf cubs, raised them and killed them for fur, which was also the fate of the Alaskan wolves adopted by the Iñupiat in Murdoch’s record. Likewise, wolf fur would have been a precious resource for people living during the last glacial maximum between around 26,000 and 19,000 years ago. For tens of thousands of years around this time, people had to endure some of the coldest and harshest climates of the past few million years. It is also the period to which many of the fossils of Palaeolithic dogs date.\n\nExactly how the process of domestication might have unfolded is unclear. “The specific Asian wolf that was ancestral to today’s dogs is gone forever, so the domestication of the dog can never be recreated under experimental conditions,” says Koungoulos. Nevertheless, he and others think there may have been parallels with a much more modern interaction between humans and wild canids. “One of the best analogues we have is the dingo and its relationship to Australian Aboriginal people – some of the only traditional hunter-gatherer peoples to have, until recently, maintained domestic relations with a wild canid,” he says.\n\nLiving with dingoes\n\nThe dingo provides a clear illustration of what happens when small bands of mobile people adopt young wild canines but don’t selectively breed them. Until recently, Aboriginal Australians regularly captured dingo pups and cared for them, but then let them go once they reached adulthood. Dingoes haven’t become domesticated despite thousands of years of this sort of association with people. “But this modern example hints at how a long-term tradition of keeping wild-born canid pups as pets could alter the behaviour of the free-living population, or at least parts of it,” says archaeologist Adam Brumm at Griffith University in Australia.\n\nSurvival of the friendliest? Why Homo sapiens outlived other humans We once shared the planet with at least seven other types of human. Ironically, our success may have been due to our deepest vulnerability: being dependent on others\n\nIn a paper co-written with Koungoulos and Germonpré, Brumm speculates that when returned to the wild to breed, dingoes may have taken up residence near Aboriginal camps, forming a sort of human-associated subpopulation apart from other dingoes. Their pups then also tend to be the ones taken from nearby dens and adopted as pets. “Perhaps something similar happened tens of thousands of years ago with the grey wolf, giving rise to the first canids we would recognise as dogs,” says Brumm.\n\nWe may never know for sure, but there are still looming questions that canid researchers hope to answer, including exactly where and when domestication originated. Germonpré wants to address these with further studies of ancient canid DNA. Whatever future studies reveal, however, the old story no longer seems plausible. “The self-domestication model still has a number of supporters and popular books out there,” says Koungoulos, “but my feeling is that, in the face of contrary evidence, they take increasingly fringe positions.”\n\nPierotti’s assessment is more direct: “Do not let yourself be beguiled by the Coppingers and their way of thought.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – For many years, scientists believed that wolves slowly tamed themselves by hanging around human settlements and eating leftovers. Over time, humans then chose friendlier wolves to become pets. This idea explained how wild wolves turned into dogs.\n\n**What happened** – New archaeological findings from Alaska suggest that humans played a more active role in taming wolves. In 1881, an explorer witnessed an Indigenous family caring for wolf pups, raising them before using their fur. This ancient practice hints that people deliberately took in wolf pups, helping to shape the early steps of dog domestication.\n\n**Impact** – These discoveries change our understanding of the relationship between humans and wolves. Instead of wolves leading the way, humans may have driven domestication by capturing and nurturing wolf pups. This shows a longstanding and active bond between humans and wild animals, not just accidental coexistence.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will continue studying archaeological sites and ancient human cultures to learn more about when and how people began domesticating wolves. This research could reveal new details about human history and how our close connection with dogs started.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New evidence suggests humans played a hands-on role in transforming wild wolves into the dogs we know today.",

      "content": "The Indonesian island of Sulawesi was a likely stepping stone for ancient hominins to reach nearby Flores, the home of the mysterious Homo floresiensis\n\nA stone tool found on Sulawesi, Indonesia, made by an unknown ancient hominin Budianto Hakim et al.\n\nSeven stone tools found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi are the earliest evidence ever discovered of ancient humans making a sea crossing, dating back up to 1.4 million years.\n\nThey may provide clues to how a tiny human species, nicknamed “hobbits”, ended up on the nearby island of Flores.\n\nThe first of the artefacts was found embedded in a sandstone outcrop at a site called Calio by Budianto Hakim at the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia in 2019, and a full excavation uncovered six more tools in the same outcrop.\n\nIn the same deposit as the stone tools, Hakim and his colleagues found part of the upper jaw, with teeth, of an extinct giant pig known as Celebochoerus, along with a tooth fragment from an unidentifiable species of juvenile elephant.\n\nWhile the researchers couldn’t directly date the stone tools, they were able to come up with an estimated age of between 1.04 million and 1.48 million years old by analysing the sediments and the fossil pig’s teeth. Until now, evidence of hominins on Sulawesi only stretched back to 194,000 years ago.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nAt least one of the newly discovered artefacts is a flake that was struck off a larger flake and then had its edges trimmed, says team member Adam Brumm at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. While non-human primates like chimpanzees have been known to use stones like a hammer to break open nuts, they don’t carefully work flakes to produce tools.\n\n“This is a very early kind of human intelligence from a species that no longer exists,” says Brumm. “We don’t know what species it was, but this is a human intelligence behind these stone artefacts at the site of Calio.”\n\nThe remains of a metre-tall hominin named Homo floresiensis were discovered on Flores in 2003. Archaeological evidence shows that hominins were on that island more than 1 million years ago, but it has been a mystery how an early human species could have made their way there.\n\nBoth Flores and Sulawesi had large expanses of sea separating them from mainland South-East Asia, even during the periods of lowest sea levels. Brumm says the distances between the mainland and Sulawesi were too great to swim and it is almost certain that these early hominins weren’t capable of building ocean-going vessels.\n\n“It may have been some sort of freak geological event, like a tsunami, for example, washing some hominins out to sea clinging to floating trees or vegetation mats of some kind, and then winding up on these islands in large enough numbers to give rise to these isolated populations,” he says.\n\nMartin Porr at the University of Western Australia says Homo erectus was the most likely candidate to have made the sea crossings, as this species was in South-East Asia at this time and made tools similar to those found in Sulawesi.\n\nHe says while the new work is consistent with this hypothesis, it also raises many new questions, especially whether the capabilities of these early hominins need to be revised.\n\nThe late archaeologist Mike Morwood, who led the team that identified Homo floresiensis, was the first to suggest that Sulawesi was an important place to search for potential ancestors of the hobbits, says Kira Westaway at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. This is due to the path of the Indonesian throughflow, a strong current that flows from Sulawesi to Flores.\n\n“But I think that even Mike would be pleasantly surprised by the antiquity of the stone tools found at this site,” she says. “It could be argued that seven tools is not a large enough assemblage to support large claims, but it certainly represents an early hominin presence.”",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long been curious about how ancient humans spread across islands in Indonesia, including Flores, where a small human species called Homo floresiensis, or “hobbits,” once lived. Until now, evidence for early humans on Sulawesi, a nearby island, was limited to about 194,000 years ago.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers discovered seven stone tools on Sulawesi that date back between 1.04 and 1.48 million years. These tools were found in a sandstone outcrop at a site named Calio, first uncovered in 2019 by Budianto Hakim and his team from Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency. Alongside the tools, fossils of an extinct giant pig and a juvenile elephant were found, helping to estimate the age of the site.\n\n**Impact** – These tools represent the oldest proof that ancient humans crossed seas in this region, suggesting they had the ability to travel over water long before previously thought. This finding may explain how hominins reached Flores and developed into the unique “hobbit” species. Unlike chimpanzees, these early humans shaped stone flakes into tools, showing a level of intelligence and skill.\n\n**What's next step** – Further research will focus on uncovering more evidence about the people who made these tools and how they lived. Scientists hope to better understand the migration patterns of ancient humans and their sea-crossing capabilities, which could reshape knowledge of human evolution in Southeast Asia.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Stone tools found on Sulawesi reveal that ancient humans were crossing seas over a million years ago, shedding light on the journey of the mysterious “hobbit” species on nearby Flores.",

Jusqu'à présent, les preuves d'humains anciens sur Sulawesi, une île voisine, ne remontaient qu'à environ 194 000 ans.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Des chercheurs ont découvert sept outils en pierre sur Sulawesi datant de 1,04 à 1,48 million d'années. Ces outils ont été trouvés dans un affleurement de grès sur un site nommé Calio, découvert en 2019 par Budianto Hakim et son équipe de l'Agence nationale indonésienne de recherche et d'innovation. Des fossiles d'un cochon géant éteint et d'un éléphant juvénile ont été découverts avec, permettant d'estimer l'âge du site.\n\n**Impact** – Ces outils sont la plus ancienne preuve que les humains anciens traversaient des mers dans cette région, suggérant qu'ils avaient la capacité de voyager sur l'eau bien plus tôt qu’on ne le pensait. Cette découverte pourrait expliquer comment les hominidés ont atteint Flores et ont évolué en la mystérieuse espèce des « hobbits ». Contrairement aux chimpanzés, ces humains anciens façonnaient les éclats de pierre pour créer des outils, montrant un certain niveau d'intelligence.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les recherches vont se poursuivre pour découvrir plus d'éléments sur les créateurs de ces outils et leur mode de vie.
