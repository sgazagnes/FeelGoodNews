      "summary": "OBSERVER: With the launch of Sentinel-6B, Europe builds on its ocean monitoring legacy\nsonia\nThu, 30/10/2025 - 09:58\n\nAs November approaches, the EU Space Programme is preparing for its next milestone in Earth Observation (EO): the launch of Copernicus Sentinel-6B, the second of two identical satellites in Europe’s sea-level monitoring mission. Set to launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, the satellite carries a sophisticated radar altimetry instrument capable of measuring sea-surface height with centimetre precision, providing essential data for understanding climate change and protecting coastal communities worldwide. In this Observer, we look at how the Copernicus Sentinel-6 satellite mission continues a thirty-year record of ocean altimetry with the launch of Sentinel-6B, ensuring continuity and precision in what has been an active year of satellite deployments for the EU Space Programme.\n \nGlobal sea levels continue to rise as Earth's climate changes. Coastal cities in Europe, from Rotterdam to Venice face increased flood risks, while small island nations remain among the most vulnerable to rising seas. Understanding exactly how fast seas are rising, and where, requires precise measurements from space and long time series.\nCopernicus Sentinel-6 is the reference satellite mission for sea-surface-height measurements, ensuring continuity of the global ocean topography record which started in 1992. Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (Sentinel-6A), launched in 2020, flies the long-established reference ground track, with a roughly 10-day repeat cycle, delivering centimetre-level sea-surface-height data together with significant wave height and wind-speed measurements.\nThanks to its state-of-the-art instruments, the satellite mission provides high-accuracy and stable measurements that serve as the benchmark for calibrating other satellite altimetry datasets, underpinning global mean sea level estimates and regional sea-level variability analyses.\nThe Copernicus Marine Service integrates Sentinel‑6 observations with those from other Copernicus Sentinel satellites and partner missions to produce operational oceanographic products and climate data records, providing downstream analyses and forecasts used by public authorities, industry, and researchers worldwide. Among these are the Global Ocean Along Track Sea Surface Heights data, visualised below, which provides measurements of the ocean’s surface height along the satellite’s ground track. Additionally, Sentinel-6 observations feed into products measuring global wave height and specific Ocean Monitoring Indicators (OMIs) focused on sea level rise.\nScientists use Sentinel-6 observations to monitor the rate of global and regional sea-level rise, map ocean currents, and derive sea-state parameters such as significant wave height, supporting coastal risk assessment, maritime safety, and climate policy applications in Europe and beyond.\nSentinel-6B, scheduled for launch in November 2025, will ensure the continuity of these measurements, maintaining the accuracy and stability of the global sea-level record. With a nominal lifetime of around five and a half years, it will provide users across the world with reliable data through 2030.\n\n\nThis visualisation, based on data from the Copernicus Marine Service, shows sea surface height observations acquired by Copernicus Sentinel-6A over a period of 10 days, from 1 to 10 October 2025. Credit: European Union.\n\n \nBuilding on a 30-year sea-level record\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-6 satellite mission builds on three decades of heritage in satellite radar altimetry, tracing its roots to the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and the subsequent Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 satellites. Together, these satellites have provided an uninterrupted time series of sea-surface height measurements since 1992, forming the global benchmark for sea-level monitoring. By maintaining the same reference orbit and cross-calibration approach, Sentinel-6 extends the long-term sea-level record that supports efforts to monitor and model long-term ocean and climate trends. Sentinel-6 also draws on European expertise developed through the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite mission and other Copernicus Contributing Missions, which refined radar-altimetry techniques and demonstrated how to ensure consistent and comparable measurements across successive satellites.\nSentinel-6 Michael Freilich and Sentinel-6B will operate in the same Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at approximately 1,336 kilometres above Earth. They follow the same ground track as their Jason-series predecessors to ensure direct comparability of measurements.\nThe satellite's primary instrument, the Poseidon-4 radar altimeter, sends radar pulses toward Earth's surface. By measuring the time these pulses take to bounce back from the ocean, the instrument calculates sea-surface height with centimetre-level precision. The Advanced Microwave Radiometer for Climate (AMR-C) sensor works alongside the altimeter, providing corrections for water vapour in the atmosphere which can affect measurements.\nThe Poseidon-4 instrument introduced a new open-burst radar operation enabling simultaneous Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Low-Resolution Mode (LRM) measurements. This dual mode capability provides double the number of radar samples compared to Sentinel-3, improving measurement precision while avoiding the introduction of bias into the long-term sea-level record.\nThe satellite also carries a Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) instrument which derives vertical profiles of temperature and humidity by analysing GNSS signals as they travel through the Earth's atmosphere. This information supports global weather forecasting and long-term climate monitoring, extending the Sentinel-6 satellite mission’s contribution beyond ocean observation.\n\n\nArtist’s rendering of the Sentinel-6B collecting ocean-surface height data using its Poseidon-4 radar altimeter. Credit: ESA/ATG medialab.\n\n \nA seamless transition in orbit\nSentinel-6B will join its predecessor, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, in orbit for about a year to allow cross-calibration and a smooth transition between the two satellites. During this tandem phase, both satellites follow the same ground track at intervals of less than one minute, observing the same ocean zones nearly simultaneously. This configuration allows scientists to perform cross-calibration and precisely align the two datasets. This process ensures that the three-decade sea-level record remains consistent and scientifically valid when the new satellite replaces its predecessor.\nOnce the calibration phase is complete, Sentinel-6B will play a key role in securing the continuity of this Copernicus reference altimetry mission, ensuring the maintenance of a high-accuracy climate record through at least 2030. This transition is critical because even minor discontinuities in the data could distort the measured rate of global sea-level rise.\nSentinel-6 provides near-global (95%) ocean coverage at 66 degrees inclination, revisiting the same location every ten days. This consistent measurement schedule supports both operational oceanography and long-term climate research.\nThe measurements from the Sentinel-6 satellite mission have supported improvements of approximately 60% of Copernicus Marine Service’s ocean data catalogue, including sea-level rise indicators, ocean current analysis, and wave forecasting. Acting as the reference dataset for other altimetry missions, Sentinel-6 ensures that Copernicus ocean monitoring products remain accurate and comparable across decades. This extensive use across a myriad of maritime applications demonstrates the mission's and Europe’s central role in global EO capabilities.\n\n\nArtist’s rendering of Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich.

Developed through partnership between the European Commission, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), with contributions from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the French Space Agency (CNES), the mission exemplifies international cooperation in space science.\nAirbus, serving as prime contractor, built both Sentinel-6 satellites, demonstrating European industrial capabilities in designing and operating complex space systems. Through the success of the Sentinel-6 satellite mission, Europe continues to support an innovative, growing, and robust space sector while delivering scientific and operational benefits to European citizens and international partners.\nThe satellite mission's data remain freely available to users worldwide as part of the European Commission's commitment to Copernicus’ open data access. Scientists, government agencies, and private sector users can easily and freely access Sentinel-6 measurements through the Copernicus Dataspace Ecosystem, WEkEO, and the EUMETSAT Datastore enabling applications ranging from climate research to maritime operations.\n \nAn unprecedented year for the EU Space Programme\nIn the past year, the EU Space Programme has undergone an exceptional period of Copernicus expansion. Following Sentinel-1C's successful launch in December 2024 and Sentinel-2C's entry into operational service in January 2025, the Programme has achieved an unprecedented pace of satellite deployments. Sentinel-1D is scheduled for launch on 4 November 2025, and will eventually succeed Sentinel-1A in its radar imaging mission. Sentinel-6B's launch later in November further reinforces Europe’s flagship Earth Observation space endeavours.\nThis rapid deployment schedule reflects both the growing maturity of the EU Space Programme and Europe’s sustained commitment to providing reliable satellite data for operational use. No other period has seen so many Copernicus satellites placed in orbit in such rapid succession, demonstrating Europe's growing capacity for complex space operations.\nThe successful launch cadence also ensures service continuity. As earlier satellites reach the end of their lifespans, new units seamlessly take over, maintaining the consistency of the long-term data streams which underpin the Copernicus Services. This continuity is what has made Copernicus a dependable foundation for European environmental monitoring and emergency response.\nAs Sentinel-6B begins its journey to orbit, it carries forward a thirty-year legacy of ocean measurements and maintains the precision and reliability established by its predecessor.

      "summary": "The decline in UK wildflower meadows not only threatens wildlife, say experts, but could drive up certain food prices",
      "content": "Martha Kearney: I'm worried about Britain's wildflowers - so my husband and I planted a meadow\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Martha Kearney Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nEver since I was a child I have loved wildflowers. I have fond memories of the woods in Sussex, where I grew up, filling with primroses early in the year and carpeted with bluebells in the spring. I always used their nicknames - \"eggs and bacon\" for birds-foot-trefoil (a native plant known for its yellow slipper-like petals) and \"bread-and-cheese\" for the young shoots of the British tree hawthorn, which my friends and I would eat. And pretend to like! We picked rosehips from hedges too, which we split open to make itching powder, perfect for playground pranks. But later in life, on my walks through the countryside, I began to notice dwindling numbers of wildflowers. I missed the grasslands, bursting with colour, that I'd so enjoyed in my childhood.\n\n'As a bee lover I'm on team pollinator - which is one of the reasons why my husband and I decided to plant our own wildflower meadow,' says Martha (pictured right)\n\nAccording to the charity Plantlife, approximately 97% of wildflower meadows have been lost across the UK since the 1930s, while species-rich grassland areas, which used to be a common sight, are now among the most threatened habitats. \"It's definitely a story of severe overall decline, both in the cover of flowers but also the diversity,\" explains Simon Potts, professor of biodiversity and ecosystem services at Reading University. So, what will happen if there isn't more intervention to save wildflowers? What will the future look like? \"Awful, in a word,\" says Prof Potts. \"If we, let's say, take a scenario where we just continue business as usual as we are now, we will still keep losing our wildflowers. \"And with that, we lose the beneficial biodiversity like the pollinators and the natural enemies of pests.\"\n\n'My husband cut the hay, initially trying with a scythe - Poldark-style - but a small tractor does the trick in a less backbreaking way'\n\nAs a bee lover I am on team pollinator - which is one of the reasons why my husband and I decided to plant our own wildflower meadow. Not just for the beautiful colours but for the vibrancy of the bees, butterflies and moths flying around, which need that habitat. Yet since then, I've come to understand that the loss of wildflowers could bring - and the other perhaps more unexpected consequences too.\n\nHigher food prices, less wildlife\n\n\"The consequence will be for farmers,\" argues Prof Potts. \"They will get low yields and poor quality crops, consumers will have to pay higher prices. Our environment will be degraded, eroded, will have less wildlife. \"Many of them [wildflowers] produce nectar and pollen, which is super important for things like wild bees, hoverflies, and butterflies, that can pollinate crops.\" Prof Daniel Gibbs, food security lead at the University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences, also has concerns about the long-term consequences. \"Over time, and alongside pressures from climate change and land degradation, this could make our food system more fragile, and negatively impact food security,\" he says - meaning we could, for example, find ourselves with more limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nPip Gray - Plantlife 'Farmers may have to rely more on manual pollination or we may need to look to increasing food imports, both of which can drive up prices,' says Prof Gibbs\n\nThere are also studies showing that fields near wildflower-rich margins or meadows produce better-quality fruit and higher yields. \"Wildflowers can also support some bugs, like spiders and carabid beetles… [which] do an absolutely fantastic job in controlling some of the pests that we get on crops - that can either damage the crop or sometimes lower the quality of the produce,\" adds Prof Potts. He describes wildflowers as almost like little factories, pumping out beneficial bits of biodiversity that can help with food production. \"Farmers may have to rely more on manual pollination,\" Prof Gibbs says. \"Or we may need to look to increasing food imports, both of which can drive up prices.\"\n\nFarming under strain\n\nMultiple factors are behind the decline. Sarah Shuttleworth, a botanist with Plantlife, argues that certain intensive farming methods have contributed. But some intensive farming methods have also allowed farmers to grow food for the country - and farmers I spoke to pointed out that they face tough financial choices. Though there have been government subsidies in place for years, meaning farmers are paid by the government to support wildlife on their land, since Brexit the way these grants are paid has changed, with different schemes designed in each of the devolved nations. In England, there has been frustration in some quarters about the speed and rollout of the grants and the fact that some schemes have been paused - such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), though this is due to reopen, while others extended at the last minute, leaving farmers less able to plan ahead.\n\nPlantlife The nectar and pollen of wildflowers is important for things like wild bees, hoverflies, and butterflies, says Prof Potts\n\nSpeaking about the SFI scheme, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson told the BBC: \"We inherited farming schemes which were untargeted and underspent, meaning millions of pounds were not going to farming businesses. \"We have changed direction to ensure public money is spent effectively, and last year all the government's farming budget was spent.\" They also acknowledged that wildflowers are vital, providing food and habitats for pollinators and wildlife, as well as improving biodiversity, and added: \"We are backing farmers with the largest nature-friendly budget in history and under our agri-environment schemes we are funding millions of hectares of wildflower meadows.\" As part of its new deal for farmers, Defra said it has committed nearly £250m in farming grants to improve productivity, trial new technologies and drive innovation in the sector.\n\nDavid Lord, a third-generation farmer in Essex, says he has never known farming to be under such strain\n\nMark Meadows, Warwickshire chair of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), maintains 6m (20ft) wildflower strips around many of his fields. He feared that without an extension to his current agreement with Defra he'd have to return some wildflower margins to crop production. \"I'd love [to] be profitable enough [to] say 'Look, we'll leave 5% of our farmland,'… but agricultural costs have gone up a lot,\" he says. Other farmers share similar tales. David Lord is a third-generation farmer in Essex and member of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. \"I'm 47 and I've never known farming to be under so much strain,\" he says. Knowing what funding for nature recovery on farms will be in place in future years is, he says, crucial. \"It takes time and care and cost to maintain [wildflowers]... A lot of farmers aren't going to be minded to just keep these habitats in place without the funding.\"\n\nWhy we created a meadow\n\nThere are some glimmers of hope. Prof Potts says there has at least been a slowdown in decline over the last couple of decades - and perhaps a limited recovery for some species. \"I think [this] reflects some of the agricultural practices that have been a bit more nature-friendly.\" Nature writer, and author of Flora Britannica, Richard Mabey, agrees that the decline in wildflowers is far from universal. Certain species such as cow parsley, yarrow and knapweed are in fact spreading, and he welcomes an influx of non-native plants and \"garden escapes\", such as snowdrop and buddleia. Even so, Prof Potts says: \"It is the most precious things that we're losing the most of.\" This includes cornflowers, corncockle and corn marigold - what he terms the iconic British countryside flowers. And the overall decline is why my husband and I decided to create our own wildflower meadow from an overgrown arable field.\n\nThe most spectacular year for Martha Kearney's meadow was last summer\n\nThere was a field next to our house, which I had put beehives in, with permission from the owner. I had often thought it would be wonderful to create a wildflower meadow around those hives, so when the opportunity arose to buy the field, we decided to go ahead. A conservation specialist advised us on where to buy the seed. It was particularly important to get some yellow rattle seed, which helps keep more dominant grasses in check. This in turn gives other wildflowers more opportunity to gain a foothold. Our first year after sowing was amazing. A patriotic bloom of red, white and blue burst across the field. The red was from poppies which came from the disturbed ground. The white was ox-eye daisies, bladder campion and wild carrot, with spires of bright blue from viper's bugloss. The colour has changed over time - the splash of red did not return, but different wildflowers arrived in their place.\n\nThe most spectacular year was last summer. Orchid seeds I'd scattered many years before and almost forgotten about, managed to flower. We counted more than 100 bee orchids — which to a bee lover like me, was the climax of years of work. In fairness, I should admit it's years of my husband Chris's work. He found an old-fashioned seed fiddle for us to use — a hand-held device used to scatter the seeds in a controlled way, operated as though drawing a bow across a violin. He also cut the hay at the end of summer, initially trying with a scythe - Poldark-style - but ultimately finding a small tractor does the trick in a less backbreaking way.\n\nWatch: Martha Kearney uses a seed fiddle to create her meadow\n\nOf course, many people are not in the fortunate position we found ourselves in, of being able to create a wildflower meadow. And in the UK, you cannot plant wildflowers just anywhere — you would most likely need the landowner's permission. But growing numbers of people are trying to create their own patches of wildflowers. Plantlife reports that more and more are joining its No Mow May initiative — an annual campaign to let wildflowers grow freely, by packing away the lawnmower. Sarah Shuttleworth says just a small spot can make a difference, especially when it comes to pollinators. \"Anyone who has a patch of grass could do their bit… the idea is that you're recreating a meadow-type management scheme, but in a very, very micro scale.\"\n\nTime for a radical rethink?\n\nThe charity would like to see wildflower habitats being given the same kind of protection as other precious landscapes. Meanwhile Prof Potts thinks, \"We need a bit more of a radical think about how to support farmers to do the right thing.\" New housing developments could also prove a way to create wildflower meadows. Under the government's Biodiversity Net Gain scheme, set up under the Environment Act, developers creating building sites are obliged to ensure the same amount of biodiversity at the end of the project, as they had at the start, plus 10%. Ben Taylor manages the Iford Estate, farming land near Lewes in Sussex. For a recording of Open Country on Radio 4, he showed me with great pride around a new wildflower meadow, which was part of a 90-acre site, funded as a pilot by the scheme. \"We have seen hares here now, which we never had a year or two ago, before we started doing this. So it's really exciting...\"\n\n'Our first year after sowing was amazing. A patriotic bloom of red, white and blue burst across the field'\n\nBut, I wondered, does it make sense to take all of those acres of land out of food production? Mr Taylor says the soil was poor there anyway. \"You have to have nature to be able to grow food,\" he adds. \"Because you need the pollinators as you need the ecosystem, the food chains, the soil webs and everything else to be able to grow food sustainably in the long-term - so I like to think of it as a reservoir of biodiversity.\" Many ecologists also want us to look beyond the benefits the wildflowers provide for us. \"Those species are just valuable in their own right, regardless of what they do or what they provide… They've also got their own right to be,\" argues Dr Kelly Hemmings, associate professor in ecology at the Royal Agricultural University. Richard Mabey stresses a similar point. \"They are important, in my view, for ethical reasons, simply because they exist. \"Beyond that they are the infrastructure of all other life on the Earth, the fundamental base of the food chain.\" Top picture credit: Getty Images",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context**\nWildflower meadows in the UK have been disappearing for many years. Since the 1930s, about 97% of these meadows have been lost. This decline affects not only the beauty of the countryside but also the insects like bees and butterflies that rely on wildflowers for food.\n\n**What happened**\nMartha Kearney, a BBC journalist, and her husband decided to plant a wildflower meadow near their home to help support local bees and wildlife. They bought a field, planted a mix of wildflower seeds, and cared for it carefully. Over time, many flowers and even rare orchids appeared, attracting lots of pollinators.\n\n**Impact**\nWildflowers provide nectar and pollen, which are essential for pollinators that help grow fruits and vegetables. Without enough wildflowers, farmers could have smaller crop yields and poorer quality food, which might make food prices go up. Wildflower meadows also support helpful insects that protect crops from pests. Martha’s meadow shows how individuals can help bring back these important habitats.\n\n**What's next step**\nMore people are encouraged to create wildflower spaces, even small ones like garden patches, to support pollinators. Experts suggest farmers and the government should work together to protect and restore wildflower habitats. New rules for building projects also require creating natural spaces, which can include wildflower meadows.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nPlanting wildflower meadows helps protect bees and other pollinators, which supports healthier crops and food supplies in the UK.\n",

Aulonia albimana, which was last recorded in the UK in 1985, was uncovered at the National Trust's Newtown nature reserve on the Isle of Wight - about 2km (1.2 miles) from the spider's former colony. The tiny orange-legged arachnid has informally been named the white-knuckled wolf spider by those who found it. Mark Telfer, who carried out the search with fellow entomologist Graeme Lyons, called it \"one of those unforgettable discoveries\".\n\n\"To find a species thought lost for 40 years is thrilling - and testament to how the right habitat management, combined with curiosity and collaboration, can deliver remarkable results,\" he said. Wolf spiders – of which there are about 38 species living in the UK – take their name from their agile hunting skills, which involve chasing prey along the ground before pouncing like a wolf. But the National Trust said the Aulonia albimana's hunting techniques remained something of a mystery, as the species was also known to spin a flimsy web.\n\nMr Lyons said: \"I suggested calling it the white-knuckled wolf spider because this was probably the longest long shot I've ever taken part in. \"We had just four hours at the site where this spider was last seen 40 years ago, before our boat came to pick us up. \"I found the first one with just nine minutes to go, and the second one in the last minute. \"I've seen 559 species of spider in the British Isles and this one was by far the most exciting find.\" Mr Telfer said the name was also inspired by the distinctive pale \"knuckles\" on the small leg-like appendages at the side of the spider's mouth.\n\nAulonia albimana was last recorded in the UK in 1985",

      "title": "Recycling Mystery: Expanded Polystyrene",
      "summary": "Is Styrofoam really recyclable?\nThe post Recycling Mystery: Expanded Polystyrene appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "It’s the eternal question: Can I recycle expanded polystyrene (commonly known by the brand name Styrofoam)?\n\nExpanded polystyrene (EPS) is everywhere: It holds your food, secures items in packages, provides insulation in homes, and even helps protect your head in your bike helmet. It’s designated by the plastic recycling code #6 PS, which (in unexpanded form) you’ll find in plastic cups and CD and DVD cases.\n\nHere’s a sobering fact: Americans dump approximately 1,500 tons of polystyrene in landfills daily, and less than 1% of it is recycled. That recycling rate is particularly disheartening when you consider that EPS is 98% air, making it technically recyclable—yet most communities lack the equipment and infrastructure to process it economically.\n\nHere’s the Problem\n\nEven if your community recycles plastic #6, it may not accept expanded polystyrene. That’s because EPS is an end product, and you can’t un-expand the plastic resin. However, facilities that are equipped to process EPS can grind it for use in other applications.\n\nPolyethylene foam is technically recyclable, but may not be accepted locally because the recyclers lack the equipment to process it. Because it’s so lightweight, EPS accounts for only 0.01% of the total municipal solid waste stream by weight, but, as you may have guessed, its volume is a greater problem than its weight. It takes up space in landfills and doesn’t biodegrade.\n\nThe recycling challenge has become so significant that several states have enacted bans on EPS foam packaging and products. As of 2025, Oregon, California, Delaware, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Washington have enacted legislation prohibiting various EPS products, including food service containers and packing peanuts. These bans reflect growing concern about the material’s environmental persistence and the microplastics it generates.\n\nRecycling and Reusing EPS\n\nWhile curbside recycling of expanded polystyrene is limited, recycling markets and innovative solutions are emerging. The form your EPS takes is the biggest factor that determines how to get rid of it. EPS packaging, especially packing peanuts, is often accepted at shipping stores for reuse, but these locations won’t take large blocks used in packaging, your to-go containers, or cups.\n\nDrop-off sites\n\nEarth911 Recycling Search can help you find polystyrene recycling in your area. Make sure to call local sites in advance to make sure EPS is accepted and in what form. If they do take EPS, most accept packing materials but not food or medical containers. The EPS Industry Alliance maintains a directory of EPS recycling companies, including businesses where you can drop off the material and those that will pick it up curbside. Make sure all containers are clean, empty, and free of tape, labels, plastic film, or other contamination. Contaminants can ruin the recycling process.\n\nInnovative Community Solutions\n\nExciting new technologies are making EPS recycling more accessible and economical. Foam Cycle has developed a self-service foam collection and recycling system that fits in a shipping container and can be installed at municipal transfer stations or community locations (listen to an interview with the founder). These systems process the foam on-site and have proven economically viable, breaking even in four to five years. A ton of the processed resin sells for between $300 and $500.\n\nFor communities looking for mobile solutions, innovative recycling systems like the Styro-Constrictor and Styro-Portapactor travel from location to location, densifying foam on-site. These mobile units reduce EPS volume by 90% and eliminate the need for costly brick-and-mortar recycling facilities, making the process more affordable than landfilling.\n\nMail-back\n\nIf a drop-off site doesn’t exist in your area, Terracycle offers a prepaid mail-in Zero Waste Box designed for EPS food packaging. At this time, we are not aware of any mail-in programs that accept large blocks of Styrofoam.\n\nReuse for loose fill\n\nWhat about packing peanuts? Their simplest reuse is in another package you need to ship. You can also donate them to The UPS Store outlets or other shipping stores, which will gladly reuse clean packing peanuts. Not sure where to go? The EPS Industry Alliance has real people answering questions about local options at 800-828-2214.\n\nLarge volume\n\nWorking with a recycling company for pick-up service is best if your business receives large amounts of EPS. Company requirements for storage and equipment vary, but it’s typical for storage containers to remain outdoors in a bin where EPS is kept clean, dry, and unexposed to the elements. It is wise to check with the company to see how they accept EPS, whether it be stacked, bagged, baled, or condensed.\n\nIf your business routinely handles large EPS pieces, look for devices from companies like RecycleTech or StyroMelt that reduce EPS volume for large-scale recycling.\n\nEPS Alternatives\n\nAs more governments consider and implement EPS bans and businesses phase out EPS foam packaging, you’ll likely start seeing alternatives. You can already find food packaging made from bamboo, cornstarch, mushrooms, and peat plastic, not to mention plantable packaging.\n\nThe wave of state-level bans is accelerating this transition, with California’s SB54 requiring that all plastic food packaging be recyclable and that manufacturers demonstrate that 25% of their material is recycled to continue operating in the state.\n\nIf costs dictate that you continue using expanded polystyrene, try to purchase EPS made from recycled content. Usually, green packing peanuts are made with a high recycled content, so if you ship a lot of material, spring for the off-white color EPS for your packages.\n\nEditor’s Note: Originlly published on March 9, 2014, this article was most recently updated in October 2025 with current statistics, state ban information, and new recycling solutions.",
