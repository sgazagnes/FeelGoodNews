      "title": "Why this rust-like mineral is one of Earth’s best carbon vaults",
      "summary": "A common iron mineral hiding in soil turns out to be far better at trapping carbon than scientists realized. Its surface isn’t uniform — it’s a nanoscale patchwork of positive and negative charges that can grab many different organic molecules. Instead of relying on a single weak attraction, the mineral uses several bonding strategies to hold carbon tightly in place. This helps explain how soils store enormous amounts of carbon for the long term.",
      "content": "Scientists have known for years that iron oxide minerals help store vast amounts of carbon by keeping it out of the atmosphere. A new study from Northwestern University now explains the chemistry behind that ability, revealing why these minerals are especially effective at locking carbon in place.\n\nBy closely examining ferrihydrite, a common iron oxide mineral, engineers discovered that it relies on several distinct chemical processes to capture and hold carbon. Rather than using a single method, the mineral employs multiple strategies that allow it to bind many different types of organic material.\n\nAlthough ferrihydrite carries an overall positive electrical charge, researchers found that its surface is far from uniform. Instead, it is made up of tiny regions with both positive and negative charges. This patchy structure allows ferrihydrite to interact with carbon in more ways than scientists previously understood. In addition to electrical attraction, the mineral forms chemical bonds and hydrogen bonds that create strong links between its surface and organic molecules.\n\nTogether, these mechanisms make iron oxide minerals highly adaptable carbon binders. They can capture a wide range of organic compounds and hold them for long periods, sometimes lasting decades or even centuries. This process helps prevent carbon from reentering the atmosphere as greenhouse gases that contribute to climate warming.\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology and offer the most detailed view yet of ferrihydrite's surface chemistry, a key factor in how soils store carbon.\n\n\"Iron oxide minerals are important for controlling the long-term preservation of organic carbon in soils and marine sediments,\" said Northwestern's Ludmilla Aristilde, who led the study. \"The fate of organic carbon in the environment is tightly linked to the global carbon cycle, including the transformation of organic matter to greenhouse gases. Therefore, it's important to understand how minerals trap organic matter, but the quantitative evaluation of how iron oxides trap different types of organic matter through different binding mechanisms has been missing.\"\n\nAristilde is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and studies how organic materials behave in environmental systems. She is also affiliated with the International Institute for Nanotechnology, the Paula M. Trienens Institute for Sustainability and Energy and Center for Synthetic Biology. Jiaxing Wang served as the study's first author, with Benjamin Barrios Cerda as second author. Both are postdoctoral associates in Aristilde's laboratory.\n\nSoil as One of Earth's Largest Carbon Sinks\n\nSoil stores an estimated 2,500 billion tons of carbon, making it one of the planet's largest carbon reservoirs, second only to the ocean. Despite its importance, scientists are still unraveling the exact processes that allow soil to remove carbon from the active carbon cycle and keep it underground.\n\nAristilde and her team have spent years studying how minerals and soil microbes influence whether carbon remains trapped or is released back into the atmosphere. Their earlier work examined how clay minerals bind organic matter and how microbes preferentially convert certain organic compounds into carbon dioxide.\n\nIn this latest research, the team focused on iron oxide minerals, which are linked to more than one third of the organic carbon found in soils. They concentrated on ferrihydrite, a mineral commonly found near plant roots and in soils or sediments rich in organic material. Even though ferrihydrite often appears positively charged under environmental conditions, it can bind organic compounds with negative, positive, or neutral charges.\n\nHow Molecules Attach to Iron Minerals\n\nTo understand how ferrihydrite interacts with such a wide range of compounds, the researchers used high-resolution molecular modeling along with atomic force microscopy to closely examine the mineral's surface. While its overall charge is positive, they confirmed that the surface contains a mix of positive and negative regions. This helps explain why ferrihydrite can attract negatively charged substances like phosphate as well as positively charged metal ions.\n\n\"It is well documented that the overall charge of ferrihydrite is positive in relevant environmental conditions,\" Aristilde said. \"That has led to assumptions that only negatively charged compounds will bind to these minerals, but we know the minerals can bind compounds with both negative and positive charges. Our work illustrates that it is the sum of both negative and positive charges distributed across the surface that gives the mineral its overall positive charge.\"\n\nAfter mapping the surface charges, the team tested how different organic molecules interact with ferrihydrite. They exposed the mineral to compounds commonly found in soil, including amino acids, plant acids, sugars and ribonucleotides. The researchers measured how much of each compound adhered to the mineral and used infrared spectroscopy to determine how the molecules attached.\n\nMore Than Simple Attraction\n\nThe experiments revealed that ferrihydrite binds organic molecules through several distinct pathways. Positively charged amino acids attach to negatively charged areas of the mineral, while negatively charged amino acids bind to positively charged regions. Some compounds, such as ribonucleotides, are initially attracted by electrical forces but then form stronger chemical bonds with iron atoms. Sugars, which bind more weakly, attach through hydrogen bonding.\n\n\"Collectively, our findings provide a rationale, on a quantitative basis, for building a framework for the mechanisms that drive mineral-organic associations involving iron oxides in the long-term preservation of organic matter,\" Aristilde said. \"These associations may help explain why some organic molecules remain protected in soils while others are more vulnerable to being broken down and respired by microbes.\"\n\nNext, the researchers plan to study what happens after organic molecules bind to mineral surfaces. Some may be transformed into compounds that microbes can further break down, while others could become even more resistant to decomposition.\n\nThe study, \"Surface charge heterogeneity and mechanisms of organic binding modes on an iron oxyhydroxide,\" was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and the International Institute for Nanotechnology.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Soil is one of Earth’s largest storage places for carbon, holding more carbon than the atmosphere. Scientists have known that iron minerals in soil help keep carbon trapped, but they did not fully understand how this happens.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Northwestern University studied a common iron mineral called ferrihydrite. They found that its surface is made of tiny areas with both positive and negative electrical charges.

      "summary": "A legendary golden fabric once worn only by emperors has made an astonishing comeback. Korean scientists have successfully recreated ancient sea silk—a rare, shimmering fiber prized since Roman times—using a humble clam farmed in modern coastal waters. Beyond reviving its luxurious look, the team uncovered why this fiber never fades: its glow comes not from dyes, but from microscopic structures that bend light itself.",
      "content": "A rare luxury material once worn only by emperors in ancient times has been successfully recreated by scientists in South Korea. Researchers led by Professor Dong Soo Hwang (Division of Environmental Science and Engineering / Division of interdisciplinary bioscience & bioengineering, POSTECH) and Professor Jimin Choi (Environmental Research Institute) have reproduced a shimmering golden fiber similar to one used more than 2,000 years ago. Their work relied on the pen shell (Atrina pectinata), a clam farmed in Korean coastal waters. Along with recreating the fabric known as sea silk, the team uncovered the scientific reason behind its long-lasting golden color. The findings were recently published in the journal Advanced Materials.\n\nSea silk -- often referred to as the \"golden fiber of the sea\" -- was among the most treasured materials of the ancient Roman era. It was reserved for powerful figures such as emperors and popes. The fiber comes from byssus threads produced by Pinna nobilis, a large Mediterranean clam that uses these threads to attach itself to rocks. Sea silk became famous for its luminous gold appearance, light weight, and remarkable strength, earning the nickname \"legendary silk.\" One well-known example is the Holy Face of Manoppello, a centuries-old religious relic in Italy believed to be made from this rare material.\n\nWhy Traditional Sea Silk Nearly Disappeared\n\nOver time, marine pollution and environmental damage have severely affected Pinna nobilis populations, pushing the species toward extinction. As a result, the European Union has completely banned harvesting the clam. This has turned sea silk into a historical artifact rather than a living craft, with only tiny amounts produced today by a small number of artisans.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, the POSTECH team focused on Atrina pectinata, a pen shell commonly raised for food in Korea. Like Pinna nobilis, this species produces byssus threads to anchor itself. The researchers discovered that the byssus from Atrina pectinata closely matches the physical and chemical properties of the original sea silk fibers. Using this knowledge, they developed a method to process the pen shell threads and recreate sea silk.\n\nThe Real Secret Behind Sea Silk's Golden Glow\n\nThe achievement did not stop at reproducing the fabric's appearance. The researchers also identified why sea silk maintains its golden shine for centuries. The color does not come from dyes. Instead, it results from structural coloration, which occurs when light interacts with tiny structures at the nanoscale.\n\nThe team found that sea silk's iridescence is created by a spherical protein structure known as \"photonin.\" These proteins form layered arrangements that reflect light in a way similar to soap bubbles or butterfly wings. Because the color comes from structure rather than pigment, it remains stable and resists fading over long periods of time.\n\nWhy the Color Lasts for Thousands of Years\n\nThe study also showed that color intensity depends on how neatly the proteins are arranged. The more ordered the structure, the brighter and richer the golden appearance becomes. Unlike traditional fabrics, where color is applied externally, sea silk's color emerges naturally from the internal alignment of its proteins. This explains its extraordinary resistance to fading across centuries.\n\nFrom Marine Waste to Sustainable Luxury\n\nAnother key outcome of the research is the transformation of pen shell byssus, which was previously discarded as waste, into a valuable textile. This approach reduces marine waste while opening the door to sustainable materials that also carry deep cultural and historical meaning.\n\nProfessor Dong Soo Hwang noted, \"Structurally colored textiles are inherently resistant to fading. Our technology enables long-lasting color without the use of dyes or metals, opening new possibilities for sustainable fashion and advanced materials.\"",

      "content": "Each year, over 11 million metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean, which is like dumping a garbage truck full of plastic every minute. For years, we’ve known that marine animals eat this debris, but no one had measured exactly how much plastic it takes to kill them. Dr. Erin Murphy, who leads ocean plastics research at the Ocean Conservancy, is the principal author of a major study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Her team analyzed more than 10,000 necropsies from 95 species of seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals worldwide. Earth911’s summary describes this critical study, which found lethal plastic thresholds that could change how we view the plastic crisis. The study measured how deadly different types of plastic are to sea life, which makes the results especially useful for policymakers. Each finding suggests a clear policy action, such as banning balloon releases like Florida has done, banning plastic bags as in California’s SB 54, or improving how fishing gear is marked and recovered. Still, Erin points out that focusing only on certain plastics is not enough. Her team found that even small amounts of any plastic can be dangerous. As she says, “At the end of the day, there is too much plastic in the ocean,” and we need big changes at every stage of the plastics life cycle, from production to disposal. There’s encouraging evidence that interventions work. Communities in Hawaii conducted large-scale beach cleanups and saw the Hawaiian monk seal population rebound. A study published in Science confirmed that bag bans reduce plastic on beaches by 25 to 47%. And Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup, now in its 40th year, removed more than a million plastic bags from beaches last year. These actions address a parallel crisis in human health that is building from the same pollution source. Most of the microplastics now found in humans and around the world began as the same macroplastics that are killing puffins and turtles. As Erin puts it, “I do view this all as part of the same crisis.” You can read the full study at pnas.org and learn more about Ocean Conservancy’s work at oceanconservancy.org.

Welcome to Sustainability In Your Ear. This is the podcast conversation about accelerating the transition to a sustainable, carbon-neutral society, and I’m your host, Mitch Ratcliffe. Thanks for joining the conversation today.\n\nWe’re going to talk about ocean plastics. Every year, more than 11 million metric tons of plastic enters the ocean. That’s the equivalent of dumping a garbage truck worth of plastic every minute. And we’ve known for decades that marine animals eat this debris. But until recently, no one had systematically quantified how much plastic it actually takes to kill them.\n\nAnd the answer is, it turns out, disturbing. Less than three sugar cubes worth of plastic increases an Atlantic puffin’s risk of dying by 90%. A loggerhead turtle reaches the same threshold at about two baseballs worth, and for a harbor porpoise, a mass of plastic roughly the size of a soccer ball can kill. More concerning, at the 50% mortality level — that is, where half the animals who consume the plastic die — the volumes that kill them shrink to less than one sugar cube for a puffin and half a baseball for a loggerhead turtle.\n\nOur guest today, Dr. Erin Murphy, is the manager of ocean plastics research at the Ocean Conservancy, and lead author of the study that produced these findings, published last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Her team’s research analyzed more than 10,000 necroscopies across 95 species of seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals worldwide. It’s the most comprehensive assessment yet of how different plastic types — soft film like bags, hard fragments, synthetic rubber from balloons, and abandoned fishing gear — translate into mortality across marine life.\n\nThe findings matter beyond ocean conservation. A 2024 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found microplastics embedded in human arterial plaque of cardiovascular surgery patients, and those with detectable plastics were 4.5 times more likely to suffer a heart attack, stroke, or death in the following three years. The same polymers killing seabirds and sea turtles — polyethylene, PVC, and their chemical additives — are found in human blood, lungs, liver, and placenta.\n\nDr. Murphy’s research offers policymakers what they’ve been asking for: science-based data to inform decisions about which plastics to regulate and how aggressively to act. Nearly half the animals in her study that had ingested plastics were threatened or endangered species, and with global negotiations on a binding plastic treaty continuing and extended producer responsibility programs expanding across the United States, the timing of this research could not be more relevant.\n\nSo we’ll talk with Erin about what her team found, why balloon fragments are amongst the deadliest items for seabirds, how fishing gear became the leading killer of marine animals, and what her research means for the humans who share a planet and a body burden with these species. You can read the full study at pnas.org and find Ocean Conservancy’s work at oceanconservancy.org. Ocean Conservancy is all one word, no space, no dash. Oceanconservancy.org.\n\nSo how much plastic is too much for wildlife and for humans? Let’s find out right after this brief commercial break.\n\n[COMMERCIAL BREAK]\n\nWelcome to the show, Erin. How you doing today?\n\nErin Murphy 3:44\n\nI’m doing well. Thank you so much for having me.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 3:46\n\nWell, thank you for joining me, and for this really important research. It was a fascinating read. We wrote it up, and I’m really pleased that you would join us to talk about it today. So can you explain what made this study different from previous attempts to quantify plastics’ lethality to marine life?\n\nErin Murphy 4:01\n\nYeah. So first, I’ll specify that we focus specifically on macroplastics, which are just plastics that are bigger than five millimeters in length. There’s more research on how microplastics, which are these smaller plastics, can harm animals, because scientists can study these in laboratory settings. Of course, it’s not feasible or ethical to feed animals like whales, sea turtles, or seabirds large plastic items and study what happens to them in the lab. And so as scientists, we really have to depend on opportunistically collecting dead animals in the environment and looking at what’s inside them to understand what’s happening with these bigger plastics.\n\nAnd so previous research has looked at these sorts of threats as well, but they focused on fewer species, on smaller geographic areas, and they didn’t differentiate by plastic type, like hard plastics versus soft plastics. So they were really important for laying the groundwork for our larger study. But we were actually able to look globally and look at a broader set of species, and also differentiate by these different plastic types and by species size as well, which allowed us to get at some of these species-level understandings.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 5:13\n\nSo the unfortunate truth is, we are feeding these animals this material by throwing it all away. That is a stark way of starting this conversation. And you use a lot of illustrative examples, like three sugar cubes worth of macroplastic can kill a puffin. How did you arrive at those kind of volume-based comparisons, and why is translating your data into those relatable measures important?\n\nErin Murphy 5:37\n\nYeah, so when we did this in the study, we actually looked at the influence of volume based on the animal’s body length. So we reported all of this as a deadly volume per centimeter of body length. But telling people 0.098 centimeters cubed per centimeter doesn’t really mean anything to them. And honestly, when I first got those centimeter-based thresholds, it didn’t mean that much to me.\n\nAnd so we thought that choosing some iconic species that people could picture would help, but still saying, you know, three centimeters cubed of plastic kills a puffin, or 220 centimeters cubed of plastic kills a loggerhead, doesn’t really paint a picture in people’s heads, and three sugar cubes or a baseball are much easier to picture.\n\nSo we chose to do this because I think when people can picture these items, they can really understand that volume, and people do use plastic every single day, and so having volumes like that to compare to allows them to think about how little plastic can kill animals, especially when we compare it to how much we produce or use globally.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 6:42\n\nCan you put in context how long it takes for a puffin, for instance, to eat that much plastic? What do they eat in a day or a week generally?\n\nErin Murphy 6:52\n\nYeah, that’s a great question, and it’s actually the next step in our research. So to estimate the risk that something poses to wildlife, we have to understand two things. One is your question: how likely are they to be exposed to this threat? The second is, if they are exposed to it, how likely is it to harm them? And so this research really focused entirely on that second piece.\n\nBut to fully understand risk, we have to dig deeper into the first part, and that’s what we call likelihood of exposure. And so for puffins specifically, there’s not a lot of research, but we do know a lot about what species are eating, and we know that different species are more or less likely to eat plastic based on where they live, what they eat, and how they feed. So we’re really excited to be working with some really amazing researchers over the next few years to think about how we can connect exposure for these animals to the lethality and understand risk in a more comprehensive way.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 7:48\n\nI want to get a sense of what you found. You mentioned in the study that one whale can have a three-gallon bucket in its stomach. What’s the range of objects that you encountered as you were doing the research?\n\nErin Murphy 8:00\n\nYeah, this was pretty unbelievable to me, actually, some of the things that we saw in animals, and I’ll just give a few items that stood out to me. But there’s many more. Part of an oar handle from a plastic — or a plastic belt, webbing from the back of a lawn chair, a koozie, rubber pencil topper, fake Easter grass, ice cream tubs, single-use coffee pods, bungee cords, tons of different types of gear, ropes, nets, fishing line.\n\nBut I’ll just illustrate kind of how dramatic this can look with one example that really stood out to me, on a sperm whale that researchers in Spain reported on. Sperm whales feed very deep in the ocean, and they use echolocation to find their food. So it may be particularly hard for them to tell plastic from prey. And in this case, it seems like an entire greenhouse washed into the ocean, and this sperm whale happened upon it. It had plastic film cover material for a greenhouse in its stomach, along with a flower pot, a piece of a hose, a plastic burlap sack, plastic craft, and plastic spray bottle, and even fake plastic mulch in its stomach. And unfortunately, this was one of the individuals that did lose its life to plastic ingestion.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 9:23\n\nThat’s — I mean, that’s shocking in so many ways. You found that one in five animals had plastic in their digestive tract when they died. Was this percentage higher or lower, and in the context of your previous answer, more or less shocking than you expected?\n\nErin Murphy 9:45\n\nYeah, I think, you know, it was higher than I expected. And it’s funny, because all of our research was based on previous research. It was a meta-analysis. So we collected data from existing literature. And I’d seen some, you know, similar numbers then reported at more local scales. But I think it still really shocked me to look at so many studies and see, you know, for sea turtles, that was one in two. Sea turtles had plastic in their gut. And for seabirds, one in three.\n\nAnd when thinking about that at a global scale, that felt higher to me than it should be, and I suppose it’s because it is higher than it should be. These really are high ingestion rates. And for some of these individuals, the bulk amount of plastic in their gut, like that sperm whale, is particularly shocking.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 10:35\n\nI want to step back just for a second and talk about how long this kind of research has been going on. Because when I was a child, oceanography was very much in its infancy. How aggressively are we trying to understand what we’re doing to the ocean environment at this point, and where do you think we are in terms of the long arc of beginning to reach that understanding?\n\nErin Murphy 10:58\n\nYeah, I don’t know if we’ll ever fully understand it, which is one of the things that makes studying the ocean so interesting. It’s so complex and vast. But, you know, we’ve come a long way, and for plastic pollution in particular, the ’70s was really when we started seeing those first reports of animals eating plastics. You know, and it’s been 50 years since then. Now we have evidence of plastic ingestion in more than 1,300 species, and we’re starting to be able to get at these really more complicated analyses that help us understand like the potential quantity that kills an animal, like this one, or what does that mean possibly for populations.\n\nI think the thing that’s been really impressive in the last decade, though, is how much research has been done on plastics. In particular, 10 years ago, roughly, the first study came out by Jambeck et al. that gave us an idea of the amount of plastic that was getting into the environment. And since then, we have learned so much as a scientific community, and people are working really hard to try to understand what these vast amounts of ocean plastic mean for ecosystems, for human health, for fishing industries and other marine industries that really depend on a healthy ocean, and we’ve been doing a lot of research on how to address it. So I don’t think we’ll ever fully understand everything that we’re doing to the ocean, but I think we’re working hard as a scientific community to get there.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 12:38\n\nIt’s really disturbing to think about, because plastic in the 1970s was really only — was 10 years into widespread use, and widespread compared to today is nothing, since half the plastic we’ve manufactured in history has been made since 2002. So it sounds like what we’re really delving into now is a real-time accounting of the damage that we’re doing. How do you as a scientist think about what your goal is in terms of bringing the consequences of our decisions back to the public so we can think about it?\n\nErin Murphy 13:11\n\nYeah, that’s why I feel very lucky to work with an organization like Ocean Conservancy. We conduct research that we know governments and decision makers need to help address these problems, and we have a policy team and a communications team that are really well trained on helping us bring this research to the decision makers.\n\nAnd the type of research we’re doing here, in particular on risk assessments, is something that governments are really craving. They want to set science-based targets as they try to address plastic pollution, and part of that is understanding environmental thresholds that we should be aiming for to better protect marine wildlife, to better protect marine ecosystems.\n\nAnd so when we do research like this, a big part is getting it into the literature, in this sense to the scientific community, but it’s also working with our policy team and our communications team to make sure the public hears about it, and to make sure that decision makers nationally and abroad hear about the work that we’re doing, and can use this to help inform science-based targets that they’re setting right now.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 14:22\n\nSo one of the materials that you found was most dangerous is rubber, particularly from balloons. It emerged as especially deadly for seabirds, where you estimated that just six pea-sized pieces could create a 90% mortality rate. What’s happening physiologically with balloon fragments that make them so lethal?\n\nErin Murphy 14:45\n\nYeah, so if you think about the design of a balloon, they’re super stretchy, and they’re long and they’re thin, and even the fragments seem to have this shape. And so they get stuck at those junctures in the gastrointestinal tract, like between the stomach and the intestine. And the gut moves things along through these wave-like contractions. And it seems like these stretchy materials just kind of stretch with it, and so the gut just isn’t able to move them through as easily. And we see similar things for those plastic bags as well.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 15:20\n\nWell, you also point out that sea turtles appear to mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. Is there anything we could do in terms of the chemistry of soft plastics or the appearance of soft plastics to make them less attractive to sea life?\n\nErin Murphy 15:35\n\nYeah, I don’t know if there’s a way that we can make them less attractive that I know of. And it’s unfortunate, because we know there are a lot of plastic bags in the environment compared to other plastics. Every year, Ocean Conservancy organizes the International Coastal Cleanup, and plastic bags are consistently in the top 10 items we see most frequently.\n\nThat being said, we do know ways of keeping plastic bags out of the ocean and protecting turtles in that way. And so every year — or in this last year, during our Coastal Cleanup — we collected, or our partner organizations collected, more than 1 million bags off our beaches. So this is really important for helping protect ocean animals, because those bags are already very close to their environment, and by removing them from beaches, we prevent them from getting into the ocean.\n\nWe also know that plastic bag bans, like the policy that California just implemented, are very effective in reducing the threat that plastic bags pose to marine wildlife, and help by preventing them from getting into the environment in the first place. So there was a recent study published in Science that actually showed that communities that implement bag bans, whether that’s a city, a state, or a country, do meaningfully reduce the amount of plastic bags that end up on beaches by 25 to 47%. So that’s a really significant reduction, and just provides further evidence that we know how to address some of these threats. We have ways of measuring if policies are effective, and it’s really about preventing these bags from getting into the environment in the first place.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 17:18\n\nAnother example of really short-term human thinking is the impact of fishing gear pollution. Can you talk a little about what you found in terms of what’s being tossed overboard by the boats that are hoping to treat the ocean as an ongoing resource and source of living?\n\nErin Murphy 17:36\n\nYeah. I mean, I think a lot of the fishing gear that’s lost is lost on accident. Fishing gear can be really expensive for fishermen. Like crab pots can cost thousands of dollars. And so these are very valuable resources for fishers, and they’re expensive to replace.\n\nBut unfortunately, one of the challenges with fishing in turbid and wavy environments around storms, especially with things that are set, is that some gear does get lost. And we did see interactions and ingestion of fishing gear by many of these animals. And partially that’s because gear attracts prey species. So we know that for some animals, they’re more likely to interact with fishing gear, and this isn’t just ingestion, but also being entangled in fishing gear, because, you know, that gear is still fishing. And for a lot of these bigger species, fish are their prey, and so they’re also being drawn to these devices, or this lost gear that might have their food in it.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 18:44\n\nAnd your study didn’t look at the external plastic lethality, it was only that which was consumed. So we don’t really fully understand what the consequences of, say, for instance, a net lost at sea is for the ocean yet? Or do we?\n\nErin Murphy 19:01\n\nYeah, we have — there’s some studies that have looked at this, but this is actually another study we’re working on. So one of the next papers we’re working on right now is looking at entanglement lethality, and that really will be important for understanding the impacts of plastic pollution together, because ingestion and entanglement, when we talk about these bigger plastics, are the two main threats that we see.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 19:24\n\nI feel like we’ve got our bearings and can have a really productive conversation. But folks, we’re going to take a quick commercial break. We’ll be right back.\n\n[COMMERCIAL BREAK]\n\nWelcome back to Sustainability In Your Ear. Now, let’s get back to my discussion with the Ocean Conservancy’s Dr. Erin Murphy, who led a groundbreaking study about the lethal effects of macroplastics in sea life. Erin, nearly half the animals that you studied that had ingested plastics were already listed as threatened. Is plastic pollution accelerating extinction risk, and what species do you feel are most endangered?\n\nErin Murphy 20:03\n\nYeah, that’s a great question. Right now, there’s not a lot of research yet on population-level effects of plastic pollution, and our study is really helping build that information out. But it’s just very difficult to understand what’s happening to populations that often we have trouble studying in the first place.\n\nStill, for many marine species, the IUCN Red List notes plastic pollution as a significant threat. Six out of seven sea turtle species are threatened. We saw really high ingestion rates for sea turtles. We know that 5% of the turtles in our data set died from plastic ingestion.\n\nSo I think there is a lot of evidence suggesting that this could be contributing to extinction risk. And there are some studies that look at very specific populations that we know are vulnerable, like the Hawaiian monk seal, that have found that plastic pollution is contributing to extinction risk.\n\nAnd the hopeful piece in the Hawaiian monk seal case was actually that as communities started doing large-scale cleanup efforts in the Hawaiian Islands, they actually saw a rebound of that population. So again, just a reminder that even though we know that this is something that is posing a threat to marine species we really care about, it’s also evidence that targeted and effective intervention strategies can be really important in helping some of these species rebound.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 21:34\n\nThat’s encouraging. So it isn’t as though we’re doomed, or that nature is doomed. We can intervene in our behavior today and make a change for the better in the future. How does the Ocean Conservancy encourage people to do that?\n\nErin Murphy 21:49\n\nYeah, so there was a study that we — some of us co-authored, and the Ocean Conservancy supported — that came out in 2020 that looked at what we would really need to do on a global scale to reduce plastic pollution in the ocean meaningfully enough to hit some of our potential targets. And in this case, we were thinking about just returning to 2010 annual leakage rates into the environment.\n\nAnd what we found is that we really need sweeping change to our relationship with plastic and our waste management systems. And so we found that to achieve this goal, we would need a 40% reduction in plastic production globally. We would need waste management to reach levels of 98 to 99%, depending on the income of the country. And we would need, annually, 40% of waste that gets into the environment to then be cleaned up.\n\nAnd at Ocean Conservancy, we really work on policy efforts in all three of those big buckets. And so we have the International Coastal Cleanup, but we also work on upstream policies with our policy teams at the sub-national, national, and international levels to try to work towards some of those goals of reducing plastic production and better managing the plastic waste that we do use.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 23:10\n\nYou used the phrase “our relationship with plastic,” which is an interesting concept. In 2024, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that microplastics were found in human arterial plaque, and that resulted in much higher risk for cardiovascular events. Do you see what you’re studying as a parallel crisis, or the same crisis, just in a different species?\n\nErin Murphy 23:35\n\nYeah, I view that — you know, so they were looking specifically at microplastics, and we focused on macroplastics in this study. That being said, most microplastics that are in the environment are breaking off of these larger macroplastics. So in that sense, I do view this all as part of the same crisis, and I think we need to think about all of the harms that plastic materials are causing to human health, to animal health, and to sociocultural outcomes like our marine and terrestrial industries that are affected by plastic pollution, and we need to think about comprehensive policies that are addressing all of those harms.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 24:17\n\nAre there studies that are showing the same types of impacts from plastic in human and non-human species that we can use to start to tell the story in that same illustrative way that you did with the sugar cube analogy, so that people really take this seriously? I mean, the problem with our society is that we’re accustomed to throwing everything away.\n\nErin Murphy 24:40\n\nYeah, so there’s a lot of really great research that’s being done on microplastic exposure in other marine and aquatic organisms, and those are more similar to what’s happening in humans. But that human research, and the research on sort of sub-lethal microplastic risks — like the risks to cardiovascular systems, nervous system, gastrointestinal tracts — those are all pretty new, and so this body of research is really building, and I think we’re going to learn a lot in the next decade.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 25:14\n\nDo you see an acceleration of your ability to make those kinds of conclusions — well-grounded conclusions — emerging as a result of the advent of something like artificial intelligence? Are we at the dawn of a scientific revolution?\n\nErin Murphy 25:33\n\nYou know, that’s a good question. I don’t know in what ways AI will change the way that we’re doing research. Definitely, the rate at which we are producing research has increased. There’s more people working on these issues, and the scientific process is really just about iterating as a community and building on what we know. And so I think what we’re seeing here is a large-scale interest in this plastics issue and a big concern by the scientific community and by the public.\n\nAnd as we learn more, we can answer more complicated questions. And so I was only able to do my work because over the last five decades, people have been studying what plastic is in the animals and reporting on that, and we have thousands of published papers now that tell us about what animals are consuming. And each one of those papers is really important in producing this bigger picture. And as we have, you know, similarly more studies on these sort of individual systems and humans, using model organisms like mice, we will be able to do the same sort of thing of painting this bigger picture for humans as well.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 26:48\n\nSo as we get this higher-resolution view of what we’re doing, both to the planet and to ourselves, how does Ocean Conservancy potentially use those storytelling opportunities to get us to think about things like plastic bans, or the impact of extended producer responsibility on not just what ends up in the environment, but what we design so that it doesn’t end up in the environment in the future? It’s a big, complicated, multifaceted story. Where are we going?\n\nErin Murphy 27:17\n\nYeah, that is true, and I am not the policy expert at Ocean Conservancy, but the work that they do is amazing. And they, you know, they go and they talk to the public about these issues and educate the public through blogs and other resources to make sure that people understand the scale of the problem. And they work really closely with local decision makers who are interested in addressing these problems and help them develop bills, help them build support for bills. And, you know, we’ll meet with legislators and other leaders to help them kind of understand the reason that these policies are useful.\n\nSo Ocean Conservancy in the last 10 years has done a lot of work on state bills, like helping to push forward California’s SB 54, or specific bills that are targeting problematic plastics. Like recently, Florida passed a balloon release ban. Ocean Conservancy was also really involved in pushing that.\n\nAnd I think we have seen with plastic pollution — what, for me, one of the things that’s most comforting in studying plastic pollution is actually that people do really seem to care about this issue and do seem willing to make change. So when people find out what I research — strangers — they always tell me about what they’re doing to reduce their plastic footprint, and I think that’s just a sign that there is appetite for change, and people want to understand how to do it. And as an organization, we’re just trying to leverage that passion and that stewardship that does kind of inherently exist in people, especially when they see the plastics that they’re using, and use that and sound science to help develop policies that can actually make a change on this issue.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 29:06\n\nBuilding on what you mentioned a moment ago, based on your findings about which plastics are the most lethal, it sounds like it’s a blend. But should policymakers prioritize specific materials, or just look at broad categories? No more of this type.\n\nErin Murphy 29:23\n\nI think we need to do both. So we did find that different plastics pose different levels of risk, and I think there’s policies that are smaller and easier to implement, like balloon release bans and bag bans, that are effective in targeting some of these problematic plastics specifically. You know, using that Hawaiian monk seal example as well, having very targeted and strategic cleanups can be really important for protecting animals at sea turtle nesting beaches or seabird nesting areas. There’s these areas that we know are of particular importance for animals.\n\nBut still, the total plastic thresholds that we found were also low, and we see all types of plastics in these animals. So at the end of the day, there is too much plastic in the ocean, and we do need sweeping reforms along the entire plastics life cycle, from production to management to disposal, to meaningfully address this issue and protect our oceans.\n\nAnd it takes longer to implement these policies because it does require some pretty extensive system-wide changes. But I think policies like California’s SB 54, which aims to reduce 25% of single-use plastics used, that’s really a step in the right direction. And so our policy team is on the front lines of making sure that that bill is fully implemented and that we understand the benefits of that policy by monitoring outcomes and effectiveness of it.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 30:56\n\nYou mentioned earlier that on the International Coastal Cleanup Day, which is a distributed event all over the world but a day, they collected more than a million plastic bags last year. Is the goal in the long term to no longer need to do those cleanups? Or do you anticipate that we’re always going to be needing to do those cleanups?\n\nErin Murphy 31:18\n\nYeah, I think unfortunately, at this point, it’s hard to imagine a world where cleanups aren’t necessary. I think when we did that study in 2020, that was led by Lau et al., it was pretty alarming to see how much we would have to reduce plastic production and how well we would have to manage waste to no longer need cleanups at all, and we really did find that cleanups needed to be an important part of this solution.\n\nAnd there’s already a lot of legacy plastics in the ocean. So I think as far as we can look forward, cleanups will always be an important part of the suite of solutions that we use.\n\nThey’re also really effective for monitoring what’s happening in our ocean. So I mentioned earlier that study that was published in Science that showed that plastic bag bans are effective. We were really excited to see that they actually used Ocean Conservancy International Coastal Cleanup data to do that analysis, and it really just emphasizes the value of citizen science. When you go out and collect data during a cleanup on your beach, we can see what changes occur through time in terms of what debris you’re seeing, and that helps us better understand whether it’s targeted policies or these broader policies, if they’re being effective or not.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 32:42\n\nWhat does the Ocean Conservancy do to help people do citizen science beyond the International Coastal Cleanup?\n\nErin Murphy 32:49\n\nSo that program has been going on for 40 years, and that’s really, in terms of citizen science, our main body of work. But we are interested in having citizens engage in other ways. So we often have — you can sign up for our newsletter and get information about opportunities to call your senators or write your senators or legislators about important ocean issues that are coming up.\n\nAnd we also just have a lot of educational material so that people can start their own cleanup events, or find cleanup events to participate in, so that individuals can be engaged in being part of the solution.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 33:31\n\nYou’ve mentioned a couple of items of research that you are beginning to pursue now. But if you had unlimited resources for the remainder of your career, what would you like to investigate and build on those findings with?\n\nErin Murphy 33:44\n\nYeah, it’s pretty hard to imagine unlimited resources, especially now, I know. But yeah, you know, we already started working on answering some of these next questions that are remaining for us, and I’m really excited about the work that we’re going to be doing over the next three to five years. And I will not be surprised if, you know, this body of work, trying to understand what’s happening to ocean animals, becomes a career-long question for me.\n\nBut in the short term, the things we’re really trying to get at is, first, that entanglement piece, which you mentioned — what is the lethality of plastic entanglement. And we also just launched a working group with scientists from all over the world to take what we have learned about the lethality of plastic ingestion and to build out, include what we are learning right now in our research about entanglement, and then bring in that exposure piece.\n\nSo that question you asked earlier about how much plastic is a puffin eating, how often does it have a lethal dose — that’s really what we want to get at. We want to know if we have an idea of what’s in the environment, how likely is that to have population-level effects for species? How likely are they to eat a lethal dose? How likely are they to die? And are we worried about populations because of this?\n\nAnd right now, governments around the world are really trying to determine how to effectively address plastic pollution, and these sorts of comprehensive risk assessments are really helpful in setting targets. And so that’s really what I want to keep getting at: How can we take everything we know and help decision makers better understand, you know, a reasonable goal? Because a perfect goal is an ocean with no plastic, and I think we have to keep working towards that collectively. But it’s also really important to understand what species are being adversely affected and what we can do to immediately protect them now.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 35:46\n\nWell, it’s a multi-generational challenge, and I really applaud the work that you’re doing. How can folks keep up with the work that you’re undertaking?\n\nErin Murphy 35:55\n\nYeah, we have a brand new website at oceanconservancy.org, and we have a lot of information there, you know, specifically on what our plastics team is doing, but on what our entire organization is doing in terms of bills that we’re working on. They can also sign up for our newsletter to get information about what the organization is working on, and that will give them ample opportunities to participate in being part of the solution to the plastics crisis.\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 36:20\n\nErin, thanks so much for your time today. It’s been a fascinating conversation and an encouraging one.\n\nErin Murphy 36:26\n\nThank you. It was great to be here.\n\n[COMMERCIAL BREAK]\n\nMitch Ratcliffe 36:34\n\nWelcome back to Sustainability In Your Ear. You’ve been listening to my conversation with Dr. Erin Murphy, manager of ocean plastics research at the Ocean Conservancy, and she’s the lead author of the recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that quantifies, for the first time at this scale, how much plastic it takes to kill seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals.\n\nYou can explore the Ocean Conservancy’s wide-ranging work and sign up for a beach cleanup event at oceanconservancy.org. Ocean Conservancy is all one word, no space, no dash. Oceanconservancy.org.\n\nThe numbers Erin and her colleagues reported should stop us in our tracks. The volumes we heard about are disturbing, but imagine — one in five animals had plastic in their gut when they died. For sea turtles, it was one in two. What makes that study especially useful for policymakers is its differentiation by plastic type. Rubber fragments can be targeted because balloons are the deadliest material for seabirds. Soft plastics like bags are the top killer for sea turtles. Ghost fishing gear poses the greatest risk to marine mammals like whales. And each of these findings points to a specific, actionable policy lever: balloon release bans like Florida’s recent legislation, bag bans like California’s, and better gear-marking and recovery programs for the fishing industry.\n\nBut the targeted approach is only part of the answer. As Erin emphasized, the total plastic thresholds her team found were low across the board, meaning that every type of plastic poses a threat. “At the end of the day,” she said, “there is too much plastic in the ocean, and we need to do sweeping reforms along the entire plastics life cycle, from production to management to disposal.” That’s a very important quote. Keep it in mind.\n\nA 2020 Ocean Conservancy-backed study quantified what “sweeping” means: a 40% reduction in global plastic production, waste management reaching 98 to 99% effectiveness in its collection and processing of plastic so it doesn’t reach nature, and annual cleanups of the 40% of plastic that still escapes into the environment — and that’s just to return to the 2010 leakage rates.\n\nSo that brings us to the elephant in the room — or maybe more to the point, the sperm whale with an entire greenhouse in its stomach — the global plastics treaty negotiations. Which were supposed to deliver a binding international agreement, collapsed in August 2025 in Geneva after oil-producing nations blocked provisions that called for production caps and toxic chemical phase-outs. More than 100 countries in the group known as the High Ambition Coalition were pushing for full life-cycle regulation for plastics, but the requirement that the negotiations reach a consensus gave a handful of petrochemical states an effective veto power. And effective it was.\n\nSo between the Busan round in late 2024 and the end of the Geneva talks in 2025, an estimated 7.4 million more metric tons of plastic entered the ocean. The world currently produces more than 460 million metric tons of plastic annually, and only 9% of that is being recycled. Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks of plastic is dumped into our oceans, rivers, and lakes.\n\nHowever, the collapse of the treaty talks does not mean the end of progress. Erin pointed to evidence that targeted interventions can work. For example, communities in Hawaii conducted large beach cleanups and saw the Hawaiian monk seal population rebound. A study published in Science confirms that bag bans reduce plastic on beaches by between 25 and 47%. California’s SB 54 law aims to cut single-use plastics by 25%. And Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup, which is now in its 40th year, removed more than a million plastic bags from beaches last year. That cleanup data, collected by citizen scientists worldwide, is a research tool providing the time-series evidence that tells us whether policies are working.\n\nSo here’s what I want you to leave with from this conversation. Erin’s research focuses exclusively on acute mortality from ingested macroplastics — that’s obstruction, perforation, and torsion of the digestive tract. It does not capture the chronic effects of plastic and chemical exposure or entanglement, which her team will study next. That means the lethal thresholds that she reported likely underestimate the total harm plastic inflicts on marine life.\n\nAnd the parallel crisis in human health is building from the same source of pollution, which has scattered microscopic shards of plastic across the planet, from the seas to the highest peaks. Most of these microplastics began as macroplastics, like those that are killing puffins and turtles. They break down in the environment into fragments small enough to enter our bloodstream, lungs, liver, and even women’s placentas. As Erin put it, it is all a part of the same crisis.\n\nSo one of the most encouraging things that Erin said was also the simplest. When strangers learn about what she studies, they stop and they tell her what they are doing to reduce their plastic footprint. That instinct to environmental stewardship is a real and powerful phenomenon, even if it’s currently being actively suppressed by governments. And the public’s will to protect nature is the foundation that policy, science, and investment will ultimately build on.\n\nThe ocean doesn’t need our sympathy. It needs a 40% cut in plastic production, waste systems that actually work, and the political will to treat a binding plastics agreement as a matter of human survival rather than an inconvenience for a few petrochemical companies. Until international negotiations deliver that agreement, the work continues at every other level: state legislatures, coastal cleanups, citizen science, and research programs like Erin’s that give decision makers the evidence-based targets that they’ve been asking for.\n\nSo stay tuned, folks, for more conversations about the solutions that can still turn this crisis around.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Every year, more than 11 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the oceans, harming marine animals like seabirds, sea turtles, and whales. Until now, scientists did not know exactly how much plastic it takes to threaten or kill these animals.\n\n**What happened** – Dr. Erin Murphy and her team at the Ocean Conservancy studied over 10,000 dead animals from 95 species worldwide. They measured how much plastic was inside and found specific amounts that increase the chance of death. For example, just three sugar cubes of plastic can raise a puffin’s risk of dying by 90%. The study also showed that different plastics affect animals differently—balloon rubber is especially deadly for seabirds, plastic bags are dangerous to sea turtles, and lost fishing gear harms marine mammals.\n\n**Impact** – This research is the most detailed to date and helps policymakers decide which plastics to target for bans or cleanup efforts. It provides clear evidence that small amounts of plastic can be deadly, meaning broad changes are needed in how plastics are made and managed. The study supports existing laws like California’s plastic bag ban and Florida’s balloon release ban. It also connects ocean plastic pollution to human health risks, as tiny plastic pieces from larger debris end up inside people.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to study how plastic entanglement harms animals and how often animals encounter dangerous amounts of plastic. Policymakers can use this data to set better rules on plastic production and waste. Meanwhile, community cleanups and bans continue to show positive results, like the rebound of Hawaiian monk seals after beach cleanups. The Ocean Conservancy encourages people to join cleanups and stay informed to help reduce ocean plastic.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new global study reveals that even small amounts of ocean plastic can kill marine animals, offering clear targets for policies and community actions to reduce plastic pollution and protect ocean life.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Chaque année, plus de 11 millions de tonnes de plastique sont déversées dans les océans, mettant en danger les animaux marins comme les oiseaux de mer, les tortues et les baleines. Jusqu’à présent, on ne savait pas exactement quelle quantité de plastique peut tuer ces animaux.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Le Dr Erin Murphy et son équipe de l’Ocean Conservancy ont analysé plus de 10 000 animaux morts appartenant à 95 espèces dans le monde. Ils ont mesuré la quantité de plastique ingérée et identifié des seuils précis augmentant le risque de décès. Par exemple, trois morceaux de plastique de la taille de cubes de sucre augmentent de 90 % le risque de mort chez un macareux. L’étude montre aussi que différents plastiques ont des effets variés : le caoutchouc des ballons est particulièrement mortel pour les oiseaux de mer, les sacs plastiques menacent les tortues, et les engins de pêche abandonnés blessent les mammifères marins.\n\n**Impact** – Cette recherche est la plus complète à ce jour et aide les décideurs à cibler les plastiques à interdire ou à nettoyer. Elle prouve que même de petites quantités de plastique sont dangereuses, ce qui nécessite des changements importants dans la production et la gestion des plastiques. L’étude soutient des lois existantes comme l’interdiction des sacs plastiques en Californie et celle des lâchers de ballons en Floride. Elle relie aussi la pollution plastique marine aux risques pour la santé humaine, car les microplastiques issus des débris plus grands se retrouvent dans le corps humain.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques vont étudier les effets de l’enchevêtrement dans les plastiques et la fréquence à laquelle les animaux rencontrent des quantités dangereuses de plastique. Les décideurs peuvent utiliser ces données pour mieux réguler la production et la gestion des déchets plastiques. En attendant, les nettoyages communautaires et les interdictions montrent des résultats positifs, comme le retour en force des phoques moines d’Hawaï après des nettoyages de plages. L’Ocean Conservancy encourage les gens à participer aux nettoyages et à s’informer pour réduire la pollution plastique.\n\n**En résumé** – Une nouvelle étude mondiale montre que de petites quantités de plastique océanique peuvent tuer la faune marine, fournissant des objectifs clairs pour les politiques et les actions communautaires visant à réduire la pollution plastique et protéger la vie marine.\n",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Cada año, más de 11 millones de toneladas de plástico llegan a los océanos, afectando a animales marinos como aves marinas, tortugas y ballenas. Hasta ahora, no se sabía con exactitud cuánto plástico es suficiente para poner en peligro o matar a estos animales.\n\n**Qué pasó** – La Dra. Erin Murphy y su equipo en Ocean Conservancy estudiaron más de 10,000 animales muertos de 95 especies en todo el mundo. Midieron la cantidad de plástico en sus cuerpos y encontraron cantidades específicas que aumentan el riesgo de muerte. Por ejemplo, solo tres cubos de azúcar de plástico aumentan en un 90% la probabilidad de muerte de un frailecillo. El estudio también mostró que diferentes tipos de plástico afectan a distintas especies: el caucho de los globos es muy mortal para las aves marinas, las bolsas plásticas son peligrosas para las tortugas y el equipo de pesca perdido daña a los mamíferos marinos.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta investigación es la más detallada hasta ahora y ayuda a los responsables de políticas a decidir qué plásticos deben prohibirse o limpiarse. Demuestra que incluso pequeñas cantidades de plástico pueden ser mortales, lo que requiere cambios importantes en la producción y manejo de plásticos. El estudio apoya leyes existentes como la prohibición de bolsas plásticas en California y la prohibición de lanzamiento de globos en Florida. También relaciona la contaminación plástica oceánica con riesgos para la salud humana, ya que los microplásticos provenientes de estos residuos terminan dentro del cuerpo humano.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos planean estudiar cómo el enredo en plásticos afecta a los animales y con qué frecuencia enfrentan cantidades peligrosas de plástico. Los responsables de políticas pueden usar estos datos para crear mejores reglas sobre producción y gestión de residuos plásticos. Mientras tanto, las limpiezas comunitarias y las prohibiciones continúan mostrando resultados positivos, como la recuperación de las focas monje de Hawái tras limpiezas en las playas. Ocean Conservancy anima a las personas a participar en limpiezas y mantenerse informadas para ayudar a reducir el plástico en el océano.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Un nuevo estudio global revela que incluso pequeñas cantidades de plástico oceánico pueden matar a la vida marina, ofreciendo objetivos claros para políticas y acciones comunitarias que reduzcan la contaminación plástica y protejan la vida en el océano.\n",
