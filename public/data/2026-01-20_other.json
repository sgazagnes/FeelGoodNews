      "title": "Why a tool-using cow could change how we see farm animals",
      "summary": "A pet cow has learned to scratch herself with a broom, showing creative problem-solving skills that make it harder to ignore the fact that these animals have minds, says Marta Halina",
      "content": "A pet cow has learned to scratch herself with a broom, showing creative problem-solving skills that make it harder to ignore the fact that these animals have minds, says Marta Halina\n\nVeronika the cow is the first recorded non-primate mammal to demonstrate flexible, multi-purpose tool use Antonio J. Osuna Mascaró\n\nA few years ago, during a taxi ride, the driver described to me how a pig had transformed his life. A childhood with dogs taught him what to expect from animals, yet he was unprepared for the pig he had taken in as a favour.\n\nThe man told me how he had rigged a string-and-bell system by the door so the animals could signal when they wanted to go outside. Both the dogs and pig learned to do this, but the pig took it a step further: she began ringing the bell to alert the man when a dog was outside waiting to get back in. He had many examples like this, told with pride and affection. At the end of our conversation, I asked whether these experiences had changed his food preferences. They had: he no longer eats pork.\n\nThe taxi driver’s experience mirrors a growing trend in how we study the mental lives of other species. For a long time, when scientists looked for cognitive traits comparable to our own, they focused almost exclusively on non-human primates or the “feathered apes” – clever birds such as parrots and crows. More recently, researchers have expanded their focus to include a much more diverse array of species, such as bees, octopuses and crocodiles.\n\nIn line with this trend, a new study by Antonio Osuna-Mascaró and Alice Auersperg, both at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna in Austria, examines the cognitive capacities of an animal we often overlook: the cow. Veronika, a pet cow (Bos taurus), expertly wields a broom to scratch herself. She uses the bristled end to scratch her back but then flips the tool to use the smoother stick end for her more sensitive underside.\n\nThe researchers describe this as the first recorded instance of flexible, multi-purpose tool use in a non-primate mammal. What does this tool use reveal about the minds of cows, and will it change how we treat them?\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nBroadly defined, tool use is the act of manipulating an object so that its motion directly achieves a goal. This definition excludes behaviours such as nest building or seeking cover underground; while materials are moved to construct a nest, the objects function as a static structure once in place. In tool use, the movement itself is the mechanism of success – whether this involves using a rock to crack a nut or wiggling a twig to fish termites from a mound.\n\nScholars once thought tool use was a uniquely human trait. Jane Goodall changed this in the 1960s when she first observed a chimpanzee she had named David Greybeard fashioning and using a tool for termite fishing. Decades later, tool use has been discovered in unexpected corners of the animal kingdom.\n\nDoodlebugs, the larvae of antlions, throw sand at prey, while certain digger wasps use pebbles to tamp down their burrows. However, these are highly specialised behaviours that emerged through millions of years of evolution. The cognition underlying these stereotyped actions is different from the flexible tool use that emerges spontaneously in some animals to solve a problem. Veronika’s use of the broom falls into this latter category.\n\nVeronika uses different ends of the broom to scratch different parts of her body Antonio J. Osuna Mascaró\n\nVeronika was never taught to use tools. This behaviour emerged spontaneously, starting with the use of small twigs when she was young and progressing to the flexible deployment of a multi-purpose broom.\n\nHer behaviour suggests that she has what the psychologist Josep Call identifies as the three ingredients of a creative tool user. First, she gathers information by learning the physical properties of objects. Second, she combines this knowledge to solve problems, recognising that a rigid object can reach an itch that is otherwise inaccessible. Finally, she has a propensity to manipulate objects. This trait is important because physical capacity alone is not enough. While squirrel monkeys and capuchin monkeys have similar hands, only the latter is disposed to manipulate objects.\n\nWill learning more about the minds of cows and other livestock change how we treat them? Research by psychologists suggests that it could. In one study, when asked to rate the mental capacities and edibility of various animals, participants tended to rate those with less of a mind as more edible and those with more of a mind as less edible. In another study, participants were introduced to a species called Bennett’s tree kangaroo. Those who were told the animal was a food source viewed it as being less capable of suffering and less worthy of moral concern than those who were told the animal lived in the wild.\n\nThe way we treat animals is strongly correlated to the minds we believe they possess. Veronika’s story is likely the first of many to challenge our perception of “simple-minded” livestock. Yet, for this knowledge to be transformative, we must address our own cognitive dissonance. Denying that animals have minds protects us from the reality of how we treat them. It’s easier to ignore a mind than it is to respect one.\n\nMarta Halina is a professor of philosophy of science at the University of Cambridge",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have often studied clever animals like monkeys and birds to understand animal intelligence. But cows, which many people see only as farm animals, have not been studied much for their mental skills.\n\n**What happened** – A pet cow named Veronika learned to use a broom to scratch different parts of her body.

      "summary": "Nature, Published online: 19 January 2026; doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04061-wIf we don’t slow down, the research enterprise is going to crash, argues Adrian Barnett.",
      "content": "Credit: Getty\n\nIn my fourth year as a postdoctoral researcher, in 2005, I published ten papers. This was an enormous output for one year. At that rate, I reflected, I could publish 100 papers in a decade. Nevertheless, a century still seemed a remote and unattainable score, something that only the most distinguished professors were likely to achieve before they retired.\n\nFast forward two decades, and ten papers per year now looks pedestrian when you consider the growing number of hyper-prolific authors who publish more than 60 papers annually1 — one or more papers a week.\n\nI have always felt the pressure to publish more. In 2005, my head of department often exalted a professor who published around 40 papers a year; those of us working in public health were all encouraged to do the same. The target was numbers, and quality was mentioned only in terms of a journal’s prestige, never the work itself.\n\n‘Radical change’\n\nI’ve decided to push back on the pressure to publish by making a rule for myself: I will no longer publish more than seven papers per year. I’ve published a median of 15 papers a year for the past five years, so that means I will have to halve my output.\n\nSeven is my own threshold, and will have no relevance to most other researchers, especially those in other fields or at different career stages. The purpose of setting a number is only to aid the goal of prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\nI am not going to spend less time on research, or contribute to 15 papers per year and then select the best 7, so this change will double the amount of time I spend on each paper. I’ll use that time to craft better papers, doing more background reading, more consultation with stakeholders and more model testing, and giving more consideration to what the results mean for public health in practice.\n\nI am making this change because I think the current publication system is a runaway train that is headed for disaster. Publication numbers are ballooning, with more than 1.7 million indexed articles appearing on the PubMed database for 2024, compared with around 1.2 million for 2014. This inflation was recently described as “unsustainable” by Cambridge University Press, UK, which called for “radical change”. The boom in numbers is putting the publication system under enormous strain2, and it is now impossible for scientists to thoroughly read and peer review the literature. Without adequate scrutiny, the overall quality of research seems to be degrading, with a recent explosion in the number of low-quality papers passing peer review3.\n\nAs a professor with a permanent contract, it’s much easier for me to make radical changes than it is for early-career researchers, who are competing to win jobs and funding. Too many career decisions are based on CV length rather than quality, which maintains the pressure on researchers to publish as many papers as possible. Some researchers have reacted to this pressure by using shortcuts to boost their CVs, including using large language models (LLMs) to write low-quality papers and buying ready-made papers from paper mills.\n\nI’m not the first to suggest that less is more in publishing. In Nature in 2017, there was a call for a lifetime word limit for all scientists, and there is a growing ‘slow science’ movement. Alas, speed is still more prized than rigour, because those who publish first get more kudos than do those who publish carefully.",

      "title": "Meet Filip Ondrušek, the Austrian-Slavic chef who believes that local food reflects national history",
      "summary": "“Modern reinterpretation of traditional dishes can maintain technical excellence while preserving the emotion, identity, and memories embedded in the food.”",
      "content": "Filip Ondrušek is an internationally recognized chef, ecologist and activist with Austrian and Slavic roots, who combines his interest in culture and food identity with his extensive experience in high-end gastronomy and sustainable practices. At just 29 years old, he is currently based in São Paulo, Brazil, having lived in various locations and visited over 30 countries — across and beyond Europe — collaborating with top global chefs and restaurants.\n\n\n\nHe has served as a creative chef in both two- and three-Michelin-starred restaurants, designing innovative culinary concepts that merge tradition and modernity. Among others, these prestigious restaurants have included Central (Peru), Koks (Faroe Islands), Amador (Austria), Brae (Australia), Narisawa (Japan), Azurmendi (Spain), Alo (Canada), Smyth (USA), and Alto (Venezuela). Despite such international experience, however, he never forgets his cultural roots and remains deeply interested in cultural and food traditions in central and southeastern Europe.\n\nIn Autumn 2025, Ondrušek was an honorary guest at Bulgaria's Traditional Cheese Festival. He is known for unique flavor combinations and a signature approach that merges classical and traditional techniques with modern creativity. Following Slow Food and Demeter principles and using biodynamic and seasonal ingredients, he creates dishes that respect the integrity of the products.\n\nNevena Borisova (NB): How would you differentiate the Austrian and Slavic cultures and their culinary traditions?\n\nFilip Ondrušek (FO): Austrian and Slavic cultures differ in their culinary expressions, yet they complement each other beautifully. Austrian cuisine is structured, precise, and deeply influenced by courtly traditions, craftsmanship, and a focus on technique. There is a clear hierarchy of flavors, and every detail — from preparation to presentation — is intentional. Precision and methodical execution are highly valued. Slavic tradition, on the other hand, is more intuitive, emotive, and deeply connected to family, local ingredients, and everyday life. Recipes were often born from what was available rather than rigid instructions, carrying strong cultural and emotional significance. The flavor is as much about memory and identity as it is about technique. For me, the most fascinating aspect is bridging these worlds — merging Austrian precision with Slavic emotional authenticity. Modern reinterpretation of traditional dishes can maintain technical excellence while preserving the emotion, identity, and memories embedded in the food.\n\nNB: What shared cultural specifics and culinary traditions have you noticed across countries and continents?\n\nFO: Through my travels, I have observed that despite geographic and ethnic differences, there are universal values in gastronomy. One of the strongest is respect for ingredients and seasonality. Traditional cuisines, whether in Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, or Latin America, developed from the availability of local produce, with careful attention to nature and minimizing waste. Another universal value is the social and familial dimension of food. Recipes are passed down not merely as technical instructions but as carriers of culture, emotion and identity. Food holds the memory of generations and creates a sense of belonging. This ties closely to history, as food becomes a living document of a society's past. From a culinary perspective, many techniques are universal: fermentation, curing, smoking, pickling, and slow cooking emerged independently worldwide as practical responses to preserving food and maximizing ingredient usage. These principles remain highly relevant today and form the foundation of authentic, sustainable cuisine. In Central and Eastern Europe, I see particular emphasis on hospitality, the heartiness of meals, and family-centered dining. These principles resonate with many other global cuisines, showing that while forms differ, the underlying values are strikingly similar. Understanding these common layers allows me to work with both local and global perspectives, balancing tradition and modern culinary expression.\n\nNB: If national history is reflected in food traditions, how has it influenced Central and Eastern European cuisine?\n\nFO: I firmly believe that national history is one of the most powerful forces shaping food traditions. Cuisine acts as a living document, responding to wars, migrations, political shifts, economic crises, and periods of abundance. In Central and Eastern Europe, this historical imprint is particularly tangible. Many traditional recipes were born out of necessity, shaped by available resources and survival needs. Root vegetables, fermented foods, potatoes and cabbage became staples, carrying the memory and identity of entire regions. The Austro-Hungarian Empire left a shared culinary heritage, evident in dumplings, pastries, sauces, and meat preparation techniques. Later political regimes simplified dishes and suppressed regional diversity, further shaping culinary identity. History imprints itself systematically, not randomly. As a chef, I strive to understand these layers, working with them so that the dishes I create not only taste remarkable but also tell the story of place, people, and generational knowledge. Modern interpretation can preserve authenticity and emotion while giving food a contemporary language.\n\nNB: How did socialism affect local food traditions and recipes? What were the positives and negatives?\n\nFO: Socialism had a significant and dual impact on gastronomy. On the positive side, it fostered resourcefulness, teaching people to cook efficiently, use every part of an ingredient, and create satisfying meals with limited resources. These practices — seasonal cooking, minimal waste, and home-based culinary creativity — remain relevant today, especially in the context of sustainability and zero-waste approaches. On the negative side, socialism led to homogenized flavors, centralized production, and a suppression of regional diversity. Many local recipes were simplified or lost their original character. Culinary creativity was often limited, and the richness of regional gastronomy was diminished. Overall, the positives and negatives were relatively balanced. The system left a strong culture of practical, resource-conscious cooking, but weakened regional uniqueness and culinary diversity. Today, chefs face the challenge of preserving the valuable lessons while reviving local identity, creativity, and depth.\n\nFO: From my perspective, the balance between tradition and modernity is at the core of contemporary cuisine. The flavors of childhood — the tastes and memories associated with meals from parents or grandparents — form the mental and emotional foundation for understanding food. These flavors carry cultural identity, history, and emotion, which must never be lost in reinterpretation. Modern techniques, innovative presentations, and new culinary approaches can enhance traditional dishes, but they should never overshadow the original intent or essence. A dish should evoke emotion and familiarity while speaking in a contemporary language. Achieving this balance requires understanding of ingredients, techniques, and the cultural context of each recipe. In practice, this means carefully analyzing traditional recipes, identifying their core identity — be it a texture, flavor profile, or emotional resonance — and then thoughtfully integrating modern elements. Whether through sous-vide precision, new plating aesthetics, or molecular techniques, the goal is to honor tradition while creating a meaningful, sensory experience for today’s diners.\n\nNB: Has part of local food authenticity has been lost due to modernization, fast food, etc.?\n\nFO: I believe that modernization and the global spread of fast food have contributed to a measurable loss of authenticity in local cuisine. Fast food promotes convenience over connection to ingredients, process, and memory. While it meets certain societal needs, it often diminishes the value of traditions and the emotional depth associated with home-prepared meals.\n\nNB: Can we somehow use the modernization for good?",
