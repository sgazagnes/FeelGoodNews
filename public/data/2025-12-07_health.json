      "title": "Natural hormone unlocks a hidden fat burning switch",
      "summary": "FGF19 triggers the brain to burn more energy and activate fat-burning cells, offering a potential new path for obesity treatments. The hormone enhances thermogenesis and reduces inflammation, but only when the sympathetic nervous system is active. Researchers uncovered how cold exposure increases receptor expression for FGF19 in the hypothalamus, hinting at an evolutionary role in temperature regulation. Ongoing work aims to discover how to boost natural production of this powerful metabolic hormone.",
      "content": "Studies in mice have shown that a hormone produced in the intestine can send signals to the brain and influence how much energy the body uses. This hormone, called FGF19 (fibroblast growth factor 19), activates processes that help the body spend more energy, use stored fat as fuel, and improve weight control and blood glucose levels in obese animals.\n\nResearchers linked these effects to the action of FGF19 in the hypothalamus, a key brain region that receives information from the rest of the body and the environment to coordinate energy metabolism. They found that when FGF19 signals in the hypothalamus, it boosts the activity of thermogenic adipocytes (i.e., fat cells that burn energy to produce heat), which are specialized fat cells that help the body generate heat instead of storing calories.\n\nNew Paths for Obesity and Diabetes Treatments\n\nBecause of these findings, the scientists believe that FGF19 could inspire new medications for obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic conditions. The idea is to develop compounds that imitate the behavior of natural substances in the body, mimicking the action of endogenous compounds (i.e. those produced by the body itself).\n\nThis strategy resembles the way some of the latest diabetes and obesity drugs work. Ozempic, for example, contains semaglutide, an ingredient that activates receptors mimicking the hormone GLP-1. By doing so, it sends satiety signals to the brain and helps patients feel full with less food.\n\nAccording to the study, FGF19 did more than change appetite or fat storage. The hormone also lowered peripheral inflammation and improved the animals' tolerance to cold. When the researchers blocked the sympathetic nervous system, however, these benefits disappeared. In further experiments, they observed that exposure to cold increased the expression of FGF19 receptors in the hypothalamus. Because the hypothalamus is crucial for maintaining body temperature, these results suggest that FGF19 may help the body adapt by coordinating energy balance and thermoregulation.\n\nFGF19, Thermogenesis, and Brain Control of Energy\n\n\"FGF19 had already been linked to a reduction in food intake. Our work broke new ground by showing that it also plays an important role by acting on the hypothalamus and stimulating an increase in energy expenditure in white and brown adipose tissue. In other words, in addition to controlling appetite, it stimulates thermogenesis. So, in terms of therapy associated with obesity, it'd make a lot of sense,\" explains Professor Helena Cristina de Lima Barbosa, from the Obesity and Comorbidities Research Center (OCRC) at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).\n\nThe OCRC is a Research, Innovation, and Dissemination Center (RIDC) of FAPESP, which also funded the project through grants to doctoral student Lucas Zangerolamo, the first author of the study, supervised by Barbosa.\n\nThe work has been described in detail in an article published in the American Journal of Physiology -- Endocrinology and Metabolism, where it was highlighted as a Top Article in May.\n\nGlobal Obesity Crisis and Urgent Health Targets\n\nThe World Atlas of Obesity 2025 warns that, if current trends continue, global health goals for this year will not be met. These targets include halting the rise in diabetes and obesity and cutting premature deaths from cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer by 25%, using 2010 as the reference year.\n\nThe Atlas estimates that more than 1 billion people worldwide are currently living with obesity. If effective actions are not put in place, this number could surpass 1.5 billion by 2030. Obesity is already associated with about 1.6 million premature deaths each year from non-communicable diseases.\n\nIn Brazil, around 31% of the population has obesity. In addition, between 40% and 50% of adults do not reach the recommended levels of physical activity in terms of frequency or intensity.\n\nWhere FGF19 Comes From and How It Works\n\nFGF19, which is involved in the control of energy metabolism, is mainly produced in the small intestine. In the liver, it regulates the production of bile acids and also influences the synthesis of glucose and fats. While its primary roles in the liver have been widely explored in scientific literature, its effects in the brain have received much less attention.\n\n\"In the lab, we work with bile acids, which are also the subject of my master's degree, and they regulate the release of FGF-19. Our initial studies led us down this path,\" Zangerolamo told Agência FAPESP.\n\nAt eight weeks of age, the mice used in the study were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received a standard diet (control) and the other was fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity. The researchers then administered FGF19 directly into the brains of the obese animals. All mice were kept in carefully controlled conditions of temperature, lighting, and access to water.\n\nIn the article, the scientists report that central FGF19 signaling improved energy homeostasis. It did this by boosting the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and stimulating thermogenesis in adipose tissue, leading the tissue to consume more energy in the form of heat.\n\n\"The brain plays an extremely important role in controlling the body's adiposity. At the same time as it receives information from peripheral tissues, it triggers commands. These commands, apparently using the sympathetic nervous system, seem to be an interesting way of thinking about energy expenditure,\" adds Barbosa.\n\nDigging Deeper Into Brain Cells and FGF19 Receptors\n\nTo better understand which brain cells respond to FGF19, the authors compiled and examined public scRNA-seq data from several studies of the hypothalamus. This method makes it possible to sequence RNA from individual cells, revealing which genes are active in each cell type. In total, the team evaluated transcription from more than 50,000 single cells to identify hypothalamic cell populations that express FGF19 receptors.\n\nThe researchers note that a key question now is how to encourage the body to produce more FGF19 on its own. They are also working to connect these findings with what is already known about the neural circuits that regulate eating behavior.\n\n\"We want to broaden this understanding. We're studying the hypothalamus to evaluate the inflammation commonly observed when a high-fat diet is administered and whether FGF19 plays a role in this area,\" says Zangerolamo, who did part of the work during an internship at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School with Professor Yu-Hua Tseng, who is also an author of the article.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Obesity is a growing health problem worldwide, with over 1 billion people affected and many struggling to control their weight. Scientists are searching for new ways to help the body burn fat and manage energy better.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers studied a hormone called FGF19, made in the intestine, and found it sends signals to the brain’s hypothalamus. This signal activates special fat cells that burn energy to produce heat, a process called thermogenesis. In tests with mice, giving FGF19 directly to the brain helped obese animals burn more fat, lower inflammation, and handle cold better. These effects depended on the sympathetic nervous system, which controls automatic body functions.\n\n**Impact** – The discovery shows FGF19 can do more than reduce appetite; it also increases how much energy the body uses by activating fat-burning cells. This opens a new path for creating medicines to treat obesity and diabetes by mimicking or boosting this natural hormone’s action. It also connects the body’s response to cold with energy control, revealing how the brain helps balance weight and temperature.\n\n**What’s next step** – Scientists want to learn how to raise the body’s own production of FGF19 and understand how it affects brain cells that control eating and metabolism. Future research will explore if this hormone can reduce inflammation caused by unhealthy diets and how it might be used safely in humans.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The natural hormone FGF19 signals the brain to burn fat and increase energy use, offering new hope for obesity and diabetes treatments.\n",

      "title": "Scientists find hidden layers in brain’s memory center",
      "summary": "Scientists uncovered a surprising four-layer structure hidden inside the hippocampal CA1 region, one of the brain’s major centers for memory, navigation, and emotion. Using advanced RNA imaging techniques, the team mapped more than 330,000 genetic signals from tens of thousands of neurons, revealing crisp, shifting bands of cell types that run along the length of the hippocampus. This layered organization may help explain why different parts of CA1 support different behaviors and why certain neurons break down more easily in disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy.",
      "content": "Researchers at the Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute (Stevens INI) at the Keck School of Medicine of USC have uncovered a previously unrecognized organizational pattern in one of the brain's key regions for learning and memory. According to findings reported in Nature Communications, the CA1 section of a mouse's hippocampus contains four separate layers of specialized cell types. The hippocampus plays an essential role in forming memories, guiding spatial navigation, and influencing emotions, and the discovery of these layers offers new insight into how information moves through this part of the brain. It also provides clues about why some cell types are especially vulnerable in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy.\n\n\"Researchers have long suspected that different parts of the hippocampus' CA1 region handle different aspects of learning and memory, but it wasn't clear how the underlying cells were arranged,\" said Michael S. Bienkowski, PhD, senior author of the study and assistant professor of physiology and neuroscience and of biomedical engineering.\n\n\"Our study shows that CA1 neurons are organized into four thin, continuous bands, each representing a different neuron type defined by a unique molecular signature. These layers aren't fixed in place; instead, they subtly shift and change in thickness along the length of the hippocampus. This shifting pattern means that each part of CA1 contains its own mix of neuron types, which helps explain why different regions support different behaviors. This may also clarify why certain CA1 neurons are more vulnerable in conditions like Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy: if a disease targets one layer's cell type, the effects will vary depending on where in CA1 that layer is most prominent.\"\n\nHigh-resolution RNA imaging reveals cellular distinctions\n\nTo examine this structure, the research team used an RNA labeling technique called RNAscope together with high-resolution microscopy. This approach allowed them to observe single-molecule gene expression inside mouse CA1 tissue and identify individual neuron types based on their active genes. From 58.065 CA1 pyramidal cells, the scientists recorded more than 330,000 RNA molecules, which represent the genetic instructions that indicate when and where genes are expressed. By mapping these gene activity patterns, they produced a detailed cellular atlas outlining the boundaries between distinct nerve cell types across the CA1 region.\n\nTheir results showed that CA1 contains four continuous layers of nerve cells, each distinguished by its own pattern of active genes. When viewed in three dimensions, these layers form sheet-like structures that vary in thickness and shape along the hippocampus. This well-defined arrangement clarifies earlier studies that had described CA1 as a more blended or mosaic mixture of cell types.\n\nHidden \"stripes\" highlight internal brain architecture\n\n\"When we visualized gene RNA patterns at single-cell resolution, we could see clear stripes, like geological layers in rock, each representing a distinct neuron type,\" said Maricarmen Pachicano, doctoral researcher at the Stevens INI's Center for Integrative Connectomics and co-first author of the paper. \"It's like lifting a veil on the brain's internal architecture. These hidden layers may explain differences in how hippocampal circuits support learning and memory.\"\n\nBecause the hippocampus is one of the first regions affected in Alzheimer's disease and is involved in epilepsy, depression, and other neurological conditions, identifying the CA1's layered structure offers a promising guide for determining which neuron types may be most at risk as these disorders progress.\n\nAdvancing brain mapping with modern imaging and data science\n\n\"Discoveries like this exemplify how modern imaging and data science can transform our view of brain anatomy,\" said Arthur W. Toga, PhD, director of the Stevens INI and the Ghada Irani Chair in Neuroscience at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. \"This work builds on the Stevens INI's long tradition of mapping the brain at every scale, from molecules to whole networks, and will inform both basic neuroscience and translational studies targeting memory and cognition.\"\n\nA new CA1 cell-type atlas available to researchers\n\nThe team compiled its findings into a new CA1 cell-type atlas using data from the Hippocampus Gene Expression Atlas (HGEA). This resource is freely available to scientists worldwide and includes interactive 3D visualizations accessible through the Schol-AR augmented-reality app developed at the Stevens INI. The tool allows researchers to explore the layered structure of the hippocampus in great detail.\n\nBecause this layered pattern in mice resembles similar arrangements seen in primates and humans, including comparable variations in CA1 thickness, the researchers believe the organization may be shared across many mammalian species. Further work is needed to determine how closely this structure in humans matches what has been observed in mice, but the findings create a strong starting point for future studies examining how hippocampal architecture supports memory and cognition.\n\n\"Understanding how these layers connect to behavior is the next frontier,\" Bienkowski said. \"We now have a framework to study how specific neuron layers contribute to such different functions like memory, navigation, and emotion, and how their disruption may lead to disease.\"\n\nAbout the study\n\nIn addition to Bienkowski and Pachicano, the study's other authors include Shrey Mehta, Angela Hurtado, Tyler Ard, Jim Stanis, and Bayla Breningstall.\n\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Aging (K01AG066847, R36AG087310-01, supplement P30-AG066530-03S1), National Science Foundation (grant 2121164), and funding from the USC Center for Neuronal Longevity.

      "content": "Many childhood vaccines contain small amounts of aluminium to boost the immune response. Credit: Getty When US vaccine advisers meet this week, they will turn their spotlight on little-known ingredients that are crucial to the effectiveness of many vaccines: adjuvants.\n\nAdjuvants are compounds that boost immune responses, improving the ability of vaccines to elicit long-lasting immunity against infectious diseases. At this week’s meeting, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is expected to discuss aluminium, an adjuvant widely used in inoculations against diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B, among others. Over the past century, hundreds of millions of people have received vaccines containing small amounts of aluminium as an adjuvant.\n\nBut researchers are also racing to develop new adjuvants that can stimulate the immune responses needed to combat specific pathogens. Such adjuvants could prove crucial to the success of the next generation of vaccines against diseases including tuberculosis and malaria, and against viruses such as HIV, says Darrell Irvine, a vaccine immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.\n\n“These are huge global health issues,” he says. “And adjuvants are likely going to be part of the solution.”\n\nVaccines’ little helpers\n\nAdjuvants can work in different ways. Some adjuvants trigger low levels of inflammation at the injection site, thereby boosting recruitment of immune cells to where they are needed and encouraging the cells to linger there. Others are more specific, activating molecular signalling pathways in certain classes of immune cells.\n\nAluminium is in the first category, and its vaccine-boosting properties have been known for more than a century, says Irvine. Decades of use and scrutiny by regulators have clearly established that the benefits of using aluminium adjuvants outweigh any potential risks, says Marco Cavaleri, head of public-health threats at the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\nPsychedelics and immortality: Nature went to a health summit starring RFK and JD Vance\n\nEven so, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has long campaigned against vaccines, has argued that aluminium adjuvants are linked to autism and food allergies. In July, researchers in Denmark published a study of more than one million children that found no such link1. Kennedy called for the study to be retracted; the journal declined.\n\nThe ACIP advisers, handpicked by Kennedy, will discuss the use of aluminium in vaccines this week, but they have not yet scheduled a vote. Any requirement to eliminate aluminium would be a shock to the system, says Cavaleri, and would render some crucial vaccines ineffective. “You cannot just get rid of an adjuvant that works and is safe before you have something else that you know will be a good replacement,” he says.\n\nGetting specific",
