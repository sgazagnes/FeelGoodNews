      "content": "'Do you have a girlfriend yet?': Pupils open time capsule letters to self\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Kristian Johnson BBC News Share Save\n\nWatch: 'I am still happy and I still want to be successful'\n\nFour years ago, with the UK beginning to emerge from its latest Covid-19 lockdown, teacher Damaris Bateson asked her new intake of Year 7 students to write letters to their future selves. In the letters which they opened ahead of sitting their exams, they pondered what the world would look like by the time they sat their GCSEs. Would face masks still be needed? Would they achieve their hopes and dreams? For then 11-year-old Charlie, there was one question at the forefront of his mind.\n\n\"A childish question, but do you have a girlfriend yet?\" Now 16, Charlie blushes as he reads his letter back. On Thursday, he will be among of hundreds of thousands of students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to receive their GCSE results. It marks a significant milestone in their education after years of disruption from the pandemic. Despite the challenges she faced at the time she began secondary school, Vanessa wrote about her hopes of studying at Columbia University in New York. \"Don't let nobody [sic] distract you from your studies, but also don't forget to have fun.\"\n\nVanessa wrote a letter to herself during the pandemic which also said \"Never stop trying\"\n\nVanessa sheepishly admits she used to argue with her teachers when she started at secondary school \"because I didn't get my own way\". \"But I respect everyone now,\" she says as she breaks out into a beaming smile. \"I realise I'm not the only person in this world.\" Classmate Eve told her future self to \"tell your grandma and grandad you love them every day\". \"Remember you are loved and continue doing great,\" she wrote. \"Don't be negative, think positive and become successful.\" Eve's letter ends with two questions, each with a tick box for yes or no. \"Are you still happy?\" and \"Do you still want to be successful?\" Four years on, her unwavering positivity remains. \"Absolutely\", she says, confidently tapping her fingertip against the boxes marked 'Y'. The letters were written on 12 March 2021, the second day back in school after the latest lengthy lockdown. Head of Year Miss Bateson asked her pupils to write the time capsule letters after realising her pupils' transition from primary school to secondary school had been \"really disrupted\".\n\nDamaris Bateson has been head of year for the current cohort of Year 11 students at her London school since September 2020\n\n\"A lot of them had been out of school for months at that point,\" she says. \"It was quite an isolating experience.\" Charlie's letter described how he was \"scared I'll test positive out of nowhere\", while classmate Fisayomi wrote how \"it was tough not seeing friends and family\". \"Right now the world is not so good,\" Fisayomi said in 2021. \"By the time I am in in Year 11 I hope it [Covid] is gone.\" He is now back doing what he loves, playing football with his friends Gabriel and Daniel, who he's known since he was three years old. But the entire secondary school education of this year's GCSE cohort was shaped by the impact of the pandemic. First, they spent months learning from home. Then they returned to school in 'bubbles', with restrictions on which parts of the school building they could enter and who they could socialise with.\n\nFisayomi says they would spend entire days \"just sitting in the same room\". \"You'd have the same classroom for every subject. You wouldn't move for the whole day.\" In some classrooms, windows were left open to reduce the risk of infection. \"Everyone was wearing their coats because it was freezing,\" says Charlie. \"It was just strange.\" They weren't alone. Schools across the UK had to adapt to ever-changing Covid restrictions throughout 2020 and 2021. Reflecting now, Fisayomi says his year group showed \"perseverance\" to adjust to life at secondary school in the midst of a pandemic. \"It was hard to keep going and going,\" he says. Next month, the Covid-19 Inquiry will explore the impact of the pandemic on children and young people.\n\nVanessa, Eve, Fisayomi and Charlie all started secondary school in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In 2021, when schools were reopening after a long Covid-19 lockdown in the UK, a teacher at a London secondary school asked new Year 7 students to write letters to their future selves. These letters were meant to be opened four years later, just before the students took their important GCSE exams.\n\n**What happened** – This week, the students, now aged 16 and about to receive their GCSE results, read the letters they wrote as 11-year-olds. The letters included personal hopes and questions about their lives and the world, such as whether Covid restrictions would still be in place or if they would achieve their dreams. For example, one student, Charlie, asked his future self if he had a girlfriend yet, while Vanessa reminded herself to stay focused and have fun.\n\n**Impact** – These letters show how students faced the challenges of the pandemic with honesty and hope. They reveal how young people experienced isolation, fear, and change, but also how they grew and stayed positive. The activity helped students reflect on their feelings during a difficult time and see how much they have changed. It also highlights the importance of supporting young people through tough times.\n\n**What's next step** – The students will soon receive their GCSE results, an important moment after years disrupted by Covid. Additionally, a government inquiry will soon examine how the pandemic affected children and young people, which may lead to better support for students in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Writing letters to their future selves helped London students reflect on their growth and resilience through the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic as they approach a key exam milestone.",

      "content": "Yellow stickers and fridge hacks: How to feed children for less in the holidays\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Colletta Smith Cost of living correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe school summer holidays means many parents face the task of cooking up lunches and snacks for children eating most of their meals at home for six weeks. It can prove costly especially as food prices are rising faster now than at any point in the last year. School dinners are often subsidised so doing it yourself can get pricey. Some parents have shared how meticulous planning and creative cooking has been helping them keep their shopping bill down.\n\nFill your freezer with yellow-sticker food\n\nEvelyn stocks up her freezer with discounted food\n\nFor mum-of-two Evelyn buying reduced items is key. \"I'm not afraid of a yellow sticker, especially for my meat, that's what your freezer is for,\" she says. At home in Gorton, in East Manchester, she's been preparing for the summer holidays for months, buying reduced items to pop in the freezer and use when there are more mouths in the house to feed. She has a 12-year-old daughter who gets free school meals during term time and a 19-year-old son who's back home from university for the holidays. \"The snacking is immense,\" she says. But like Colette, she's determined not to waste anything. \"When you've got things going off, try and make something else out of them. Dip fruit into yoghurts, bang them in the freezer and you've got nice little frozen berry yoghurt snacks.\" Evelyn receives a £50 voucher to help with the cost of summer holiday food from Manchester City Council issued by her daughter's school. She says they are a \"big help\", particularly as they are not tied to one supermarket, so she can shop around for the best deals.\n\nFood prices increased by 4.5% compared to June last year, and it's expected the next set of official figures will show a further rise in July and August. Benefit payments went up in April and after taking inflation into account, average wages grew by 1.5% between April and June. But rent and mortgages rises, as well as increases in the cost of summer holiday clubs or childcare means many families say they aren't feeling any better off.\n\nPut food for each day in a seperate bag\n\nLaura Maggs plans her meals and puts each one in a seperate bag\n\nLaura is out of work at the moment and has three children who she describes as \"eating machines\" who receive free school meals during term time. But in the school holidays \"sometimes we've got plenty of food, and sometimes we don't, so you have to get creative,\" she says. Her tactic is to see what food she has, and put it into separate bags for each day, to help make sure the food lasts all week. She says putting food in high kitchen cupboards - out of reach of the children - means the snacks don't all disappear in one go. \"It can be really really hard when you're having to scrimp and save and spend so much time thinking and organising and figuring out where the food is going to come from,\" she says. Laura says her local pantry the Bread And Butter Thing in South Manchester has been \"a lifeline\". She pays £8.50 for three bags of surplus food from supermarkets, farms and wholesalers. What's inside is pot-luck but there is always fresh fruit and veg. \"It means I can put something on the table that they are going to want to eat and that's financially viable,\" she said. The UK's biggest food distribution network Fareshare says it has already supplied ingredients for 400,000 more meals this school holiday compared to last summer. Child Poverty Action Group is among charities warning the current funding is not enough to help all the households that are struggling.\n\nOrder your fridge by use by date\n\nColette Todd says she and children Henry and Mary don't waste any food - even crusts\n\nColette is mum to seven-year old Mary and 14-year-old Henry as has previously spoken to us about high prices in supermarkets. She lives in south Manchester and juggles three part-time jobs as a music teacher and carer. She gets paid for her school-based work at the start of each term and says making the money last over the summer holidays is always difficult. \"We have to be clever and careful about how we use the food,\" she says. \"Which is no different to normal it's just there's more meals to make out of what we've got\". There's one basic rule she sticks by: \"We don't waste anything,\" she says. \"Even crusts.\" \"It sounds really silly but it's having a system in the fridge of making sure the stuff that's at the front is the stuff that needs using first,\" she says. \"The kids are not going to rummage around and look at use by dates, but if it's at the front I know that's the one that needs using first.\" The family try and batch cook too. Henry joined in to make a bolognaise this week, and now there's an extra portion in the freezer for another day.\n\nHow to get help with school summer holiday food",
