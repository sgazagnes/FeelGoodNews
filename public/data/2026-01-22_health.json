      "title": "Stanford scientists found a way to regrow cartilage and stop arthritis",
      "summary": "Scientists at Stanford Medicine have discovered a treatment that can reverse cartilage loss in aging joints and even prevent arthritis after knee injuries. By blocking a protein linked to aging, the therapy restored healthy, shock-absorbing cartilage in old mice and injured joints, dramatically improving movement and joint function. Human cartilage samples from knee replacement surgeries also began regenerating when exposed to the treatment.",
      "content": "A study led by Stanford Medicine researchers has found that an injection blocking a protein linked to aging can reverse the natural loss of knee cartilage in older mice. The same treatment also stopped arthritis from developing after knee injuries that resemble ACL tears, which are common among athletes and recreational exercisers. Researchers note that an oral version of the treatment is already being tested in clinical trials aimed at treating age-related muscle weakness.\n\nHuman cartilage samples taken from knee replacement surgeries also responded positively. These samples included both the supportive extracellular matrix of the joint and cartilage-producing chondrocyte cells. When treated, the tissue began forming new, functional cartilage.\n\nTogether, the findings suggest that cartilage lost due to aging or arthritis may one day be restored using either a pill or a targeted injection. If successful in people, such treatments could reduce or even eliminate the need for knee and hip replacement surgery.\n\nA Direct Attack on Osteoarthritis\n\nOsteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects about one in five adults in the United States and generates an estimated $65 billion each year in direct health care costs. Current treatments focus on managing pain or replacing damaged joints surgically. There are no approved drugs that can slow or reverse the underlying cartilage damage.\n\nThe new approach targets the root cause of the disease rather than its symptoms, offering a potential shift in how osteoarthritis is treated.\n\nThe Role of a Master Aging Enzyme\n\nThe protein at the center of the study is called 15-PGDH. Researchers refer to it as a gerozyme because its levels increase as the body ages. Gerozymes were identified by the same research team in 2023 and are known to drive the gradual loss of tissue function.\n\nIn mice, higher levels of 15-PGDH are linked to declining muscle strength with age. Blocking the enzyme using a small molecule boosted muscle mass and endurance in older animals. In contrast, forcing young mice to produce more 15-PGDH caused their muscles to shrink and weaken. The protein has also been connected to regeneration in bone, nerve, and blood cells.\n\nIn most of these tissues, repair happens through the activation and specialization of stem cells. Cartilage appears to be different. In this case, chondrocytes change how their genes behave, shifting into a more youthful state without relying on stem cells.\n\nA New Path to Tissue Regeneration\n\n\"This is a new way of regenerating adult tissue, and it has significant clinical promise for treating arthritis due to aging or injury,\" said Helen Blau, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology. \"We were looking for stem cells, but they are clearly not involved. It's very exciting.\"\n\nBlau, who leads the Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology and holds the Donald E. and Delia B. Baxter Foundation Professorship, and Nidhi Bhutani, PhD, associate professor of orthopaedic surgery, are the study's senior authors. The research was published in Science. Mamta Singla, PhD, instructor of orthopaedic surgery, and former postdoctoral scholar Yu Xin (Will) Wang, PhD, served as lead authors. Wang is now an assistant professor at the Sanford Burnham Institute in San Diego.\n\nDramatic Regeneration of Joint Cartilage\n\n\"Millions of people suffer from joint pain and swelling as they age,\" Bhutani said. \"It is a huge unmet medical need. Until now, there has been no drug that directly treats the cause of cartilage loss. But this gerozyme inhibitor causes a dramatic regeneration of cartilage beyond that reported in response to any other drug or intervention.\"\n\nThe human body contains three main types of cartilage. Elastic cartilage is soft and flexible and forms structures such as the outer ear. Fibrocartilage is dense and tough, helping absorb shock in places like the spaces between spinal vertebrae. Hyaline cartilage is smooth and glossy, allowing joints such as the hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles to move with low friction. This type, also called articular cartilage, is the form most commonly damaged in osteoarthritis.\n\nWhy Cartilage Rarely Grows Back\n\nOsteoarthritis develops when joints are stressed by aging, injury, or obesity. Chondrocytes begin releasing inflammatory molecules and breaking down collagen, the main structural protein in cartilage. As collagen is lost, cartilage becomes thinner and softer. Inflammation then leads to swelling and pain, which are hallmarks of the disease.\n\nUnder normal conditions, articular cartilage has very limited ability to regenerate. While some stem or progenitor cells capable of forming cartilage have been identified in bone, similar cells have not been successfully found within articular cartilage itself.\n\nConnecting Aging, Prostaglandins, and Repair\n\nEarlier research from Blau's lab showed that prostaglandin E2 is essential for muscle stem cell function. The enzyme 15-PGDH breaks down prostaglandin E2. By blocking 15-PGDH or increasing prostaglandin E2 levels, researchers previously supported the repair of damaged muscle, nerve, bone, colon, liver, and blood cells in young mice.\n\nThis led the team to question whether the same pathway might be involved in cartilage aging and joint damage. When they compared knee cartilage from young and old mice, they found that 15-PGDH levels roughly doubled with age.\n\nRegrowing Cartilage in Aging Knees\n\nResearchers then injected older mice with a small molecule that inhibits 15-PGDH. They first administered the drug into the abdomen to affect the entire body, and later injected it directly into the knee joint. In both cases, cartilage that had become thin and dysfunctional with age thickened across the joint surface.\n\nAdditional tests confirmed that the regenerated tissue was hyaline cartilage rather than the less functional fibrocartilage.\n\n\"Cartilage regeneration to such an extent in aged mice took us by surprise,\" Bhutani said. \"The effect was remarkable.\"\n\nProtecting Joints After ACL-Like Injuries\n\nThe team observed similar benefits in mice with knee injuries resembling ACL tears, which often occur during sports involving sudden stopping, pivoting, or jumping. Although such injuries can be surgically repaired, about half of affected people develop osteoarthritis in the injured joint within 15 years.\n\nMice that received twice-weekly injections of the gerozyme inhibitor for four weeks after injury were far less likely to develop osteoarthritis. In contrast, animals given a control treatment had double the levels of 15-PGDH compared with uninjured mice and developed osteoarthritis within four weeks.\n\nTreated mice also moved more normally and placed more weight on the injured leg than untreated animals.\n\n\"Interestingly, prostaglandin E2 has been implicated in inflammation and pain,\" Blau said. \"But this research shows that, at normal biological levels, small increases in prostaglandin E2 can promote regeneration.\"\n\nReprogramming Cartilage Cells Without Stem Cells\n\nCloser analysis showed that chondrocytes in older mice expressed more genes linked to inflammation and the conversion of cartilage into bone, along with fewer genes involved in cartilage formation. Treatment shifted these patterns.\n\nOne group of chondrocytes that produced 15-PGDH and cartilage-degrading genes dropped from 8% to 3%. Another group associated with fibrocartilage formation declined from 16% to 8%. A third population, which did not produce 15-PGDH and instead expressed genes tied to hyaline cartilage formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix, rose from 22% to 42%.\n\nThese changes indicate a broad return to a more youthful cartilage profile without involving stem or progenitor cells.\n\nEvidence From Human Cartilage Samples\n\nThe researchers also tested cartilage taken from patients undergoing total knee replacement for osteoarthritis. After one week of treatment with the 15-PGDH inhibitor, the tissue showed fewer 15-PGDH-producing chondrocytes, reduced expression of cartilage degradation and fibrocartilage genes, and early signs of articular cartilage regeneration.\n\n\"The mechanism is quite striking and really shifted our perspective about how tissue regeneration can occur,\" Bhutani said. \"It's clear that a large pool of already existing cells in cartilage are changing their gene expression patterns. And by targeting these cells for regeneration, we may have an opportunity to have a bigger overall impact clinically.\"\n\nLooking Toward Human Trials\n\nBlau added, \"Phase 1 clinical trials of a 15-PGDH inhibitor for muscle weakness have shown that it is safe and active in healthy volunteers. Our hope is that a similar trial will be launched soon to test its effect in cartilage regeneration. We are very excited about this potential breakthrough. Imagine regrowing existing cartilage and avoiding joint replacement.\"\n\nResearchers from the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute also contributed to the study.\n\nThe work was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health (grants R01AR070864, R01AR077530, R01AG069858 and R00NS120278), the Baxter Foundation for Stem Cell Biology, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, the Milky Way Research Foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a Stanford Translational Research and Applied Medicine Pilot grant, a GlaxoSmithKline Sir James Black Postdoctoral Fellowship, and a Stanford Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship.\n\nBlau, Bhutani, and other co-authors are inventors on patent applications held by Stanford University related to 15-PGDH inhibition in cartilage and tissue rejuvenation, which are licensed to Epirium Bio.

In this method, researchers engineer bacteriophages synthetically using sequence data rather than bacteriophage isolates.",
      "content": "Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, have been used as medical treatments for bacterial infections for more than 100 years. Interest in these viruses is rising again as antibiotic resistance becomes a growing global health threat. Despite this renewed attention, most phage-based research has remained focused on naturally occurring viruses, largely because traditional methods for modifying phages are slow, complex, and difficult to scale.\n\nIn a new PNAS study, scientists from New England Biolabs (NEB®) and Yale University report the first fully synthetic system for engineering bacteriophages that target Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a highly antibiotic-resistant bacterium that poses a serious worldwide risk. The approach relies on NEB's High-Complexity Golden Gate Assembly (HC-GGA) platform, which allows researchers to design and build phages using digital DNA sequence data instead of relying on existing virus samples.\n\nUsing this system, the team constructed a P. aeruginosa phage from 28 synthetic DNA fragments. They then programmed the virus with new capabilities by introducing point mutations as well as DNA insertions and deletions. These changes allowed the researchers to swap tail fiber genes to change which bacteria the phage could infect and to add fluorescent markers that made infections visible in real time.\n\n\"Even in the best of cases, bacteriophage engineering has been extremely labor-intensive. Researchers spent entire careers developing processes to engineer specific model bacteriophages in host bacteria,\" reflects Andy Sikkema, the paper's co-first author and Research Scientist at NEB. \"This synthetic method offers technological leaps in simplicity, safety and speed, paving the way for biological discoveries and therapeutic development.\"\n\nBuilding Phages From Digital DNA\n\nWith NEB's Golden Gate Assembly platform, scientists can assemble an entire phage genome outside the cell using synthetic DNA, incorporating all planned genetic changes during construction. Once assembled, the genome is introduced into a safe laboratory strain where it becomes an active bacteriophage.\n\nThis strategy avoids many long-standing obstacles in phage research. Traditional approaches depend on maintaining physical phage samples and using specialized host bacteria, which can be especially challenging when working with viruses that infect dangerous human pathogens. The new method also eliminates the need for repeated rounds of screening or step-by-step genetic edits inside living cells.\n\nWhy Golden Gate Assembly Makes a Difference\n\nUnlike other DNA assembly techniques that combine fewer but longer fragments, Golden Gate Assembly uses shorter DNA segments. These shorter pieces are easier to produce, less toxic to host cells, and less likely to contain errors. The method also works well with phage genomes that contain repeated sequences or extreme GC content, both of which often complicate DNA assembly.\n\nBy simplifying the process and expanding what is technically possible, this approach significantly broadens the potential for developing bacteriophages as targeted therapies against antibiotic-resistant infections.\n\nCollaboration Turns Tools Into Therapies\n\nThe development of this rapid synthetic phage engineering system grew out of close collaboration between NEB scientists and bacteriophage researchers at Yale University. NEB researchers had spent years refining Golden Gate Assembly so it could reliably handle large DNA targets made from many fragments. Yale researchers recognized that these tools could unlock new possibilities in phage biology and reached out to explore more ambitious applications.\n\nNEB scientists first optimized the method using a well-studied model virus, Escherichia coli phage T7. From there, collaborative teams expanded the technique to non-model phages that target some of the most antibiotic-resistant bacteria known.\n\nA related study using the same Golden Gate approach to build high-GC content Mycobacterium phages was published in PNAS in November 2025 in collaboration with the Hatfull Lab at the University of Pittsburgh and Ansa Biotechnologies. In another example, researchers from Cornell University partnered with NEB to create synthetically engineered T7 phages that function as biosensors to detect E. coli in drinking water, described in a December 2025 ACS study.\n\n\"My lab builds 'weird hammers' and then looks for the right nails,\" said Greg Lohman, Senior Principal Investigator at NEB and co-author on the study. \"In this case, the phage therapy community told us, 'That's exactly the hammer we've been waiting for.'\"",

      "summary": "Researchers report that vagus nerve stimulation helped many people with long-standing, treatment-resistant depression feel better—and stay better—for at least two years. Most participants had lived with depression for decades and had exhausted nearly every other option. Those who improved at one year were very likely to maintain or increase their gains over time. Even some patients who didn’t respond initially improved after longer treatment.",
      "content": "About one in five adults in the United States will experience major depression at some point in their lives. Many people improve after trying a few treatments, but for as many as one-third of patients, standard antidepressants or psychotherapy do not provide enough relief. This condition, known as treatment-resistant depression, can persist for years or even decades. New research now suggests that a small implanted device may offer meaningful and long-lasting improvement for people with the most severe forms of the illness.\n\nScientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis led a large, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate this approach. The researchers found that a device designed to stimulate the vagus nerve was linked to sustained improvements in depressive symptoms, daily functioning, and overall quality of life. For most patients who showed improvement after one year, those gains continued for at least two years.\n\nThe participants in the study had lived with depression for an average of 29 years and had already tried about 13 treatments without success. These included intensive options such as electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation, highlighting just how difficult their condition had been to treat.\n\nThe latest results come from the ongoing RECOVER trial and were published Jan. 13 in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\n\"We believe the sample in this trial represents the sickest treatment-resistant depressed patient sample ever studied in a clinical trial,\" said lead author Charles Conway, MD, a professor of psychiatry and director of the WashU Medicine Treatment Resistant Mood Disorders Center. \"There is a dire need to find effective treatments for these patients, who often have no other options. With this kind of chronic, disabling illness, even a partial response to treatment is life-altering, and with vagus nerve stimulation we're seeing that benefit is lasting.\"\n\nHow vagus nerve stimulation works\n\nThe RECOVER study was designed to test whether adding vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to ongoing care could improve outcomes for people with treatment-resistant depression. The therapy involves surgically placing a device under the skin in the chest. The device sends carefully controlled electrical signals to the left vagus nerve -- a key communication pathway between the brain and many internal organs.\n\nThe VNS Therapy System is made by LivaNova USA, Inc., which sponsored and funded the RECOVER trial. The study is collecting long-term data on mood, daily function, and quality of life in people with severe treatment-resistant depression. One aim of the research is to help the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) decide whether to expand coverage for the therapy. Because many private insurers follow CMS decisions, approval could make the treatment accessible to far more patients, as cost has been a major barrier.\n\nInside the RECOVER trial\n\nNearly 500 patients were enrolled across 84 locations in the United States. About three-quarters of participants were so severely affected by depression that they were unable to work. All patients received the implanted device, but only half had the device activated during the first year to allow for comparison. Researchers tracked changes in depression severity, quality of life, and everyday functioning.\n\nA response was considered meaningful if symptoms improved by at least 30% compared with the start of the study. A reduction of 50% or more was classified as a \"substantial\" response.\n\nConway emphasized that even modest improvements can dramatically change a person's life. Severe depression can leave people feeling \"paralyzed by life,\" unable to manage basic daily activities and at higher risk of hospitalization or early death.\n\nEarlier findings from the blinded first year of the trial showed that patients with activated devices spent more time with improved mood, better functioning, and higher quality of life than those whose devices were not active. However, the primary measurement tool (the Montgomery-Åsberg depression scale, which measures the severity of depressive episodes) did not show a statistically significant difference between the two groups.\n\nBenefits that last over time\n\nIn the newest analysis, the researchers focused on patients whose devices were active from the start of the trial. They wanted to see whether improvements seen at 12 months would continue through 24 months. They also examined whether some patients who did not improve in the first year might respond later with continued treatment.\n\nOut of 214 patients who received active treatment from the beginning, about 69%, or 147 people, showed a meaningful response at one year in at least one outcome measure. Among those who benefited at 12 months, more than 80% maintained or improved their results by the two-year mark across measures of depression, quality of life, and daily functioning. For patients with a substantial response at one year -- defined as at least a 50% reduction in symptoms -- 92% were still benefiting at two years.\n\nNearly one-third of participants who had not improved after the first year reported benefits by the end of the second year, suggesting that the therapy may take longer to work for some individuals. Relapse rates remained low among those who responded, particularly among the strongest responders.\n\nThe researchers also found that more than 20% of treated patients, or 39 people, were in remission after 24 months. This means their symptoms had eased enough for them to function normally in daily life, a result Conway described as especially notable.\n\n\"We were shocked that one in five patients was effectively without depressive symptoms at the end of two years,\" he said. \"Seeing results like that for this complicated illness makes me optimistic about the future of this treatment. These results are highly atypical, as most studies of markedly treatment-resistant depression have very poor sustainability of benefit, certainly not at two years.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many people with depression find relief through medicine or therapy, but about one-third have a type called treatment-resistant depression. This means usual treatments don’t work, and they can suffer for years or decades.\n\n**What happened** – A large study led by Washington University tested a small implant called a vagus nerve stimulator. It sends gentle electrical signals to a nerve connecting the brain and body. Nearly 500 patients who had tried many treatments without success received the implant. Results showed that about 7 out of 10 patients improved after one year, and most of them continued to feel better or even improved more after two years.\n\n**Impact** – This implant helped people who had suffered for an average of 29 years and tried about 13 different treatments before. Some patients who didn’t get better at first started to improve later on. About 20% of patients were in remission after two years, meaning their symptoms eased enough to live normal daily lives. This is unusual because treatment-resistant depression is usually very hard to treat.\n\n**What’s next step** – The study results will help decide if health insurance should cover this implant, making it available to more people. Researchers will keep collecting data to understand how long the benefits last and who can gain the most from this treatment.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A nerve-stimulating implant has shown long-lasting benefits for people with severe depression who didn’t improve with other treatments, offering new hope for lasting relief.\n",

      "content": "Women using frozen embryos as part of their IVF treatment can either choose to use a medicated cycle or their natural one to prepare their uterus for a pregnancy. Now, scientists have found that the latter option seems to carry fewer risks\n\nDifferent options exist within IVF treatment, and we’re learning more about their effectiveness ZEPHYR/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n\nNatural ovulation is just as effective as hormone treatment for preparing the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer following in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and carries fewer risks, according to a large, randomised trial.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that for women who respond well to IVF (by being able to produce lots of eggs), freezing embryos and transferring them in a later cycle may improve success rates. As a result, frozen embryo transfers now account for the majority of embryo transfers globally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing IVF, a frozen embryo must be transferred to the uterus at a precise point in the menstrual cycle, when the endometrium – the blood vessel-rich inner lining of the uterus – is thick enough to support implantation.\n\nWomen can either choose to use a medicated cycle, where oestrogen and progesterone are taken throughout the month to prepare the uterus, or their natural cycle, if it is regular, which relies on monitoring hormones produced by the body.\n\nWhich choice is best has remained somewhat of a mystery, since no previous trial has been large enough to assess complications associated with the different methods.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nTo address this, Daimin Wei at Shandong University in Jinan, China, and colleagues conducted a large trial involving 4376 women across 24 fertility centres. All the participants were aged 20 to 40 and were planning to undergo a single frozen embryo transfer. Half were assigned a medicated protocol, the other half used their natural cycle.\n\n“This is the randomised-controlled trial we have been waiting for,” says William Buckett at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\nLive birth rates were similar across both groups at 41.6 per cent for the natural cycle and 40.6 per cent in the medicated group, suggesting that natural ovulation is just as effective as hormone treatment for preparing the uterus for implantation.\n\nClear differences emerged, however, when maternal complications during and after pregnancy were examined.\n\nWomen using their natural cycle had a lower risk of pre-eclampsia, a potentially life-threatening condition characterised by high blood pressure, and experienced fewer early pregnancy losses. They were also less likely to develop placental accreta spectrum, a condition where the placenta fails to detach easily after birth. Rates of Caesarean sections and severe bleeding after birth were also lower in this group.\n\n“These risks not only affect maternal and fetal health during pregnancy, but are also associated with long-term health postpartum,” says Wei.\n\n“This is an important new study,” says Tim Child, chair of the UK’s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority’s Scientific and Clinical Advances Advisory Committee. Clinics currently advise people with regular cycles that natural and medicated approaches have the same success rate, he says.\n\nBut Child adds that there has been some suggestion that natural cycles result in lower rates of pre-eclampsia. This might be because of the presence of a corpus luteum – a temporary structure in the ovary that forms after ovulation and produces hormones that help prepare the uterus for a pregnancy, which could influence pre-eclampsia risk.\n\n“This very large study confirms and extends previous findings and suspicions, in particular the significantly lower rate of pre-eclampsia, early pregnancy loss, placental accreta, C-section and post-partum haemorrhage [with the natural cycle route],” says Child.\n\nWei’s team now intends to examine blood samples collected during the trial to identify potential biomarkers that might explain the differences in pregnancy complications.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with frozen embryos need to prepare their uterus so it can support pregnancy. They can do this by either using hormone medicines or by relying on their body’s natural menstrual cycle.\n\n**What happened** – A large study in China tested 4,376 women aged 20 to 40 who were having frozen embryo transfers. Half used hormone treatments, and half used their natural cycle. The study found both methods worked equally well to help embryos implant and lead to live births.\n\n**Impact** – The natural cycle showed fewer health problems for the mothers. These women had lower chances of serious pregnancy issues like pre-eclampsia (dangerous high blood pressure), early pregnancy loss, and problems with the placenta after birth. They also had fewer Caesarean sections and less heavy bleeding after delivery. This makes natural ovulation a safer choice for many women.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will study blood samples from the trial to understand why natural cycles reduce these risks.
