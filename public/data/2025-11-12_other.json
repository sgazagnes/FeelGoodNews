      "title": "AI revives lost 3,000-year-old Babylonian hymn",
      "summary": "Researchers have rediscovered a long-lost Babylonian hymn from 1000 BCE, using artificial intelligence to piece together fragments scattered across the world. The hymn glorifies ancient Babylon’s beauty, prosperity, and inclusivity, even describing women’s priestly roles — a rarity in surviving texts. Once a school favorite, it now provides a rare glimpse into everyday life and beliefs of the city that once ruled the world.",
      "content": "A long-lost hymn of praise dating back to around 1000 BCE has been identified through modern technology. Professor Enrique Jiménez of LMU uncovered the text and linked it to 30 additional manuscripts using artificial intelligence.\n\nWorking in partnership with the University of Baghdad, Professor Jiménez rediscovered a Babylonian text that had remained hidden for more than a millennium. \"It's a fascinating hymn that describes Babylon in all its majesty and gives insights into the lives of its inhabitants, male and female,\" he explained. Founded around 2000 BCE in Mesopotamia, Babylon grew into the largest city of its time and became a thriving center of culture and scholarship. Many of its writings remain cornerstones of the world's literary heritage.\n\nPreserving Babylon's Written Legacy\n\nBabylonian works were inscribed in cuneiform on clay tablets, many of which have survived only in fragments. One of the key goals of the LMU-Baghdad collaboration is to decipher hundreds of cuneiform tablets from the renowned Sippar Library and ensure their preservation. According to legend, Noah concealed these tablets there before the flood.\n\nThrough the Electronic Babylonian Library Platform, Jiménez and his team are digitally archiving all known cuneiform fragments from around the world. Artificial intelligence helps match pieces that belong together, revealing connections long missed by scholars. \"Using our AI-supported platform, we managed to identify 30 other manuscripts that belong to the rediscovered hymn -- a process that would formerly have taken decades,\" said Jiménez, who teaches at LMU's Institute of Assyriology. The additional fragments made it possible to fully reconstruct the hymn, including sections that were previously incomplete.\n\nInsights Into Babylonian Society and Daily Life\n\nThe discovery of so many copies suggests that the hymn was widely known in its time. \"The hymn was copied by children at school. It's unusual that such a popular text in its day was unknown to us before now,\" noted Jiménez. The poem, dating from the early first millennium BCE, contains around 250 lines.\n\n\"It was written by a Babylonian who wanted to praise his city. The author describes the buildings in the city, but also how the waters of the Euphrates bring the spring and green the fields. This is all the more spectacular as surviving Mesopotamian literature is sparing in its descriptions of natural phenomena,\" said Jiménez. The text also sheds light on women's roles in Babylon, including priestly duties that were previously undocumented. Moreover, the hymn portrays a society that valued respect and hospitality toward foreigners -- an aspect rarely detailed in ancient literature.\n\nA Legacy Preserved in Stone and Song\n\nToday, the ruins of Babylon lie about 85 kilometers south of Baghdad, Iraq. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city's remnants continue to tell stories of a civilization whose voice, after 3,000 years, can once again be heard.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nAt CART High near Fresno, there are no bells, no fights, and no hallways echoing with chaos. Instead, students carry laptops through bright, spacious corridors on their way to classes in biotechnology, forensics, and digital marketing. It looks and feels nothing like a traditional public high school, and that’s precisely the point.\n\nCART, short for Center for Advanced Research and Technology, could represent the future of education in California. As Linda Darling-Hammond, president of the State Board of Education, put it: “The big, old-fashioned factory model of high school—where students run from class to class with a locker as their only stable point of contact—is not succeeding. We need to overhaul the whole idea of what high school can be.”\n\nNow, a new statewide pilot program from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence aims to do just that. Backed by $10 million in state funding, the initiative invites districts to redesign high school and middle school learning, focusing on flexibility, real-world experience, and stronger connections between students, teachers, and communities.\n\nA century-old system ready for change\n\nPublic high schools, as we know them, are barely a century old. Born from early 20th-century industrial ideals, they were designed around efficiency. As many of us know, this resulted in standardized classes, 50-minute periods, and a rigid unit system known as the Carnegie unit. But modern research in adolescent development shows teenagers learn best through autonomy, hands-on projects, and collaboration.\n\n“It should be a joy to go to school every day,” Darling-Hammond said. And at CART, it seems to be. Students don’t memorize facts for tests; they immerse themselves in topics that matter to them. Instead of racing through fragmented classes, they spend three hours per day in interdisciplinary “labs” where English, science, and art intersect.\n\nThis shift is already producing results. Attendance hovers near 100 percent, discipline issues are rare, and over 90 percent of students score proficient in English. Principal Rick Watson says educators from around the world visit to study CART’s model. “Comprehensive high schools don’t work for some B, C, D students,” he explained. “The students have potential, but they’re disconnected. They’re desperate for a different model of education.”\n\nTeaching that sparks curiosity\n\nAt CART, the focus is on engagement and deep, not rote, learning. English teacher Emily Saeteurn explains: “We work really hard to get kids to see the bigger picture of why they’re learning what they’re learning. We want them to have that ‘aha!’ moment.”\n\nBiotechnology students read The Andromeda Strain and The Martian before writing their own science fiction stories based on real genetic concepts. In law and policy, teens read Othello and Hamlet before staging mock trials of Shakespearean characters. The approach makes academics tangible and relevant.\n\nSenior Madelyn Quiroga says she struggled at her traditional high school but thrives at CART. “At my other school, they just throw stuff at you and never really explain it. Here, they actually teach us, and it’s all stuff we actually want to know,” she said. “Like when I hear someone talk about CRISPR, it’s like, ‘Oh, I know something about that.’”\n\nHer classmate Audrey Riede, studying law, says she now hopes to become a defense attorney. “CART is way better than normal school,” she said. “The teachers aren’t just trying to get you to pass; they really want to make you think.”\n\nChallenges ahead for reform\n\nThe state faces major hurdles in expanding CART’s success. Colleges still rely on the A-G course requirements and traditional letter grades for admissions, leaving little flexibility for innovative coursework. The Carnegie unit, which ties credits to time spent in class rather than mastery, remains deeply embedded in both high school and university systems.\n\nEven the Carnegie Foundation has urged reforms, advocating for progress-based measures over time-based ones. But as of now, most higher education institutions remain reluctant to change.\n\nStill, advocates like Russlynn Ali, head of the XQ Institute and former U.S. Department of Education official, believe the momentum is shifting. “There are young people today who’ve graduated from high school but can’t calculate the tip on a split bill or grasp the main idea in an op-ed piece,” she said. “The case for change is unmistakable.”\n\nA model of possibility\n\nCART’s success story began 25 years ago as a partnership between Clovis Unified and Fresno Unified, designed to help struggling students connect learning to real careers. Today, it serves 1,000 juniors and seniors each year, nearly 80 percent from low-income families. The school’s popularity continues to grow. Last year, more than twice as many students applied as there were spots available.\n\nAs California prepares to announce the winning redesign proposals, CART’s bright yellow halls stand as a living example of what education could be: a place where learning feels relevant, curiosity thrives, and every student, from the A student to the “C kid”, finds a reason to show up.",
