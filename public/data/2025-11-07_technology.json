      "title": "Will quantum be bigger than AI?",
      "summary": "The highly complex technology is increasingly being tipped to transform computing.",
      "content": "Will quantum be bigger than AI?\n\n1 day ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman Technology editor Share Save\n\nBBC Tech firms such as Microsoft, whose Majorana chip is pictured here, are racing to embrace quantum\n\nThere's an old adage among tech journalists like me - you can either explain quantum accurately, or in a way that people understand, but you can't do both. That's because quantum mechanics - a strange and partly theoretical branch of physics - is a fiendishly difficult concept to get your head around. It involves tiny particles behaving in weird ways. And this odd activity has opened up the potential of a whole new world of scientific super power. Its mind-boggling complexity is probably a factor in why quantum has ended up with a lower profile than tech's current rockstar - artificial intelligence (AI). This is despite a steady stream of recent big quantum announcements from tech giants like Microsoft and Google among others.\n\nBroadly speaking, we tend to think about quantum more commonly in the form of hardware like sensors and computers, while AI is more software-based – it requires hardware to operate. Put them together, and we might one day have a new form of technology that's more powerful than anything we have ever created… although the word \"might\" is doing some heavy lifting in that particular prediction, warns Brian Hopkins, VP and principal analyst in emerging tech at research firm Forresters. \"The potential is there, but the jury is still out,\" he says. \"Initial experiments suggest promise, but they all indicate that we require much more powerful quantum computers and further innovative research to effectively apply quantum effects to AI.\" In terms of their value, both are lucrative. The quantum sector could be worth up to $97bn (£74bn) by 2035, according to market research group McKinsey. Meanwhile, AI's value is forecast in the trillions. But they both live under the shadow of hype and the bursting of bubbles. \"I used to believe that quantum computing was the most-hyped technology until the AI craze emerged,\" jokes Mr Hopkins. In mid-October analysts warned some key quantum stocks could fall by up to 62%, while mutterings about an AI bubble grow ever louder.\n\nQuantum and AI have one more thing in common - errors. While we are largely familiar now with the \"hallucinations\" of generative AI tools, quantum is plagued by a different kind of error. These are caused because the state in which the particles have to operate is so fragile. The slightest change to the environment, including light and noise, can disrupt them. It's tricky to sustain such an environment. This week Elon Musk suggested on X that quantum computing would run best on the \"permanently shadowed craters of the moon\". Quantum computers don't look anything like a traditional machines. There is no design blueprint, but they are currently very big. They exist in laboratories, and the most commonly adopted format seems to include a kind of jellyfish-inspired shape. They require extremely cold temperatures and lasers. It's not the sort of thing you're likely to have in your home, let alone in your pocket. They're also a bit bling - researchers have found that using synthetic diamonds to create qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers, enables them to work much closer to room temperature. The luxury jeweller De Beers has a subsidiary company called Element Six, which claims to have launched the world's first general-purpose quantum-grade diamond in 2020. And it has worked with Amazon Web Services on optimising artificial diamonds for future networks of quantum machines.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Quantum computers, such as this on display, are large structures\n\nThese machines are all in their infancy right now, there are believed to be around 200 of them in the whole world (China however has not disclosed how many it has) – this doesn't stop quantum experts making bold claims about their potential. \"We as consumers will touch the impacts of quantum computing in almost every walk of our lives,\" said Rajeeb Hazra, the boss of Quantinuum, a firm recently valued at $10bn. He was talking to the BBC's Tech Life podcast. \"The area of quantum computing is, in my mind, when you look at the applications, as big if not bigger than AI.\" Prof Sir Peter Knight is one of the UK's top quantum experts. \"Things that could take the age of the universe to calculate, even on the most powerful supercomputer, could be performed probably in seconds,\" he told Dr Jim Al-Khaleli on BBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific. So what exactly are these gigantic, life-changing things that the machines might do once they're ready? As with AI, there's a lot of quantum research directed towards improving healthcare. Quantum computers could one day be able to effortlessly churn through endless combinations of molecules to come up with new drugs and medications – a process that currently takes years and years using classical computers. To give you an idea of that scale - in December 2024, Google unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow, which it claimed could take five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world's fastest super computers 10 septillion years - or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years – to complete. Hazra says this could pave the way for personalised medication, where instead of getting a standard prescription, you get a specific drug tailormade for your individual body, that's most likely to work for you.\n\nAnd that applies to wider chemical processes too, such as new ways to produce fertilizers more efficiently, potentially a huge boost for global farmers. Quantum sensors, which use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure things incredibly precisely, already exist and are found in atomic clocks. In 2019, scientists at Nottingham University put them in a prototype device the size of a bike helmet, and used them in a new system to conduct non-intrusive brain scans on children with conditions such as epilepsy. \"The foundations for human cognition are laid down in the first decades of life, but there have always been limited ways to study them due to restrictions in brain scanning technology,\" said researcher Ryan Hill at the time. \"A particular problem has always been movement and the fact that the large traditional fixed scanners have always required patients to stay completely still. \"Not only does this fail to give an accurate picture of the brain operating in a natural environment, but it also places severe restrictions on who can be scanned, with children representing the biggest challenge.\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images Quantum is tipped to greatly speed up drug development\n\nLast year, scientists at Imperial College, London trialled an alternative to GPS satellite navigation, dubbed a \"quantum compass\", on the city's underground Tube network. GPS doesn't work underground but this does – the idea is that it could more accurately track and pinpoint objects anywhere in the world, either above or below ground, unlike GPS signals which can be blocked, jammed and affected by the weather. \"The UK economy relies on GPS to the tune of £1bn per day, position, navigation and timing – this is often labelled a defence requirement - but all our financial transactions require a timestamp for authentication,\" says Dr Michael Cuthbert, director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre. \"Using quantum clocks, gyroscopes and magnetometers enables us to create a resilience against jamming and spoofing of our vital navigational systems.\" The National Grid is investing in quantum research to see if it can help with what's known as \"load shedding\" - how to maximise the output of thousands of generators from various energy sources as demand rises and falls in real time, preventing blackouts. And Airbus partnered with the UK quantum firm IonQ to trial quantum-based algorithms designed to load cargo more efficiently onto aircraft. An aircraft can use thousands of kilos of extra fuel if its centre of gravity shifts by just a small amount.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Western analysts are unsure how many quantum computers China has developed",

      "content": "The amplification of extremely short laser pulses (under 100 fs) presents a fundamental challenge due to the trade-off between amplification bandwidth, efficiency and gain1. Conventional methods rely on complex optical set-ups with preprocessing and postprocessing steps2. Optical parametric amplification3 offers a high optical gain that scales with the length of the nonlinear medium at the expense of bandwidth, limiting its effectiveness for extremely short and intrinsically broadband ultrashort pulses, whose amplification requires a broad gain–bandwidth, high single-pass gain and simultaneously strong nonlinear interaction. Here we introduce a new multipass4 optical parametric amplification system that leverages dispersion-engineered dielectric mirrors to repeatedly focus the laser into a nonlinear gain crystal. The coatings simultaneously compensate for the group delay5 after each multipass step and suppress the idler wave and, therefore, backconversion. This approach achieves ×1,500 higher gain compared with single-pass amplification, a photon conversion efficiency of up to 81% (52% system conversion efficiency) and near Fourier-limited time–bandwidth products of the amplified pulses, while fully preserving the spatial beam quality. Our concept breaks the gain versus bandwidth barrier and achieves 12 THz at 41 dB gain. As our concept does not require specific gain materials, it is versatile and broadly applicable to ultrafast6 laser systems in quantum technologies7,8,9, attosecond physics10,11,12, material processing and ultrabroadband low-cost bio-imaging systems13,14.

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Amplifying extremely short laser pulses, lasting less than 100 femtoseconds (one quadrillionth of a second), is difficult because it requires a balance between how much the signal is boosted (gain), how wide the range of colors or frequencies is (bandwidth), and how efficient the process is. Traditional methods use complicated setups and often cannot amplify very short pulses well.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists have created a new kind of laser amplifier called a multipass optical parametric amplifier. It uses special mirrors designed to control how light spreads out over time (dispersion-engineered dielectric mirrors). These mirrors allow the laser beam to pass multiple times through a special crystal, increasing the amplification greatly while keeping the pulse short and clear. This design reduces losses and keeps the laser beam high quality.\n\n**Impact** – This new amplifier achieves 1,500 times more gain than older single-pass amplifiers and converts photons very efficiently—up to 81%.

      "title": "Grafting trick could let us gene-edit a huge variety of plants",
      "summary": "Many plants including cocoa, coffee and avocado cannot be gene-edited but a technique involving grafting could change that, opening the door to more productive and nutritious varieties",
      "content": "Many plants including cocoa, coffee and avocado cannot be gene-edited but a technique involving grafting could change that, opening the door to more productive and nutritious varieties\n\nCoffee plants can be propagated by grafting a shoot onto the rootstock of another plant sirichai_asawalapsakul/G​etty Images\n\nThe ancient trick of grafting one plant onto another could find a very modern use – enabling gene editing of plants that are very difficult or impossible to edit by other means.\n\n“It is still at the beginning stage, but this technique has great potential,” says Ugo Rogo at the University of Pisa in Italy.\n\nMaking plants more productive and more nutritious is vital for tackling the huge damage done by farming and for limiting food price hikes as the world’s population grows and climate change increasingly hits yields. The precise changes that can be made with CRISPR gene editing are the best way of achieving this.\n\nHowever, gene editing plants is tricky because plants have rigid cells walls around them, unlike animal cells. Conventional genetic engineering of plants involves techniques such as firing DNA-impregnated pellets at plant cells – known as biolistics – or using a natural gene-engineering microbe known as Agrobacterium.\n\nThese approaches rely on generating entire plants from modified cells, and with many plants, especially trees, this cannot be done. For instance, it does not work with cocoa, coffee, sunflowers, cassava or avocados.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nEven for plants where it does work, there is another major issue. When gene editing is used to induce tiny mutations of the kind that are very common naturally, regulators in several countries see it as equivalent to standard plant breeding, meaning such plants can get approval without the long and expensive trials required for conventional genetically-modified plants. But with biolistics and Agrobacterium, extra DNA is often inserted into plants’ genomes, so they would have to go through the full regulatory process.\n\nPlant scientists are trying to find ways of editing plants that work for more species and that don’t add any unwanted bits of DNA to the genome. One option is to use viruses to deliver RNA coding for parts of the CRISPR toolkit to plant cells. Here, the problem is the Cas9 protein widely used for gene editing is very large, meaning the RNA coding for it can’t fit into most viruses.\n\nIn 2023, Friedrich Kragler at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Germany unveiled another approach. He knew plant roots produce a special type of RNA that can travel around plants and enter cells in the shoots and leaves.\n\nSo his team genetically engineered plants to produce such RNAs coding for two key CRISPR components: the Cas protein that does the editing and the guide RNA that tells it where to make the edit. They then grafted shoots of non-modified plants onto the roots of the modified plants, and showed this resulted in gene editing of some of the shoots and seeds.\n\nRogo and his colleagues think the approach is so promising they have now written a paper highlighting it and encouraging others to help develop it. “Grafting gives us the possibility to use the CRISPR system in trees or in plants such as sunflowers,” Rogo says.\n\nThe key thing about grafting is relatively distantly related plants can be grafted onto each other – for instance, you can graft tomato shoots onto potato rootstocks. So even though it isn’t possible to genetically engineer a sunflower rootstock for gene editing, it should be possible to engineer related plants to make a compatible rootstock.\n\nOnce there is a rootstock producing the necessary RNAs, it can be used to gene edit a wide variety of plants. “You can use the roots to deliver Cas9 and editing guides to all sorts of elite varieties,” says Julian Hibberd at the University of Cambridge.\n\n“Making the transgenic rootstock is not a big effort, given that it just needs to be made once, and then can be used forever and for multiple species,” says Ralph Bock, who is also at the Max Planck Institute but not part of Kragler’s team.\n\nAs one example, only a few grape varieties, such as Chardonnay, can regenerate from single cells and can thus be modified. But once a Chardonnay gene editing rootstock conferring, say, disease resistance has been created, it would work for all grape varieties and beyond.\n\nRogo also envisages combining grafting with the viral approach. Rootstocks could be used to deliver the large mRNAs for Cas9, while viruses provide the guide RNAs. In this way, the same rootstock could be used to make many different gene edits, he says.",

      "content": "Preparation of MR yarns\n\nWe selected LDPE as the flexible matrix because of its high filler capacity enabled by highly branched chains with low molecular packing46 and good flowability indicated by a broad molecular weight distribution (Supplementary Fig. 23) and significant shear thinning (Extended Data Fig. 1a). CIP was chosen over other soft magnetic materials for its high susceptibility and low remnant magnetization, availability in micro-spherical particles, cost-effectiveness and resistance to oxidation with SiO 2 coating (Supplementary Table 2). CIPs coated with SiO 2 (SQ, BASF SE; Supplementary Fig. 24) were dispersed within LDPE (1700 MN 18C, total energies SE; melt flow rate of 70 g/10 min at 190 °C/2.16 kg) by melt compounding by a twin-screw extruder (Thermo Fisher Hot Melt Extruder Pharma 11). The temperature profile, ranging from the hopper to the die, was set at 10, 80, 130, 150, 150, 150, 150, 150, and 150 °C, respectively, while the screw speed was kept at 50 rpm. Four LDPE/CIP composites were prepared, varying in CIP content at 30, 50, 70, and 80 wt%. Interfacial interactions between LDPE molecules and CIPs (Supplementary Note 8 and Supplementary Fig. 25) promote the wetting of polymer on CIP surfaces, ensuring the uniform CIP dispersion of composites with filler content up to 80 wt% (Extended Data Fig. 7). Among these, the composite containing 70 wt% CIPs was chosen for fibre spinning.\n\nThis selected composite was introduced into the barrel of a laboratory melt spinning machine (AT225, Anytester Hefei) to produce MR fibres. The three heating zones of the barrel were set at 140 °C, 150 °C and 160 °C, respectively, allowing the composites to melt for 10 min until reaching a stable temperature of 160 °C. Nitrogen was then filled into the barrel to provide a pressure of 1.2 MPa. The molten polymer strands were extruded through a spinneret and guided by a ceramic wheel onto a collection roller with a diameter of 8.2 cm. A cooling fan positioned between the spinneret and the guide wheel facilitated solidification of the molten composite fibres. The diameter of the resulting MR fibre could be controlled by adjusting the winding speed, and in this case, the extruded molten filaments with a diameter of 750 μm underwent rapid thinning over a short range of about 20 cm (Extended Data Fig. 3). MR fibres with a diameter of 57 μm were consistently produced at a winding speed of 130 rpm. Then, seven of these fully drawn fibres were twisted clockwise to form a yarn, which was subsequently heat-set in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h to alleviate residual stress and stabilize the twist configuration. The primary goal in optimizing the structure of MR yarn was to maximize A y /I y , which is inversely related to the diameter of the fibres and directly related to the helical angle of the yarn (Supplementary Note 1). Given that the fibre diameter directly correlates with its modulus, our evaluation focused on optimizing A y /EI y to refine the MR yarn design.\n\nFabrication of MR fabrics\n\nWoven MR fabrics were fabricated by interlacing MR yarns as weft and sewing thread as warp at right angles, using a hand weaving machine. Float lengths of 1, 2 and 4 were specifically chosen to fabricate plain-, twill-, and satin-weave MR fabrics that exhibit packing densities of 65 yarns cm−1, 83 yarns cm−1, and 111 yarns cm−1, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 8). These selections enable the examination of the spatial freedom of interlacing MR yarns concerning their float length and packing density. The plain weave has the highest number of interlacing points, followed by the twill weave, and the satin weave.\n\nCut-pile MR fabrics were fabricated by inserting MR yarns into holes of a base plain-weave fabric using a punch needle kit. On pulling the needle out, a loop of MR yarn formed on the opposite side, its length controlled by the depth of needle insertion. This process repeated until the predefined area was uniformly filled at yarn densities of 250 yarns cm−2 or 500 yarns cm−2. Subsequently, a thin layer of silicone glue was applied to secure the inserted yarns. The loops were then cut at their centre points, followed by the application of silicone precursor at the cut tips. After curing overnight at room temperature, the silicone effectively prevented the free ends from untwisting.\n\nCoefficient of friction\n\nThe as-spun filaments, each with a length of 3 cm, were arranged in parallel without any gaps to form a 1-cm wide region and adhered onto a square glass measuring 3 cm × 3 cm and weighing 1.8 g using a double-sided tape. Two identical samples were prepared for the measurement: one with the filaments facing upwards, and the glass side fixed onto a horizontal linear platform, and the other sample with the filaments facing downwards, aligned face-to-face and parallel to the filament region of the first sample. At the left edge of the top glass packed with filament tips, the centre point of the glass edge was horizontally connected to a force gauge using a nylon filament. A series of weights (1 g, 2 g, 5 g, 10 g, 20 g, 50 g and 100 g) were separately placed on top of the sample to provide normal force F nf = m tm g, where m tm is the total mass of the weight and top glass substrate, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The linear platform moved away from the force gauge at a velocity of 5 µm s−1. The maximum reading of the force gauge was recorded as the maximum static friction F friction , and the static friction coefficient a was calculated using the formula: F friction = aF nf . The static coefficient of friction between MR fibres was measured in the same way, by replacing the filaments with fibres.\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry experiments were conducted using a Mettler Toledo DSC3 in a nitrogen atmosphere. Each sample, weighing approximately 1.5 mg, was analysed within a temperature range of 55–135 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to record the endothermic curves. The heat of fusion (ΔH f ) was determined by integrating the heat flow between 60 °C and 115 °C. This parameter was then used to calculate the crystallinity degree (χ) of both pure LDPE and the composite matrix. The crystallinity degree χ was defined as the ratio of ΔH f /(1 − x), where x represents the content of CIPs in the composite, to the heat of fusion (289.9 J g−1) of the purely crystalline form of polyethylene47.\n\nMR fibre thermal shrinkage\n\nMR fibre shrinkage was assessed by subjecting the MR fibres with a length of 30–50 mm to a temperature of 100 °C for 10 min without external constraints. Shrinkage was quantified as the percentage change in the original MR fibre length using the formula, Shrinkage (%) = 100 × (L if − L sf )/L if , where L if represents the initial fibre length and L sf represents the fibre length after complete shrinkage. The thermal shrinkage results provide insights into both the elongation and arrangement of polymer chains within the MR fibres. This is attributed to the relaxation of polymer chains during the thermal shrinkage process.\n\nTensile measurement\n\nLDPE and composites containing 30 wt%, 50 wt% and 70 wt% CIPs samples with a dimension of 30 × 10 × 0.105 mm3 were stretched to break at a velocity of 0.3 mm s−1 by a universal testing machine (Model 5566, Instron).\n\nStructure characterization\n\nScanning electron microscopy images were obtained using a Tescan VEGA3 microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector. Polymer composite samples were subjected to freeze fracture in liquid nitrogen to expose the cross-sectional surfaces, and then sputter coating was done with Au. The imaging was conducted at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping was performed to analyse the distribution of Si, O and Fe on the surface of CIP. Optical photographs were captured using a Leica M165 C High-Performance Stereo Microscope to visualize the structure and extract the geometrical parameters of yarns and fabrics. Nano-computed tomography analysis was conducted using a Zeiss Xradia 520 Versa 3D X-ray microscope to examine the distribution of CIPs within the MR fibre. An MR fibre, approximately 1 mm in length, was mounted on the sample stage. Cross-sectional images, each with a resolution of 480 nm, were sequentially captured along the length at specified intervals. These images were then processed to generate a 3D reconstruction of the MR fibre. The polymer matrix was then extracted, in which the white zones represent CIPs. The directional distribution of CIPs within the MR fibre was assessed using ImageJ software with the following processing steps48. Initially, the raw nano-computed tomography images of both transverse and longitudinal sections were converted into binary images using an appropriate threshold to delineate the CIP distribution. Subsequently, the adjustable watershed algorithm was applied to segment the binary image effectively. The areas reflecting concentrated CIPs appeared as white zones within the images and were then fitted with ellipses to account for any orientation in the CIP distribution. Finally, the orientation of each CIP-concentrated area was determined by measuring the tilt angles of the ellipses relative to the horizontal plane. The degree of orientation was analysed based on the percentage distribution of different angles.\n\nMagnetization characterization\n\nMagnetic measurements were conducted at room temperature using the Physical Properties Measurement System (Quantum Design) with a sweep of external magnetic field ranging from −13 kOe to 13 kOe. Samples, including CIPs, LDPE, and composites with CIP contents of 30 wt%, 50 wt%, and 70 wt%, were tested without any preferred direction. The MR yarn was tested twice with the axis oriented parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the applied magnetic field.\n\nOscillatory shear rheology\n\nDynamic rheological characterization of both neat LDPE and composites was conducted using a rheometer (AR 2000EX, TA Instruments) equipped with parallel plate geometry. The samples were compressed into disc-shaped specimens with a thickness of 2 mm and a diameter of 25 mm for testing purposes. Frequency sweeps were performed at 160 °C, with the frequency ranging from 100 Hz to 0.01 Hz, while maintaining a strain of 0.5% within the linear viscoelastic region.\n\nDynamic mechanical analysis\n\nDynamic mechanical analysis experiments were carried out using a Mettler Toledo DMA1. Samples of LDPE and composites containing 70 wt% CIPs were analysed from −150 °C to −50 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to record tan δ curves.\n\nBending actuation characterization\n\nThe bending property of MR yarns was characterized by subjecting vertically cantilevered MR yarns, anchored at their top end, to uniform magnetic fields. MR yarns were cantilevered at the top and positioned vertically within the central space between the two poles of an electromagnet (PEM-20, Litian Magnetoelectrican Science & Technology). The desktop electromagnet measures 260 mm (length) × 180 mm (width) × 200 mm (height) with two 40 × 40 mm poles spaced at an adjustable distance of 0–60 mm (Supplementary Fig. 26a). Within the space between poles, highly uniform magnetic fields can be generated with controllable strength by varying the current and the pole distance (Supplementary Fig. 26b–e). This stationary device allows for precise and uniform magnetic field adjustments across a wide range, providing a versatile workspace for material property characterization and testing in various applications. Static magnetic fields were oriented at 87° to the yarn axis to control the direction of bending; as the magnetic field strength increased, the cantilevered MR yarns gradually bent upwards (Supplementary Fig. 27a). The bending deformation was captured using a camera, and the images were processed using ImageJ to quantify the bending degree. MR yarns with lengths of 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm were tested.\n\nTo measure the moment output of a MR yarn with length L yarn and weight m yarn , a thin paperboard strip, of weight m ps , was attached along the entire free portion of the cantilevered MR yarn (Supplementary Fig. 27b). The magnetic field strength was set to specific values (70 mT, 140 mT, 210 mT, 280 mT and 300 mT), and the cantilevered MR yarn lifted until the midpoint was blocked perpendicular by the PMMA rod connected to the force gauge. At this point, the yarn formed a 45° angle with the vertical direction. The force F block required to block the midpoint was recorded. The moment density of the MR yarn was calculated as M pm = M bending /m yarn = [(m ps /m yarn + 1)g sin 45° + F block ]L yarn /2. The output moment per unit mass of fabrics was measured in a similar way by using woven MR fabrics with float lengths of 1, 2 and 4 measuring 20 × 5 mm with MR yarns aligned along the length direction. For each float length, three independently fabricated samples were evaluated separately.\n\nStiffening characterization\n\nThe MR yarns with a length of 25 mm were measured by a three-point bending test (Supplementary Fig. 28). The lower anvil with a gap of 15 mm was fixed onto an acrylic tube, which was placed on the pan of an analytical balance (ME204, Mettler Toledo) to record the force. To prevent magnetic interference with the balance, a PMMA support with a height of 25 cm was placed beneath the three-point bending support anvil. The upper anvil was connected to an Instron, which provided a downward displacement of 3 mm and returned to the starting position at the rate of 0.1 mm s−1. Three samples of each type of yarns were tested separately. Magnetic fields were generated by a pair of N52 cylindrical magnets (diameter 70 mm and thickness 30 mm) placed parallel to the opposite poles face to face. The magnetic field strength was controlled by the distance between the two magnets. The woven MR fabrics were tested in a similar way by using a load cell (2530-10N) for recording the force.\n\nBending durability test\n\nThe bending durability of the MR yarn was evaluated using a continuous bending setup (Supplementary Fig. 29). A 30-cm sample was fixed at one end to a vertical glass surface. The yarn was threaded horizontally through two pairs of guide pulleys (diameter 13.76 mm) spaced 8 cm apart, followed by a single pulley (diameter 17.2 mm) mounted on a PMMA plate. A pre-tension of 32.7% of the breaking strength of the yarn was applied to the free end using a hook-weight assembly. A pair of guide pulleys (diameter 13.76 mm) was attached to a moving PMMA fixture on an Instron testing machine, programmed to cyclically bend the yarn 90° upwards and 90° downwards for around 5,000 cycles at 0.25 Hz.\n\nCreep test\n\nA plain-weave MR fabric (35 mm × 40 mm) with MR yarns aligned lengthwise was fixed at both ends with a 30-mm gap. A 100-g load on a PMMA block (3.25 g) applied a uniform pressure of 2.95 MPa over an area of 35 mm × 10 mm across the fabric centre. Initial deflection on loading was 0.84 mm, with no observable creep within 1,000 s. Under a magnetic field of 178 mT along the MR yarn axis, the initial deflection of the fabric decreased because of magnetic stiffening, with minimal creep observed over the same period.\n\nA cut-pile MR fabric (40 mm × 40 mm) with a 4-mm-thick MR yarn layer was uniformly pressed with a pressure of 0.71 MPa by a loading of 113.6 g on the MR yarn layer, its thickness decreased to 3.65 mm. No additional thickness reduction occurred across 1,000 s, and under a vertical magnetic field of 187 mT, the initial compression decreased with no detectable creep on this timescale.\n\nFinite-element analysis\n\nA 3D model was constructed using the Magnetomechanical node of COMSOL Multiphysics. Two rectangular magnets measuring 300 μm × 300 μm × 50 μm were built face to face to provide uniform magnetic fields. The surrounding air domain is modelled as a sphere with a radius of 2,300 μm. The two permanent magnets and air domain were from the COMSOL material library, and the mechanical and magnetic properties of the MR yarn were entered based on the experimental results.\n\nLinear actuator fabrication and test\n\nThe basic concept uses radially symmetric woven MR fabrics, each resembling a hinge, with a shared wrap yarn acting as a pivot to couple axial force to the bending moments of the woven MR fabrics. The linear fabric actuator was fabricated by integrating four plain-weave MR fabric hinges in the form of a four-sided Sarrus linkage. Each plain-weave MR fabric hinge was assembled by two plain-weave MR fabrics, measuring 5 mm × 5 mm, which shared the same wrap yarn as a pivot. To measure its stroke and force output, the linear actuator was placed on a PMMA plate within a vertical magnetic field (Supplementary Fig. 30). Initially, the actuator was fully extended, with the horizontal part of the PMMA fixture touching its top surface without force. An Instron machine then applied a downward displacement of 5 mm at 0.25 mm s−1, pressing the actuator down and recording its upward force on the PMMA fixture. After each test, the PMMA fixture returned to the starting position by the Instron machine. At the same time, the linear actuator also returned to the starting configuration due to the magnetic actuation.\n\nVentilation fabric demonstration\n\nThe linear actuator was sandwiched in the centre between an elastic fabric with slits and a breathable woven fabric, with an annulus of spacer fabric stitched at the edge to form a dis-shaped active ventilation fabric with a diameter of 90 mm and a thickness of 5 mm.\n\nThe water vapour permeability (WVP) of active ventilation fabric was measured according to BS 7209. The active ventilation fabric with elastic fabric facing upwards was firmly fixed on top of a glass vessel (diameter 70 mm) filled with about 30 g distilled water and operated under square-wave actuation at frequencies of 0 Hz, 0.2 Hz, 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz and 2 Hz with a peak magnetic field strength of 250 mT for 30 min. The WVP is calculated as WVP = M/(At), where M is the water loss in mass, t is the time duration and A is the area of the exposed fabric.",

Such materials could be used in clothing, ventilation systems, and other products that adapt to different needs.\n\n**What happened**\nResearchers have developed a way to mass-produce special fibers made from tiny magnetic particles mixed into a flexible plastic called LDPE. These fibers can be spun into yarns and woven into fabrics. When a magnetic field is applied, the fabrics can bend, stiffen, or change shape. The team carefully tested how to make these fibers, how to weave them into different types of fabrics, and how the fabrics respond to magnets. They also built a fabric-based actuator, a device that moves using these magnetic fabrics, and demonstrated an active ventilation fabric that can open and close to control airflow.\n\n**Impact**\nThis is the first time such magnetically responsive fibers have been produced on a large scale and made into woven fabrics with real actuation and stiffening abilities. Unlike earlier materials, these fabrics can be shaped into different weave patterns and still respond well to magnetic fields. This opens up new possibilities for smart textiles that can adapt their stiffness or shape in real time, which could be useful for clothing that adjusts to temperature or movement, or for ventilation systems that control airflow automatically.\n\n**What's next step**\nFuture work will likely focus on improving the durability and comfort of these fabrics for everyday use. Researchers may explore different fiber designs, weave patterns, or combinations with other materials to create wearable smart textiles. They may also develop practical products like adjustable ventilation clothing or responsive furniture coverings.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway**\nScientists have created magnetic fibers that can be woven into fabrics able to bend and stiffen when exposed to magnets, paving the way for new smart textiles and adaptive materials.\n",
