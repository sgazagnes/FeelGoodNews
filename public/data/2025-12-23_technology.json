      "content": "Researchers at Duke University have created a new artificial intelligence framework designed to uncover clear, easy-to-understand rules behind some of the most complicated dynamics seen in nature and modern technology.\n\nThe system is inspired by the work of history's great \"dynamicists\" -- scientists who study systems that change over time. Just as Isaac Newton, often considered the first dynamicist, developed equations linking force and motion, this AI analyzes data that shows how complex systems evolve and then produces equations that accurately describe that behavior.\n\nWhat sets this approach apart is its ability to handle complexity far beyond human capacity. The AI can take nonlinear systems involving hundreds or even thousands of interacting variables and reduce them to simpler rules with far fewer dimensions.\n\nA New Tool for Understanding Change Over Time\n\nThe research, published December 17 online in the journal npj Complexity, introduces a powerful new way for scientists to use AI to study systems that evolve over time -- including weather patterns, electrical circuits, mechanical devices, and biological signals.\n\n\"Scientific discovery has always depended on finding simplified representations of complicated processes,\" said Boyuan Chen, director of the General Robotics Lab and the Dickinson Family Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke. \"We increasingly have the raw data needed to understand complex systems, but not the tools to turn that information into the kinds of simplified rules scientists rely on. Bridging that gap is essential.\"\n\nA classic example of simplification comes from physics. The path of a cannon ball depends on many factors, including launch speed and angle, air resistance, changing wind conditions, and even ambient temperature. Despite this complexity, a close approximation of its motion can be captured with a simple linear equation that uses only the launch speed and angle.\n\nBuilding on a Decades-Old Mathematical Idea\n\nThis kind of simplification reflects a theoretical concept introduced by mathematician Bernard Koopman in the 1930s. Koopman showed that complex nonlinear systems can be represented mathematically using linear models. The new AI framework builds directly on this idea.\n\nThere is an important challenge, however. Representing highly complex systems with linear models often requires constructing hundreds or even thousands of equations, each tied to a different variable. Handling that level of complexity is difficult for human researchers.\n\nThat is where artificial intelligence becomes especially valuable.\n\nHow the AI Reduces Complexity\n\nThe framework studies time-series data from experiments and identifies the most meaningful patterns in how a system changes. It combines deep learning with constraints inspired by physics to narrow down the system to a much smaller set of variables that still capture its essential behavior. The outcome is a compact model that behaves mathematically like a linear system while remaining faithful to real-world complexity.\n\nTo test the approach, the researchers applied it to a wide variety of systems. These ranged from the familiar swinging motion of a pendulum to the nonlinear behavior of electrical circuits, as well as models used in climate science and neural circuits. Although these systems differ greatly, the AI consistently uncovered a small number of hidden variables that governed their behavior. In many cases, the resulting models were more than 10 times smaller than those produced by earlier machine-learning methods, while still delivering reliable long-term predictions.\n\n\"What stands out is not just the accuracy, but the interpretability,\" said Chen, who also holds appointments in electrical and computer engineering and computer science. \"When a linear model is compact, the scientific discovery process can be naturally connected to existing theories and methods that human scientists have developed over millennia. It's like connecting AI scientists with human scientists.\"\n\nFinding Stability and Warning Signs\n\nThe framework does more than make predictions. It can also identify stable states, known as attractors, where a system naturally settles over time. Recognizing these states is critical for determining whether a system is operating normally, slowly drifting, or approaching instability.\n\n\"For a dynamicist, finding these structures is like finding the landmarks of a new landscape,\" said Sam Moore, the lead author and PhD candidate in Chen's General Robotics Lab. \"Once you know where the stable points are, the rest of the system starts to make sense.\"\n\nThe researchers note that this method is especially useful when traditional equations are unavailable, incomplete, or too complex to derive. \"This is not about replacing physics,\" Moore continued. \"It's about extending our ability to reason using data when the physics is unknown, hidden, or too cumbersome to write down.\"\n\nToward Machine Scientists\n\nLooking ahead, the team is exploring how the framework could help guide experimental design by actively selecting which data to collect in order to reveal a system's structure more efficiently. They also plan to apply the method to richer forms of data, including video, audio, and signals from complex biological systems.\n\nThis research supports a long-term goal in Chen's General Robotics Lab to develop \"machine scientists\" that assist with automated scientific discovery. By linking modern AI with the mathematical language of dynamical systems, the work points toward a future in which AI does more than recognize patterns. It may help uncover the fundamental rules that shape both the physical world and living systems.\n\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the Army Research Laboratory STRONG program (W911NF2320182, W911NF2220113), the Army Research Office (W911NF2410405), the DARPA FoundSci program (HR00112490372), and the DARPA TIAMAT program (HR00112490419).\n\nProject Website: http://generalroboticslab.com/AutomatedGlobalAnalysis\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/8Q5NQegHz50\n\nGeneral Robotics Lab Website: http://generalroboticslab.com",

      "title": "Why evolution rewarded ants that sacrificed protection",
      "summary": "Some ants thrive by choosing numbers over strength. Instead of heavily protecting each worker, they invest fewer resources in individual armor and produce far more ants. Larger colonies then compensate with collective behaviors like group defense and coordinated foraging. The strategy has been linked to evolutionary success and greater species diversity.",
      "content": "Would you rather fight a horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?\n\nThe question is playful and unrealistic, but it points to a serious idea: the tension between quantity and quality. New research suggests this same tradeoff has shaped evolution, especially in the rise of complex animal societies.\n\nHow ants choose numbers over toughness\n\nA study published on December 19, 2025, in the journal Science Advances reports that some ant species organize their colonies by prioritizing numbers rather than individual strength. These ants invest less in each worker's cuticle -- the hard outer layer of the exoskeleton -- which frees up valuable nutrients. Those resources can then be used to produce more workers. According to the researchers, this approach of creating many less-protected ants instead of fewer heavily armored ones proved to be evolutionarily successful. The findings help explain how individuals can change as large, complex societies develop, including those seen in humans.\n\n\"There's this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex. For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective,\" said senior author Evan Economo, chair of the Department of Entomology at the University of Maryland.\n\nIn this context, individuals can become what scientists describe as \"cheaper.\" That means they require fewer resources to build and can be produced in larger numbers, even if each one is less physically robust.\n\n\"That idea hasn't been explicitly tested with large-scale analyses of social insects until now,\" said Economo, who also holds the James B. Gahan and Margaret H. Gahan Professorship at UMD.\n\nWhy ants are ideal for studying social evolution\n\nAnts offer an unusually good system for exploring how complex societies evolve. Depending on the species, ant colonies can range from just a few dozen members to many millions.\n\n\"Ants are everywhere,\" said lead author Arthur Matte, a Ph.D. student in zoology at the University of Cambridge. \"Yet the fundamental biological strategies which enabled their massive colonies and extraordinary diversification remain unclear.\"\n\nThe research team proposed that colony size might be linked to how much ants invest in their cuticle.\n\nThe cost of building body armor\n\nThe cuticle plays several important roles. It helps protect ants from predators, drying out, and disease, and it provides structural support for their muscles. At the same time, it is expensive to produce because it requires limited nutrients such as nitrogen and various minerals. Making a thicker cuticle uses more of these resources, which could restrict how many individuals a colony can support.\n\nTo investigate this idea, the researchers analyzed a large dataset of 3D X-ray scans from more than 500 ant species. They measured both total body volume and cuticle volume, finding that investment in the cuticle varied widely, from 6% to 35% of an ant's body. When these measurements were fed into evolutionary models, a clear trend emerged: species that devoted less of their body to cuticle tended to form larger colonies.\n\nBigger colonies through collective strength\n\nWhile thinner cuticles leave individual ants more vulnerable, the authors suggest this tradeoff may actually encourage the growth of large societies. Reduced armor may go hand in hand with other helpful social traits, including cooperative foraging, shared nest defense, and division of labor, all of which tend to become more pronounced as colonies grow.\n\n\"Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,\" Matte explained. \"They're shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce, resulting in more complex societies. It's a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that lower investment in the cuticle was linked to higher diversification rates. Biologists often use diversification, which reflects how frequently new species form, as a marker of evolutionary success. Economo noted that very few traits have been connected to diversification in ants, making this result especially striking.\n\nWhy less armor may lead to more species\n\nExactly why reduced cuticle investment promotes speciation is still unclear. One leading idea is that ants with lower nutritional demands can expand into environments where resources are limited.\n\n\"Requiring less nitrogen could make them more versatile and able to conquer new environments,\" said Matte, who began the work during his master's program while interning in Economo's lab at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan.\n\nThe authors also suggest that as ant societies became more complex, group-level defenses such as collective nest protection and disease control reduced the need for heavy individual armor. This may have created a reinforcing cycle. Lower cuticle investment allows colonies to grow larger, and larger colonies further reduce the pressure for each ant to be strongly protected.\n\n\"I think of this as the evolution of squishability,\" laughed Economo. \"Many kids have discovered that insects aren't all equally robust.\"\n\nOther social organisms, including termites, may have followed similar evolutionary paths, although that possibility still needs further testing.\n\nWhat ant societies can teach us about humans\n\nThe findings also have implications beyond insects. The researchers draw parallels to human military history, where heavily armored knights were eventually replaced by specialized soldiers such as archers and crossbowmen. Economo also pointed to Lanchester's Laws -- mathematical equations developed during World War I that examine when large numbers of weaker fighters can overpower a smaller force of stronger ones.\n\n\"The tradeoff between quantity and quality is all around. It's in the food you eat, the books you read, the offspring you want to raise,\" Matte said. \"It was fascinating to retrace how ants handled it through their long evolution. We could see lineages taking different directions, being shaped by different constraints and environments, and ultimately giving rise to the extraordinary diversity we observe today.\"\n\nThe paper, \"The evolution of cheaper workers facilitated larger societies and accelerated diversification in ants,\" was published in the journal Science Advances on December 19, 2025.\n\nThis research was supported by the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (24K01785), the University of Cambridge and the General Research Fund 2022/2023 (17121922) from the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong.

The two companies are hoping to obtain approval from regulators to test the autonomous vehicles in London. Baidu's Apollo Go driverless taxi service already operates in dozens of cities, mostly in China, and has accrued millions of rides without a human behind the wheel. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said the news was \"another vote of confidence in our plans for self-driving vehicles\" - but many remain sceptical about their safety.\n\n\"We're planning for self-driving cars to carry passengers for the first time from spring, under our pilot scheme – harnessing this technology safely and responsibly to transform travel,\" Ms Alexander said in a post on X. Uber said in June it would bring its plans to trial UK driverless cars forward as the government sought to accelerate framework to allow pilots of small autonomous \"bus and taxi like\" commercial services in 2026. \"We're excited to accelerate Britain's leadership in the future of mobility, bringing another safe and reliable travel option to Londoners next year,\" it said of its Baidu partnership on Monday. Lyft said in August it would look to deploy driverless taxis in the UK and Germany as part of a European agreement with Baidu. It already operates \"autonomous rides\" in Atlanta, US - where Uber also operates a robotaxi service through its partnership with Waymo. Lyft chief executive David Risher said in a post on X on Monday London passengers would be \"the first in the region to experience Baidu's Apollo Go vehicles\". But both firms still need to convince regulators. Mr Risher said if green lit, Lyft's initial fleet of dozens of Baidu Apollo Go cars would begin testing next year \"with plans to scale to hundreds from there\". But Jack Stilgoe, professor of science and technology policy at University College London, said driverless cars \"can't just scale up like other digital technologies\". \"There's a big difference between having a few test vehicles using public streets as their laboratory and a fully-developed, scaled-up system that becomes a real transport option for people,\" he told the BBC.\n\nCongestion concerns",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Uber and Lyft, two major ride-sharing companies, want to bring self-driving taxis to the UK. These robotaxis have already been used in cities like Beijing and Dubai. The UK government is working on rules to allow these cars to drive without human drivers.\n\n**What happened** – Uber and Lyft announced plans to try out Baidu’s Apollo Go robotaxis in London starting in 2026. Baidu is a Chinese company that has millions of driverless rides in several cities. The companies need permission from UK regulators before the tests can begin. They hope to start with a small number of cars and then add more.\n\n**Impact** – This is the first time these Chinese robotaxis will be tested in the UK, showing progress in self-driving technology. It could provide Londoners with a new way to travel without needing a driver. The tests also help the UK learn how to safely use these cars on busy city streets.\n\n**What's next step** – Regulators will review safety and other rules before approving the trial. If allowed, Uber and Lyft will start testing dozens of robotaxis in London, with plans to increase the fleet over time. This trial could lead to more widespread use of driverless taxis in the future.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Uber and Lyft plan to launch Baidu’s driverless robotaxis in London by 2026, marking a key step toward self-driving public transport in the UK.",
