      "summary": "A newly identified crocodile relative from Egypt pushes back the origins of the marine-hunting dyrosaurids by millions of years. The fossil, Wadisuchus kassabi, shows a mix of primitive and advanced traits that mark a key evolutionary transition. Rare specimens of different ages reveal how these ancient predators developed. The find reinforces Africa as the center of early dyrosaurid evolution.",
      "content": "In the remote Western Desert of Egypt, where striking layers of red sandstone and green shale rise above the dry plains surrounding Kharga Oasis, researchers have uncovered a fossil that significantly shifts current views on how crocodiles evolved.\n\nThe study, reported in The Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, was conducted by a team of Egyptian paleontologists. They identified a new species named Wadisuchus kassabi, which lived roughly 80 million years ago. It is now considered the earliest known representative of Dyrosauridae -- a lineage of ancient crocodiles that differed substantially from the crocodiles seen today.\n\nRevealing the Early Marine Lifestyle of Dyrosaurids\n\nDyrosaurids did not resemble the river-dwelling species familiar to us. Instead, they thrived in coastal and oceanic settings. Their long, narrow snouts and rows of thin, pointed teeth allowed them to catch agile prey such as fish and turtles. Their ability to survive and spread in the aftermath of the dinosaur extinction makes them a key group for understanding how reptiles adapted during a period of dramatic environmental change.\n\nThe name Wadisuchus kassabi reflects both the region and its cultural heritage. Wadi (\"وادي,\" Arabic for \"valley\") refers to the New Valley, where the fossils were recovered, while Suchus connects the species to Sobek, the ancient crocodile deity. The species name also commemorates Professor Ahmed Kassab (Assiut University), whose contributions to Egyptian paleontology continue to guide and inspire future scientists.\n\nA Detailed Look Inside the Fossils\n\nProfessor Hesham Sallam, Egyptian Vertebrate Paleontologist at Mansoura University and senior author of the research, explained: \"The fossils of Wadisuchus kassabi were excavated near Kharga and Baris oases in Egypt's Western Desert. They include two partial skulls and two snout tips representing four individuals at different stages of growth, providing rare insight into how dyrosaurids developed.\" Sallam continued: \"High-resolution CT scans and 3D surface models enabled us to reveal unprecedented anatomical details.\"\n\nDistinctive Features Offer Clues to Dyrosaurid Origins\n\nSara Saber, Assistant Lecturer at Assiut University, member of the Sallam Lab team at MUVP, and lead author of the study, said: \"Wadisuchus kassabi, was a 3.5-4-meter-long crocodile-like reptile with a very long snout and tall, sharp teeth. It differed from other dyrosaurids, in having four teeth at the front of the snout instead of the primitive five, nostrils positioned on top of the snout for surface breathing, and a deep notch at the tip of the snout where the jaws met. These features show a gradual adaptation in the dyrosaurid bite, marking an important step in their evolutionary history.\"\n\nSaber added: \"Beyond the distinctive features of Wadisuchus, it plays a crucial role in understanding the origin of the dyrosaurid group. The new species pushes back evidence for an African origin of Dyrosauridae and suggests that their diversification began earlier than previously thought -- possibly during the Early Coniacian-Santonian (about 87-83 million years ago), rather than the traditionally assumed Maastrichtian (about 72-66 million years ago).\"\n\nEgypt as the Birthplace of a Global Crocodile Lineage\n\nBelal Salem, PhD student at Ohio University, member of the Sallam Lab, Curator of Fossil Reptiles and Birds at MUVP, and faculty member at Benha University, states: \"this discovery indicates that Africa was the cradle of dyrosaurid evolution, from which later lineages spread across the globe and our phylogenetic analyses consistently place Wadisuchus an ancestor of the dyrosaurid group.\"\n\nSalem added that the find carries a broader message: \"The significance of Wadisuchus lies not only in what it reveals about the evolutionary history of this remarkable group of crocodiles -- though that is a major achievement -- but also in what it reminds us of: Egypt's Western Desert still holds treasures that preserve the secrets of our planet's deep past. Our mission is not only to uncover these fossils but also to protect the fossil-rich sites from urban expansion and agricultural encroachment. They are a legacy for generations of Egyptians to come.\"",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** –\nScientists study fossils to learn how animals like crocodiles evolved over millions of years. Dyrosaurids were ancient crocodile relatives that lived in the ocean and looked different from today’s crocodiles.\n\n**What happened** –\nResearchers in Egypt found a new species called Wadisuchus kassabi in the Western Desert near Kharga Oasis. This fossil is about 80 million years old, making it the oldest known dyrosaurid. The team studied several fossil parts from different ages of this animal, using CT scans to see fine details.\n\n**Impact** –\nThis discovery shows that dyrosaurids started living in the ocean much earlier than scientists thought. It also points to Africa, especially Egypt, as the place where these crocodile relatives first appeared. The fossil has special features like fewer teeth in front and nostrils on top of the snout, which help explain how these animals adapted to marine life.\n\n**What's next step** –\nScientists will continue studying fossils in Egypt’s Western Desert to find more clues about ancient animals. They also want to protect these important fossil sites from damage caused by building and farming.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** –\nThe discovery of Wadisuchus kassabi in Egypt pushes back the origin of marine crocodile relatives and highlights Africa’s key role in their evolution.\n",

      "content": "Bryozoans sieve food particles from the water with their tentacles.Credit: Marek Mis/SPL\n\nThe Ocean’s Menagerie\n\nDrew Harvell Viking (2025)\n\nLife on Earth began in the sea. There, invertebrates emerged roughly 700 million years ago — some 200 million years before their spined cousins, the vertebrates.\n\n“The more I learned,” writes marine ecologist Drew Harvell, “about the critters in the oceans without backbones—the corals, sponges, worms, jellyfish, clams, crabs, and octopuses that make up 99 percent of diversity in the oceans—the more awe I felt in seeing the marvellous adaptations they had for getting food, reproducing, and avoiding their killers in an environment spinning with an abundance of life.” She calls her appealing book exploring this underwater universe, written after a lifetime of study, “a deep dive”.\n\nThe turning point of her career came while working on the remote Pacific shores of the Salish Sea, on the border between Canada and the United States. She witnessed that, when exposed to a predator, Bryozoa — creatures that resemble corals and are often referred to as ‘moss animals’ — grow “a forest of long, dense spines”. In other words, they shift into a form that is “as different as another species” is.\n\nHer tour of wondrous animals, from extremely strong corals to sponges that release compounds now used as drugs, shows how climate change threatens their existence. We need to conserve this “menagerie” — not least to ensure the survival of our own species.\n\nSex Is a Spectrum\n\nAgustín Fuentes Princeton Univ. Press (2025)\n\nA tropical Atlantic fish, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), launches this fascinating book about sex. Females produce eggs and males make sperm. But if the group’s largest male gets killed, a female takes over by rapidly altering its reproductive organs to become the main sperm producer.\n\n“On the face of it, sex is a paradox,” writes anthropologist Agustín Fuentes. “Wouldn’t life be easier if organisms just kept copying themselves to reproduce?” In fact, he argues, the biology of sex does not entail a binary distinction. “It’s about patterns of variation in bodies, behaviour, and lives that differ, overlap and intertwine.” And this includes humans: women and men overlap more than is generally accepted. But, he admits, there is little academic agreement about human sexual orientation, other than that it is “complicated”.\n\nHe notes that this idea of overlap goes back a long way. In ancient Greece and Rome, philosophers and physicians such as Aristotle, Hippocrates and Galen did not regard men and women as distinct beings with different biologies. Their view persisted through the Renaissance and into the early eighteenth century. Only then, especially during the nineteenth century, did the binary view prevail among scientists, epitomized in the works of Charles Darwin. But Darwin, for all his study of fishes, never encountered the bluehead wrasse.\n\nMāori anthropologist Mākereti Papakura studied and wrote about her community and culture.Credit: Mitchell Library/State Library of New South Wales\n\nIntrepid Women\n\nEd. Julia Nicholson Bodleian Library (2025)\n\nIn 1927, Mākereti Papakura, a Māori woman, enrolled as a student at the University of Oxford, UK — the first woman from an Indigenous community to do so. She and her family donated several Māori objects to Oxford’s Pitt Rivers Museum over her lifetime and after. In 1930, she died, aged 56, just before completing her thesis on Māori culture. In 2025, Oxford’s vice-chancellor posthumously awarded Papakura an MPhil in anthropology for her work, in the presence of more than 100 members of her family and community.\n\nA fascinating photograph of her in Māori dress forms the cover of Intrepid Women, a stunningly illustrated book inspired by an exhibition at the Pitt Rivers Museum in 2018–19. Edited by the exhibition’s co-curator Julia Nicholson, the book celebrates six pioneering anthropologists who did fieldwork between 1910 and 1957, when such work was frowned on for women. As Nicholson notes: “Some of these intrepid women had advantages of class, money and education,” but all faced the fact that “men held the positions of power and influence”.\n\nUnlike Papakura, the other five women studied communities other than their own for their research. Barbara Freire-Marreco lived with Pueblo peoples in the United States; Maria Czaplicka with reindeer herders in Siberia; Beatrice Blackwood with villagers in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands; Elsie McDougall with textile artists in Mexico and Guatemala; and Ursula Graham Bower with Naga people in northeastern India.\n\nMemory Lane\n\nCiara Greene & Gillian Murphy Princeton Univ. Press (2025)\n\nMolecular biologists examine memory through neurotransmitters such as dopamine; neuroscientists through groups of cells working in concert; and psychologists through organismal activity as a whole. None of these researchers considers memories to be stored in our brains in a filing system, unlike how people tend to imagine them while desperate to recall, say, a forgotten name.\n\nPsychologists Ciara Greene and Gillian Murphy’s universally appealing book discusses memory in terms of a neighbourhood, Memory Lane. It is a place that is “constantly under construction, with individual buildings being built, remodelled, and even razed to the ground”. In other words, it is a site for imperfect recollections, and memory recall is a reconstructive process. The authors’ goal “is to explain how this continuous reconstruction supports our daily activities, keeping our memories alive and lived in rather than perfectly preserved monuments to the past”.\n\nSuch reconstructions can, however, trigger false memories. Around 70% of wrongful US court convictions arise from an eyewitness’s misidentification. Greene and Murphy describe a woman who was convinced that she recalled the appearance of a man who raped her — she even picks him from a live line-up. After a decade in prison, the man is released when advances in DNA evidence identify the actual rapist. The woman, appalled by her false memory, subsequently became friends with the wrongly convicted man and they now work together to raise public awareness of misidentification.\n\nSleep Works\n\nSebastian P. Klinger Johns Hopkins Univ. Press (2025)\n\nMost humans spend one-third of their lives asleep, unaware of themselves. Before psychiatrist Hans Berger published, in 1929, the first study of electroencephalography — revealing the slumbering brain’s electrical activity — sleep science did not exist. Sleep was a mystery; Sigmund Freud excluded it from his influential 1899 study of dreams, arguing that dreamless sleep was inaccessible to science.\n\nHowever, physicians, drug manufacturers and writers, such as Franz Kafka and Marcel Proust, struggling with insomnia or an addiction to sleeping pills were keenly interested in sleep during those 30 intervening years. These groups preoccupy Sebastian Klinger, a cultural historian and literary scholar based in Freud’s home city, Vienna.\n\nKlinger’s engaging book ponders “What kind of activity is sleep? Who sleeps? How can we represent sleep?” He answers by bringing together three ways of thinking — scientific, pharmaceutical and literary. “By looking closely at the historical entanglements and interactions of these fields, we can gain an understanding into modernist culture that the familiar study of dreams does not supply.”\n\nThese connections can be disturbing. The barbiturate Veronal was sold as a sleeping aid from 1903 until the mid-1950s. The drug’s use led to instances of self-poisoning and some suicides. When a character took their own life in Hermann Broch’s 1930s novel The Sleepwalkers (Die Schlafwandler in German), “the mere mention of Veronal suffices to convey what has happened”.\n\nThe Age of Diagnosis\n\nSuzanne O’Sullivan Thesis (2025)\n\nIn 2019, the UK health secretary praised a direct-to-consumer genetic test that revealed his 15% risk of prostate cancer, and planned its widespread use. However, this statistic was not significant, given that the average lifetime risk for men is 18%, comments neurologist Suzanne O’Sullivan.\n\nHer riveting book — based on more than three decades of experience as a physician and clinical neurophysiologist — argues that new technologies can lead to overdiagnosis. Both doctors and patients often welcome a diagnosis. But it is “supposed to lead to something. Traditionally, it should explain symptoms, indicate next steps, introduce people to fellow sufferers”, she remarks. “New diagnostic criteria need to be measured more by their ability to make quality of life better—not by how many patients they can find.”\n\nPart of this growing problem is that a condition’s accepted diagnostic criteria might change over time, thus altering the number of people diagnosed with it. Autism spectrum disorder, first described by a psychiatrist in 1943, is a well-known example. Diagnoses increased by 787% in the United Kingdom between 1998 and 2018, in part because physicians expanded the condition’s range of symptoms. A diagnosis of autism is welcomed by people “who are struggling and in need of help”, O’Sullivan observes. But she also notes the “potential impact of negative perceptions” and argues that the long-term outcomes of the recognition of “mild autism in adults” should be examined further.\n\nClamor\n\nChris Berdik W. W. Norton (2025)\n\nThe World Health Organization treats noise as a leading environmental threat. The European Environment Agency reported in 2020 that noise triggers some 48,000 cases of heart disease and causes 12,000 premature deaths every year. And the American Public Health Association argues that noise might be placing more than 100 million people at risk — children are among the most vulnerable.\n\nThe underlying problem, according to science writer Chris Berdik, is that “noise took over our world while we weren’t really listening”. “Sounds can trigger a visceral, even furious response from us in the moment, but barely a shrug when that moment passes,” Berdik notes.\n\nThis might explain why audiologists often struggle to persuade people to wear ear protection. Berdik illustrates this dilemma succinctly by noting that a man working in a factory whose hearing had worsened, according to tests, agreed to protect his ears only when informed that he would lose the ability to hear his favourite sounds: the “soft, high-pitched kiss of a trout” as it takes the fly at the end of his fishing line “and the little splash that followed”.\n\nDrawing on research in acoustics, neuroscience and urban planning, Berdik’s resonant book explores a phenomenon that is both familiar and unfamiliar to us all. Will his readers learn to listen and to make an effort to reduce the noise causing their chronic stress, sleep deprivation and related diseases?\n\nCuneiform, an ancient writing system, was used to jot down anything from accounts of barley distributions (pictured) to instructions on how to exorcize a ghost.Credit: Sepia Times/UIG/Getty\n\nBetween Two Rivers\n\nMoudhy Al-Rashid Hodder (2025)\n\nCuneiform is the world’s oldest writing system. From around 3300 bc, people in ancient Mesopotamia — the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers — inscribed their notes in clay. It was used until ad 79–80, when an ancient astronomer in Uruk wrote the last known cuneiform to record planetary movements, lunar visibility and a partial solar eclipse. Inscriptions have revealed a vast collection of activities and behaviour, ranging from prosaic accountancy, dynastic information, geographical maps and scientific measurements — including the first approximation of the number π — to religious divination, love stories and humour, such as the world’s first recorded fart joke.",

      "content": "January 11, 2025\n\nIn some ways, Benin City is like dozens of other fast-growing cities in Nigeria. Buoyed by burgeoning industrial and agricultural sectors, the city’s population rose by 1.7 million people over the past four decades as its footprint on the West African landscape expanded several times over.\n\nAmid bustling new networks of roads, residential neighborhoods, markets, and workshops, lie signs of a much earlier era, when the city was the seat of a powerful pre-colonial kingdom. Remnants of ancient earthworks, thought to be among the longest in the world, can even be seen in images of the city captured from space.\n\nBenin Iya (sometimes called the Benin Earthworks, the Walls of Benin, and the Benin Moat) is a vast, cellular network of interlocking earthen walls, ramparts, and ditches that radiate outward from a central moat at the heart of the city. Built in sections over hundreds of years between the 7th and 14th centuries, the system was key to marking defensive, political, and economic boundaries and played an important role in maintaining order and stability in the Kingdom of Benin.\n\nThe OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) on Landsat 9 captured this image of the remains of earthworks on January 11, 2025. The features appear as dark green lines that trace arcing patterns in a densely settled area near the airport on the west bank of the Ikpoba River. Trees and vegetation growing in the moats give the features a dark green color.\n\nMost of the earthworks consisted of relatively narrow and shallow linear ramparts and ditches that spread widely across the landscape. Many sections have been destroyed or are too small or too obscured by modern development to be easily detected by satellites or astronauts in orbit. However, some inner sections that run through the modern Oredo, Egor, and Ikpoba-Okha areas of the city had true walls and moats and are among the most visible in Landsat imagery.\n\nArchaeological research indicates that the earthworks spanned more than 16,000 kilometers (10,000 miles) and enclosed roughly 6,500 square kilometers (2,500 square miles)—an area as large as the U.S. state of Delaware. Such length means the features hold the Guinness World Record for being the “longest earthworks of the pre-mechanical era.” By some measures, the features were together significantly longer than the Great Wall of China.\n\nNASA Earth Observatory image by Lauren Dauphin, using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

      "summary": "Archaeologists have gathered evidence from hundreds of Bronze Age sites in western Turkey that could be remnants of a civilisation that has been largely overlooked",
      "content": "Archaeologists have gathered evidence from hundreds of Bronze Age sites in western Turkey that could be remnants of a civilisation that has been largely overlooked\n\nThe archaeological site of Seyitömer Höyük in western Turkey represents a typical Luwian settlement Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, General Directorate of Cultural Heritage and Museums, Department of Excavations and Research; Luwian Studies #0255\n\nA survey of archaeological sites in western Turkey has identified hundreds of large towns that thrived there during the Bronze Age – potentially supporting the controversial idea that the area was home to a major political power that destabilised the eastern Mediterranean about 3200 years ago.\n\nTraditionally, researchers have identified several major Bronze Age civilisations that coexisted in the eastern Mediterranean between about 2000 and 1200 BC. These included the Ancient Egyptians, the Mycenaean Greeks and – in what is now central Turkey – the Hittites.\n\nBut Eberhard Zangger, president of Luwian Studies, an international non-profit foundation, has long suspected that researchers have missed something. He thinks there were a number of powerful states in western Turkey too, sandwiched between the Hittites to the east and the Mycenaeans to the west.\n\nA decade ago, Zangger presented evidence from satellite images confirming that there are plenty of archaeological sites in western Turkey that could fit with his hypothesis. But it wasn’t clear from the images exactly when those sites were occupied.\n\nFor the past 10 years, Zangger and his colleagues have been reading through Turkish language excavation reports from some of the sites, and visiting many of them in person, to get a better sense of their occupational history.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThey focused on large sites – those with a diameter of at least 100 metres – at which archaeologists have found Bronze Age pottery. A database published today provides details of 483 sites scattered across western Turkey that meet both criteria. “We are looking at settlements each with several hundred people who lived there for many centuries,” says Zangger.\n\nHe suspects that the settlements were organised into a series of small states, which he collectively refers to as the Luwian states. This invites comparisons with the Mycenaean civilisation, which also appears to have been organised into a series of small states, each with its own palace and its own king. These states have largely gone unrecognised, says Zangger, because Turkish excavators tended to focus on understanding individual sites rather than exploring their regional context.\n\nThe idea that there were small but important states in the region isn’t completely incompatible with existing evidence. “There was a major kingdom called Arzawa in western Anatolia,” says Guy Middleton at Newcastle University, UK, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The king of Arzawa corresponded with Pharaoh [Amenhotep III] and was referred to as a ‘Great King’ – one of the gang – at a time when the neighbouring Hittites were in a slump.”\n\nBut we are still lacking much archaeological evidence from Arzawa and other Luwian states, says Zangger. He thinks this is partly because many of the sites associated with these states continued to be occupied long after the Bronze Age, so the Luwian levels are buried beneath plenty of younger archaeology. “It takes you years, even decades of excavation before you get to the Bronze Age levels,” he says.\n\nIan Rutherford at the University of Reading, UK, points out that “Luwian” was the term the Hittites used to describe people in western Anatolia – but whether all of the people living there were Luwian or whether there were non-Luwian cultures there too, we can’t say without more evidence. “I’m sceptical,” he says.\n\nMost controversially of all, Zangger suggests the Luwian states occasionally formed a grand political coalition powerful enough to fight against the eastern Mediterranean’s more familiar Bronze Age civilisations. He even suspects that a Luwian coalition led to the collapse of the Hittite civilisation about 3200 years ago – and an attack on Ancient Egypt at roughly the same time. A mysterious group dubbed the Sea Peoples is often implicated in these events, and Zangger thinks they were Luwians. Many other researchers, including Middleton, argue that the story of the Sea Peoples and the collapse of Bronze Age civilisations is more tangled and complicated.\n\nHowever, Zangger thinks there is support for his idea in an unlikely place: the ancient Greek legend of the Trojan war, which is set in the Late Bronze Age. In that story, tens of thousands of Mycenaean Greeks are said to have fought a decade-long war at Troy – a site in one of the Zangger’s proposed Luwian states.\n\nHe points out that the story reads oddly if we assume that the large Greek army needed 10 years to overcome one relatively small city. He thinks the story spread in the centuries immediately following the Bronze Age because audiences at the time were aware that it referred to a larger battle between the Greeks and a powerful coalition of soldiers drawn from several Luwian states. “Fiction has to make sense,” says Zangger.\n\nJournal reference: Scientific Data DOI: 10.1038/s41597-025-06241-9",
