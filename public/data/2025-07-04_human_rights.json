      "content": "Under a deal approved Tuesday by the Georgia Public Service Commission, Georgia Power’s rates will remain unchanged for the next three years. However, the agreement excludes certain costs that could still lead to higher bills next year.\n<br /><br />\nGeorgia Power has implemented six rate hikes over the past three years. According to S&#038;P Global, the increases are part of a national trend, with utilities requesting a combined $18.13 billion in rate hikes in 2023. Energy bills vary by state and were higher in 2024 than in 2023, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.\n<br /><br />\nIn 2024, Georgia’s monthly bills averaged between $145 and $165—just above the national average. Atlanta has some of the highest energy burdens in the country, according to Georgia Tech, especially among low-income and Black households — meaning those residents pay a higher percentage of their income for electricity.",
