      "title": "Scientists may have found the brain network behind Parkinson’s",
      "summary": "A new international study points to a specific brain network as the core driver of Parkinson’s disease. Scientists found that this network becomes overly connected, disrupting not just movement but also thinking and other bodily functions. When researchers targeted it with non-invasive brain stimulation, patients showed much stronger symptom improvement than with conventional stimulation. The discovery could reshape how Parkinson’s is diagnosed and treated.",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological condition that affects more than 1 million people in the United States and over 10 million worldwide. The disease causes a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including tremors, difficulty with movement, sleep problems, and cognitive decline. Current treatment options, such as long-term medications and invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS), can reduce symptoms, but they do not stop the disease from advancing or offer a cure.\n\nAn international research team led by China's Changping Laboratory, working alongside Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and other partners, has identified a specific brain region linked to the central features of Parkinson's disease. The researchers found that a brain network called the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN) plays a critical role in the disorder. When this network was targeted using a non-invasive experimental technique known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), patients experienced more than twice the symptom improvement seen when nearby brain areas were stimulated instead.\n\nThe findings, published Feb. 4 in Nature, challenge long-standing views of Parkinson's disease and point toward a new era of more precise and targeted treatment approaches.\n\n\"This work demonstrates that Parkinson's is a SCAN disorder, and the data strongly suggest that if you target the SCAN in a personalized, precise manner you can treat Parkinson's more successfully than was previously possible,\" said co-author Nico U. Dosenbach, MD, PhD, the David M. & Tracy S. Holtzman Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine. \"Changing the activity within SCAN could slow or reverse the progression of the disease, not just treat the symptoms.\"\n\nUnderstanding SCAN and Its Role in Movement and Thought\n\nDosenbach first described the SCAN in Nature in 2023. The network is located within the motor cortex, the area of the brain responsible for controlling body movements. Its job is to translate planned actions into physical motion and then monitor how those actions unfold. Because Parkinson's disease affects far more than movement alone, influencing digestion, sleep, motivation, and thinking, senior author Hesheng Liu, PhD, joined forces with Dosenbach to investigate whether disruptions in SCAN could explain the disease's broad range of symptoms and serve as a treatment target.\n\nTo test this idea, Liu's team analyzed brain imaging data from more than 800 participants across multiple research centers in the United States and China. The group included people with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS or non-invasive therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, focused ultrasound stimulation, and medications. Healthy volunteers and individuals with other movement disorders were also included for comparison.\n\nAbnormal Brain Connectivity Revealed\n\nThe analysis showed that Parkinson's disease is marked by excessive connectivity between the SCAN and the subcortex, a brain region involved in emotion, memory, and motor control. Across all four therapies examined in the study, treatments worked best when they reduced this overconnection. Restoring a more balanced relationship between these regions helped normalize activity in the brain circuit responsible for planning and coordinating actions.\n\n\"For decades, Parkinson's has been primarily associated with motor deficits and the basal ganglia,\" the part of the brain that controls muscle movements, Liu said. \"Our work shows that the disease is rooted in a much broader network dysfunction. The SCAN is hyperconnected to key regions associated with Parkinson's disease, and this abnormal wiring disrupts not only movement but also related cognitive and bodily functions.\"\n\nPrecision Treatment Shows Early Promise\n\nBuilding on these insights, the researchers developed a precision treatment system designed to target the SCAN without surgery and with millimeter-level accuracy. The approach uses transcranial magnetic stimulation, which delivers magnetic pulses to the brain through a device placed on the head. In a clinical trial, 18 patients who received SCAN-targeted stimulation showed a 56% response rate after two weeks. By comparison, only 22% of 18 patients who received stimulation to nearby brain regions improved, representing a 2.5-fold increase in effectiveness.\n\n\"With non-invasive treatments, we could start treating with neuromodulation much earlier than is currently done with DBS\" because they don't require brain surgery, Dosenbach said.\n\nHe noted that more foundational research is still needed to understand how different parts of the SCAN contribute to specific Parkinson's symptoms.\n\nLooking ahead, Dosenbach plans to launch clinical trials with Turing Medical, a WashU Medicine startup he co-founded. These studies will test a non-invasive therapy that uses surface electrode strips placed over SCAN regions to address gait problems in people with Parkinson's disease. He also intends to explore low-intensity focused ultrasound as another non-invasive method for altering SCAN activity using acoustic energy.\n\nThis work was supported by the Changping Laboratory, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (MH096773, MH122066, MH121276, MH124567, NS129521, NS088590, R01NS131405, U01NS098969, and U01NS117836), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81527901, 81720108021, 81971689, 31970979, and 82090034), the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFE0103600), the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center; the Kiwanis Foundation; the Washington University Hope Center for Neurological Disorders; and the Collaborative Innovation Center of Neuropsychiatric Disorders and Mental Health of Anhui Province (2020xkjT05).

      "summary": "What a mother eats during pregnancy may quietly shape her child’s liver health years down the road—but new research suggests there may be a way to tip the odds back in a healthier direction. Scientists found that a natural compound made by healthy gut bacteria dramatically reduced fatty liver disease in the offspring of mice whose mothers ate a high-fat, high-sugar diet. The compound, called indole, appeared to protect the liver, improve blood sugar, limit weight gain, and even reshape the gut microbiome in lasting ways.",
      "content": "Children whose mothers eat a diet high in fat and sugar during pregnancy and breastfeeding face a greater chance of developing fatty liver disease later in life. New findings from the University of Oklahoma suggest that this risk may be lowered. In the study, pregnant and nursing mice given a naturally occurring compound made by healthy gut bacteria had offspring with much lower rates of fatty liver disease as they grew older.\n\nThe compound studied is called indole. It is produced by beneficial gut bacteria when they break down tryptophan, an amino acid found in foods like turkey and nuts. The results add to growing research focused on preventing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This form of fatty liver disease affects both adults and children, but it often advances more quickly in children and is closely linked to diabetes.\n\n\"The prevalence of MASLD in children is about 30% in those with obesity and about 10% in children without obesity,\" said Jed Friedman, Ph.D., director of the OU Health Harold Hamm Diabetes Center and professor of biochemistry and physiology in the OU College of Medicine. \"Unfortunately, the risk is higher if a mother is obese or consumes a poor diet. The disease in children is silent and typically isn't discovered until a parent seeks help for their child for liver-related symptoms.\"\n\nTesting the Role of the Microbiome\n\nFriedman led the study alongside Karen Jonscher, Ph.D., associate professor of biochemistry and physiology in the OU College of Medicine. Their work was published in the journal eBioMedicine. The team set out to explore whether gut bacteria, known together as the microbiome, influence how fatty liver disease develops.\n\nTo investigate this, female mice were fed a high-fat, high-sugar (Western-style) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. Some of the mice also received indole. After they were weaned, the offspring were placed on a standard diet and later switched to a Western-style diet to encourage the development of fatty liver disease.\n\n\"Because offspring inherit their microbiome from their mother, a poor maternal diet can shape the infant's microbiome in harmful ways,\" Friedman said.\n\nHealthier Livers and Lasting Benefits\n\nOffspring born to mothers that received indole showed multiple health advantages. They had healthier livers, gained less weight, maintained lower blood sugar levels, and developed smaller fat cells, even after being exposed to an unhealthy diet later in life. The researchers also observed activation of a protective gut pathway involving the acyl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).\n\nThe study found no increase in harmful liver fats known as long-chain ceramides, while levels of beneficial very long-chain ceramides rose. In a key experiment, gut bacteria from the protected offspring were transferred to other mice that had not received indole. Those mice also experienced less liver damage, reinforcing the idea that the microbiome itself plays a central protective role.\n\nImplications for Preventing Childhood MASLD\n\nAlthough the research was conducted in animals and cannot yet be applied directly to humans, the findings point to new strategies for reducing the growing impact of MASLD through early prevention.\n\nAt present, weight loss is the only effective treatment option for pediatric MASLD once the disease is established, and there are no approved medications. \"Anything we can do to improve the mother's microbiome may help prevent the development of MASLD in the offspring,\" Jonscher said. \"That would be far better than trying to reverse the disease once it has already progressed.\"",

      "summary": "Scientists have identified a promising new compound, Mic-628, that can reliably shift the body’s internal clock forward—something that’s notoriously hard to do. By targeting a key clock-control protein, Mic-628 jump-starts the gene that sets daily rhythms, synchronizing both the brain’s master clock and clocks throughout the body. In mice experiencing simulated jet lag, a single dose cut recovery time nearly in half.",
      "content": "A research team led by scientists from several Japanese institutions has identified a compound called Mic-628 that directly influences the body's internal timing system. The group included Emeritus Professor Tei H. (Kanazawa University), Associate Professor Takahata Y. (Osaka University), Professor Numano R. (Toyohashi University of Technology), and Associate Professor Uriu K. (Institute of Science Tokyo). Their experiments showed that Mic-628 specifically activates Per1, a core gene that helps regulate daily biological rhythms in mammals.\n\nThe researchers found that Mic-628 works by attaching to CRY1, a protein that normally suppresses clock gene activity. This interaction encourages the formation of a larger molecular complex known as CLOCK-BMAL1-CRY1-Mic-628. Once formed, this complex switches on Per1 by acting at a specific DNA site called a \"dual E-box.\" Through this mechanism, Mic-628 shifts the timing of both the brain's master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and clocks in other organs, including the lungs. Notably, these clock shifts occurred together and did not depend on when the compound was given.\n\nFaster Recovery From Jet Lag in Animal Tests\n\nTo test real-world relevance, the team used a mouse model designed to mimic jet lag by advancing the light-dark cycle by six hours (6-hour light-dark phase advance). Mice that received a single oral dose of Mic-628 adjusted to the new schedule much faster, taking four days instead of seven. Further mathematical analysis showed that this steady, one-direction shift forward is driven by a built-in feedback loop involving the PER1 protein, which helps stabilize the clock change.\n\nWhy Advancing the Clock Is So Difficult\n\nAdjusting to earlier schedules, such as traveling east across time zones or working night shifts, requires the body clock to move forward. This type of adjustment is typically slower and more stressful for the body than delaying the clock. Common approaches like light exposure or melatonin depend heavily on precise timing and often produce uneven results. Because Mic-628 consistently advances the clock regardless of dosing time, it offers a fundamentally different drug-based approach to circadian reset.\n\nWhat Comes Next for Mic-628\n\nThe researchers plan to continue studying Mic-628 to better understand its safety and effectiveness in additional animal studies and in humans. Since the compound reliably moves the body clock forward through a clearly defined biological pathway, it could become a model \"smart drug\" for addressing jet lag, sleep problems linked to shift work, and other disorders caused by circadian misalignment.\n\nThe findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).",

One promising option is partially defatted sunflower seed flour (SF), a material left behind after sunflower oil is produced. This underused by-product has shown strong potential for enriching bread with protein, fiber, and antioxidant compounds.\n\n\"Our aim was to optimize the reuse of sunflower seed flour considering its high protein and chlorogenic acid content,\" says biologist Leonardo Mendes de Souza Mesquita, who is currently based at the Institute of Biosciences of the University of São Paulo (IB-USP) in Brazil. He is the lead author of a study published in ACS Food Science & Technology.\n\nTesting Sunflower Flour in Bread Recipes\n\nTo evaluate how sunflower seed flour performs in baking, the research team prepared bread recipes that replaced wheat flour (WF) with sunflower seed flour (SF) at levels ranging from 10% to 60%. Each version was carefully analyzed for its chemical makeup, dough behavior, and the physical characteristics of the finished bread.\n\n\"Sunflower seed flour has been shown to contain a very high percentage of protein, from 40% to 66%, as well as dietary fiber, iron, calcium, and high levels of chlorogenic acid, a phenolic compound associated with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic effects,\" Mesquita explains. He adds that using this by-product increases the nutritional value of bread while lowering the environmental footprint of sunflower oil production. Because it is sold cheaply to avoid disposal, sunflower seed flour is also a low-cost ingredient.\n\nMajor Gains in Protein and Antioxidants\n\nThe results showed clear nutritional improvements. Breads made with sunflower seed flour contained significantly more protein and fiber than standard wheat bread. At the highest substitution level, the bread reached 27.16% protein, compared with 8.27% in conventional bread. Antioxidant levels rose alongside protein content.\n\nAntioxidant activity was measured using Trolox, a water-soluble analog of vitamin E that serves as a reference standard. The values recorded in sunflower flour breads were much higher than those seen in bread made entirely from wheat flour.\n\n\"The result reinforces the potential of sunflower seed flour to promote health benefits associated with reducing oxidative stress,\" says Mesquita. He also notes strong inhibition of digestive enzymes, including α-amylase (92.81%) and pancreatic lipase (25.6%), suggesting that bread containing SF or SFE may help slow the digestion of starches and fats.\n\nClean Processing and Food Safety\n\nAnother key finding involves how sunflower oil is produced. According to the researchers, industrial extraction relies on mechanical pressing rather than chemical solvents. As a result, the leftover flour is free from processing contaminants, aside from residues already present from agricultural sunflower cultivation.\n\nWhile the nutritional benefits were clear, higher amounts of sunflower seed flour affected how the bread looked and felt. When SF made up 20% or more of the recipe, loaves became smaller and firmer. Changes in crumb structure also led to denser bread with reduced softness.\n\n\"However, adding the aqueous extract [SFE] managed to preserve the structure and texture of the breads, keeping them close to those of traditional wheat bread,\" Mesquita says. He explains that this approach allows bakers to gain the nutritional advantages of sunflower flour while minimizing negative effects on texture.\n\nUsing Sunflower Extract to Improve Bread Quality\n\nThe aqueous extract is produced by mixing sunflower seed flour with water and filtering it, without requiring additional physical or chemical treatments. Mesquita suggests that future work could explore whether SFE might fully replace SF or be blended with it in different ratios. Commercial bakeries could then determine which formulations work best at scale.\n\nSustainable Innovation and the Circular Economy\n\nThis research is part of a larger effort to find productive uses for industrial leftovers. \"Transforming waste into products is a fundamental strategy for promoting a circular economy and reducing resource waste,\" says Mesquita. He notes that partially defatted sunflower seed flour supports human health while also delivering environmental and economic benefits, addressing all three pillars of the circular economy.\n\nThe circular economy seeks to move away from the traditional \"extract, produce, discard\" approach. Instead, it aims to keep materials in circulation longer, maximize their value, and regenerate resources at the end of each cycle. In this case, an overlooked by-product has been turned into a functional ingredient that enhances bread nutrition while reducing waste.\n\nResearch Collaboration and Funding\n\nThe study involved scientists from the Multidisciplinary Laboratory of Food and Health (LabMAS) at the School of Applied Sciences of the State University of Campinas (FCA-UNICAMP) in Limeira and the Laboratory of Food Technology and Nutrition at the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) on its Baixada Santista campus. Funding was provided by FAPESP through six projects (13/04304-4, 20/15774-5, 18/14582-5, 20/08421-9, 15/00658-1, and 19/13496-0). Mesquita later received a Young Researcher Grant for the project \"Sustainable Innovations: The Biorefinery Revolution through the Valorization of Macroalgae Using Renewable Solvents Toward a (Green/Blue) Economy.\"",
