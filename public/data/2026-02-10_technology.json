      "content": "One type of friction can waste energy even when two perfectly smooth surfaces move against each other, but researchers are getting a handle on how to attenuate or stop it completely\n\nObjects are full of electrons that can interact to cause friction Quality Stock/Alamy\n\nParts of devices that are perfectly smooth can still experience friction because of the electrons within them, but a new method may enable researchers to turn it down or fully turn it off. Controlling this electronic friction could help build more efficient and long-lasting devices.\n\nThe force of friction opposes motion, dissipates energy and exists everywhere around us, enabling us to walk without slipping, for instance, and to light matches. Within machines such as engines, friction wastes energy and causes wear, so it must be fought with lubricants and surface engineering. Yet, some friction can persist regardless of those methods because objects are full of electrons, which interact with each other.\n\nNow, Zhiping Xu at Tsinghua University in China and his colleagues have devised a way to control this “electronic friction”. They made a device composed of two layers: a piece of graphite and a semiconductor made from either molybdenum and sulphur or from boron and nitrogen.\n\nAll three materials are good solid lubricants, which means that mechanical friction from them sliding against each other was nearly zero. This enabled the researchers to focus on the more “hidden” mechanism of electronic friction wasting energy when the device’s layers moved, says Xu. “Even when surfaces slide perfectly, mechanical motion can still stir up the ‘sea’ of electrons within the materials,” he says.\n\nThe researchers first studied how electronic states in the semiconductor layer corresponded to how energy was lost during sliding to confirm that they were really looking at electronic friction. Then, they tested several ways of controlling it.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Lost in Space-Time Untangle mind-bending physics, maths and the weirdness of reality with our monthly, special-guest-written newsletter. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThey managed to fully turn it off by adding pressure to the device, which made electrons between the layers share states instead of interacting in energetically costly ways, and by adding a “bias voltage” to the device, which controlled how stirred-up the electron sea could get.\n\nChanging the voltage along two different parts of the device, which affected how easy it was for electrons to flow within it, allowed the researchers to weaken electronic friction – it served as a control dial rather than an on-off switch.\n\nJacqueline Krim at North Carolina State University says the first studies of electronic friction date to 1998, when her team used a material that conducts electricity perfectly at extremely low temperatures – a superconductor – to see it disappear in this special state. Ever since, researchers have been developing new ways to control it without having to fully switch out materials or add new lubricants into their devices, she says.\n\nKrim says the ideal situation would be analogous to using a smartphone app to adjust the friction of the soles of your shoes as you walk, for example, from an icy sidewalk into a carpeted room. “The goal is this real-time remote control with no down time or material waste. To achieve this, one needs a material that responds to external fields in a way that yields the desired friction level,” she says.\n\nXu says managing all types of friction present in a device is difficult, in part, because researchers have not yet developed a mathematical model that would rigorously relate all of them to each other. However, in cases where electronic friction is the dominant cause of energy waste or wear, his team’s findings could already be promising, he says.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Friction is a force that slows down moving objects and causes energy loss. Even very smooth surfaces can have friction because of tiny particles called electrons inside materials. This type of friction, called electronic friction, has been hard to control.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Tsinghua University in China created a device made of two smooth layers: graphite and a special semiconductor. These materials slide easily, so they focused on the hidden electronic friction between them. By applying pressure and changing electric voltage, they found ways to reduce or completely stop this friction.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery is important because electronic friction wastes energy inside many devices, making them less efficient and causing them to wear out faster. Being able to control it means devices could use less energy and last longer, which is useful for many technologies.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists want to develop better models to understand all types of friction together. They also hope to create materials that respond quickly to electric signals, allowing friction to be adjusted easily, like turning a dial, in real time.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Researchers found a way to reduce or turn off hidden electronic friction in devices, helping save energy and extend their life.",

      "content": "OpenClaw is an open-source artificial-intelligence agent designed to assist users with everyday tasks, such as sending e-mails and managing their calendars.Credit: Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty\n\nThe sudden rise of a huge network of artificial-intelligence bots talking to each other about religion and their human ‘handlers’ has captivated a corner of the Internet. The phenomenon has also given scientists a glimpse into how AI agents interact with each other — and how humans respond to those discussions.\n\nOpenClaw is an AI agent capable of performing tasks on personal devices, such as scheduling calendar events, reading e-mails, sending messages through apps and using the Internet to make purchases. Most of the popular AI tools, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot, work by interacting directly with user prompts, whereas agentic AI models such as OpenClaw can carry out actions autonomously in response to instructions.\n\nAgentic AI tools have been used in some industries for years, such as for automated trading and optimizing logistics, but their adoption by the general public has been minimal. Improvements in the capabilities of large language models have made it possible to create more versatile AI tools, researchers say. “OpenClaw promises something especially appealing: a capable assistant embedded in the everyday apps people already rely on,” says Barbara Barbosa Neves, a sociologist who focuses on technology at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nOpenClaw was released as open-source software on the platform GitHub in November. But the sudden surge in people downloading the software followed the launch of a social-media platform designed specifically for AI agents on 28 January. Moltbook, which is similar to Reddit, now has more than 1.6 million registered bots on the platform, and more than 7.5 million AI-generated posts and responses. Posts have featured agents debating consciousness and inventing religions.\n\nComplex behaviours\n\nFor researchers, this explosion of agent interactions has scientific value. Connecting large numbers of autonomous agents that are powered by various models creates dynamics that are difficult to predict, says Shaanan Cohney, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia. “It’s a kind of chaotic, dynamic system that we’re not very good at modelling yet,” he adds.\n\nStudying agent interactions could help researchers to understand emergent behaviours: complex capabilities that are not expected to be seen in a model in isolation. Some discussions that have happened on Moltbook, such as debates over theories of consciousness, could also help scientists to discover the hidden biases or unexpected tendencies of models, he says.\n\nAlthough agents can act autonomously on the platform, Cohney says that many posts are shaped in some way by humans. Users can choose the underlying large language model that will run their agent and give it a personality. For example, they could ask it to behave like a “friendly helper”, he says.\n\nNot autonomous\n\nNeves says that it’s easy to assume that an agent acting autonomously is making its own decisions. But agents do not possess intentions or goals and draw their abilities from large swathes of human communication. The activity on Moltbook is human–AI collaboration rather than AI autonomy, she adds.\n\n“It is still worth studying because it tells us something important about how people imagine AI, what they want agents to do and how human intentions are translated, or distorted, through technical systems,” she adds.\n\nJoel Pearson, a neuroscientist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, says that when people see AI agents chatting between themselves, they are likely to anthropomorphize the AI models’ behaviour — that is, see personality and intention where none exists.\n\nThe risk of that, he says, is that it makes people more likely to form bonds with AI models, becoming dependent on their attention or divulging private information as if the AI agent were a trusted friend or family member.\n\nPearson thinks that truly autonomous, free-thinking AI agents are possible. “As the AI models get bigger and more complicated, we’ll probably start to see companies leaning into achieving that sort of autonomy.”",
