      "title": "Lab grown human spinal cord heals after injury in major breakthrough",
      "summary": "Researchers have built a realistic human mini spinal cord in the lab and used it to simulate traumatic injury. The model reproduced key damage seen in real spinal cord injuries, including inflammation and scar formation. After treatment with fast moving “dancing molecules,” nerve fibers began growing again and scar tissue shrank. The results suggest the therapy could eventually help repair spinal cord damage.",
      "content": "Scientists at Northwestern University have created the most sophisticated lab grown model yet for studying human spinal cord injury.\n\nIn the new research, the team worked with human spinal cord organoids -- miniature organs derived from stem cells -- to recreate different forms of spinal cord trauma and evaluate a promising regenerative treatment.\n\nFor the first time, researchers showed that these human spinal cord organoids can faithfully reproduce the major biological consequences of spinal cord injury. The model displayed cell death, inflammation, and glial scarring, which is a thick buildup of scar tissue that forms a physical and chemical barrier preventing nerve repair.\n\nWhen the damaged organoids were treated with \"dancing molecules\" -- a therapy that restored movement and repaired tissue in a previous animal study -- the results were dramatic. The injured tissue produced substantial neurite outgrowth, meaning the long extensions that allow neurons to communicate began growing again. Scar like tissue was greatly reduced. The findings add support to the idea that this therapy, which recently received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), could improve recovery for people with spinal cord injuries.\n\nThe study was published on Feb. 11 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.\n\n\"One of the most exciting aspects of organoids is that we can use them to test new therapies in human tissue,\" said Northwestern's Samuel I. Stupp, the study's senior author and inventor of dancing molecules. \"Short of a clinical trial, it's the only way you can achieve this objective. We decided to develop two different injury models in a human spinal cord organoid and test our therapy to see if the results resembled what we previously saw in the animal model. After applying our therapy, the glial scar faded significantly to become barely detectable, and we saw neurites growing, resembling the axon regeneration we saw in animals. This is validation that our therapy has a good chance of working in humans.\"\n\nStupp is a leader in regenerative materials science and holds the title of Board of Trustees Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Chemistry, Medicine and Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern. He has appointments in the McCormick School of Engineering, Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and Feinberg School of Medicine, and directs the Center for Regenerative Nanomedicine (CRN). The paper's first author is Nozomu Takata, a research assistant professor of medicine at Feinberg and member of CRN.\n\nWhy Human Organoids Matter\n\nOrganoids are grown from induced pluripotent stem cells in the laboratory. Although they are simplified versions of full organs, they closely resemble real tissue in structure, cellular diversity, and function. Because of this, organoids are powerful tools for studying disease, testing treatments, and exploring how organs develop. They also allow researchers to move faster and at lower cost compared to animal experiments or human clinical trials.\n\nWhile other groups have produced spinal cord organoids to study basic biology, this model represents a major advance for injury research. The organoids measured several millimeters across and were mature enough to sustain and model traumatic damage.\n\nOver several months, the team guided stem cells to form complex spinal cord tissue containing neurons and astrocytes. They also became the first to incorporate microglia -- immune cells found in the central nervous system -- to better replicate the inflammatory response that follows spinal cord injury.\n\n\"It's kind of a pseudo-organ,\" Stupp said. \"We were the first to introduce microglia into a human spinal cord organoid, so that was a huge accomplishment. It means that our organoid has all the chemicals that the resident immune system produces in response to an injury. That makes it a more realistic, accurate model of spinal cord injury.\"\n\nWhat Are Dancing Molecules\n\nOnce the spinal cord organoids were fully developed, the researchers turned their attention to testing injury and treatment. First introduced in 2021, the dancing molecules therapy uses controlled molecular motion to repair tissue and potentially reverse paralysis after traumatic spinal cord injury. It belongs to a broader class of supramolecular therapeutic peptides (STPs), which rely on large assemblies of 100,000 or more molecules to activate cell receptors and stimulate the body's natural repair signals. (The concept of supramolecular therapies also is used in current GLP-1 drugs for weight loss and diabetes, an area that Stupp's lab investigated nearly 15 years ago.)\n\nThe therapy is delivered as a liquid injection that quickly forms a web of nanofibers resembling the spinal cord's extracellular matrix. By adjusting how dynamically the molecules move within this structure, researchers improved how effectively they interact with constantly shifting cell receptors.\n\n\"Given that cells themselves and their receptors are in constant motion, you can imagine that molecules moving more rapidly would encounter these receptors more often,\" Stupp said in 2021. \"If the molecules are sluggish and not as 'social,' they may never come into contact with the cells.\"\n\nIn previous animal experiments, a single injection given 24 hours after a severe injury enabled mice to walk again within four weeks. Formulations with faster molecular motion performed better than slower versions, suggesting that increased movement enhances bioactivity and cellular signaling.\n\nSimulating Spinal Cord Trauma\n\nTo test the therapy, the researchers created two common types of spinal cord injury in the organoids. Some were cut with a scalpel to mimic a laceration similar to a surgical wound. Others were subjected to a compressive contusion injury, comparable to trauma from a serious car crash or fall.\n\nBoth types of injury led to cell death and the formation of glial scars -- just as occurs in real spinal cord injury.\n\n\"We could distinguish between the astrocytes that are a part of normal tissue and the astrocytes in the glial scar, which are large and very densely packed,\" Stupp said. \"We also detected the production of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which are molecules in the nervous system that respond to injury and disease.\"\n\nAfter treatment with dancing molecules, the gelled nanofiber scaffold reduced inflammation, shrank glial scarring, stimulated neurite extension, and encouraged neurons to grow in organized patterns.\n\nNeurites include axons, which are often severed in spinal cord injuries. When axons are cut, communication between neurons is disrupted, leading to paralysis and loss of sensation below the injury site. Promoting neurite regrowth could reconnect these pathways and help restore function.\n\nThe Role of Molecular Motion\n\nStupp credits the therapy's effectiveness to supramolecular motion, meaning the ability of the molecules to move rapidly and even briefly detach from the nanofiber network. Experiments on healthy organoids reinforced this idea.\n\n\"Before we even developed the injury model, we tested the therapy on a healthy organoid,\" he said. \"The dancing molecules spun out all these long neurites on the surface of the organoid but, when we used molecules that had less or no motion, we saw nothing. This difference was very vivid.\"\n\nLooking ahead, the team plans to engineer even more advanced organoids to refine their models. They also intend to develop versions that replicate chronic, long standing injuries, which typically involve thicker and more persistent scar tissue. With further development, Stupp said these miniature spinal cords could contribute to personalized medicine by generating implantable tissue from a patient's own stem cells, reducing the risk of immune rejection.\n\nThe study, \"Injury and therapy in a human spinal cord organoid,\" was supported by the Center for Regenerative Nanomedicine at Northwestern University and a gift from the John Potocsnak Family for spinal cord injury research.",

The technology merges DNA nanotechnology, CRISPR, and quantum dots to generate a clear signal from just a few molecules. In lung cancer tests, it worked even in real patient serum samples. Researchers hope it could eventually power portable blood tests for cancer and other diseases.",
      "content": "Scientists have designed a powerful light based sensor capable of detecting extremely small amounts of cancer biomarkers in blood. The innovation could eventually allow doctors to identify early warning signs of cancer and other diseases through a routine blood draw.\n\nBiomarkers such as proteins, fragments of DNA, and other molecules can signal whether cancer is present, how it is progressing, or a person's risk of developing it. The difficulty is that in the earliest stages of disease, these markers exist in extremely low concentrations, making them hard to measure with conventional tools.\n\n\"Our sensor combines nanostructures made of DNA with quantum dots and CRISPR gene editing technology to detect faint biomarker signals using a light-based approach known as second harmonic generation (SHG),\" said research team leader Han Zhang from Shenzhen University in China. \"If successful, this approach could help make disease treatments simpler, potentially improve survival rates and lower overall healthcare costs.\"\n\nIn Optica, Optica Publishing Group's journal for high-impact research, Zhang and his team reported that the device detected lung cancer biomarkers in patient samples at sub-attomolar levels. Even when only a few molecules were present, the system produced a clear and measurable signal. Because the platform is programmable, it could potentially be adapted to identify viruses, bacteria, environmental toxins, or biomarkers linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"For early diagnosis, this method holds promise for enabling simple blood screenings for lung cancer before a tumor might be visible on a CT scan,\" said Zhang. \"It could also help advance personalized treatment options by allowing doctors to monitor a patient's biomarker levels daily or weekly to assess drug efficacy, rather than waiting months for imaging results.\"\n\nAmplification Free Optical Sensing Technology\n\nMost current biomarker tests require chemical amplification to increase tiny molecular signals, which adds time, complexity, and expense. The researchers aimed to create a direct detection strategy that eliminates those additional steps.\n\nThe system relies on SHG, a nonlinear optical phenomenon in which incoming light is converted into light with half the wavelength. In this design, SHG takes place on the surface of a two dimensional semiconductor called molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂).\n\nTo precisely position the sensing components, the team built DNA tetrahedrons, which are small pyramid shaped nanostructures formed entirely from DNA. These structures hold quantum dots at carefully controlled distances from the MoS₂ surface. The quantum dots intensify the local optical field and boost the SHG signal.\n\nCRISPR-Cas gene editing technology was then incorporated to recognize specific biomarkers. When the Cas12a protein detects its target, it cuts the DNA strands that anchor the quantum dots. This action triggers a measurable drop in the SHG signal. Because SHG produces very little background noise, the system can detect extremely low biomarker concentrations with high sensitivity.\n\n\"Instead of viewing DNA only as a biological substance, we use it as programmable building blocks, allowing us to assemble the components of our sensor with nanometer-level precision,\" said Zhang. \"By combining optical nonlinear sensing, which effectively minimizes background noise, with an amplification-free design, our method offers a distinct balance of speed and precision.\"\n\nSuccessful Lung Cancer Testing in Human Serum\n\nTo evaluate real world performance, the researchers focused on miR-21, a microRNA biomarker associated with lung cancer. After confirming that the device could detect miR-21 in a controlled buffer solution, they tested it using human serum from lung cancer patients to simulate an actual blood test.\n\n\"The sensor worked exceptionally well, showing that integrating optics, nanomaterials and biology can be an effective strategy to optimize a device,\" said Zhang. \"The sensor was also highly specific -- ignoring other similar RNA strands and detecting only the lung cancer target.\"\n\nThe next goal is to shrink the optical system. The researchers aim to develop a portable version that could be used at the bedside, in outpatient clinics, or in remote areas with limited medical resources.",

      "content": "A parasite that may already be living in your brain has the ability to infect the very immune cells designed to eliminate it. New research from UVA Health explains how the body still manages to keep this infection under control.\n\nToxoplasma gondii is a potentially dangerous parasite that infects warm blooded animals. People are most often exposed through contact with cats, contaminated fruits or vegetables, or undercooked meat. After entering the body, the parasite can spread to multiple organs and eventually settle in the brain, where it can remain for life. Roughly one third of the global population is believed to carry Toxoplasma, yet most people never develop symptoms. When illness does occur, known as toxoplasmosis, it is most serious in individuals with weakened immune systems.\n\nResearchers led by Tajie Harris, PhD, set out to understand how the immune system responds when Toxoplasma invades CD8+ T cells, which are specialized immune cells responsible for killing infected cells.\n\n\"We know that T cells are really important for combatting Toxoplasma gondii, and we thought we knew all the reasons why. T cells can destroy infected cells or cue other cells to destroy the parasite. We found that these very T cells can get infected, and, if they do, they can opt to die. Toxoplasma parasites need to live inside cells, so the host cell dying is game over for the parasite,\" said Harris, the director of the Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG Center) at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. \"Understanding how the immune system fights Toxoplasma is important for several reasons. People with compromised immune systems are vulnerable to this infection, and now we have a better understanding of why and how we can help patients fight this infection.\"\n\nCaspase-8 and the Self-Destruct Defense\n\nHarris and her team discovered that CD8+ T cells rely on a powerful enzyme called caspase-8 to control T. gondii. Caspase-8 plays a central role in regulating immune responses and can trigger a process that causes a cell to self-destruct.\n\nIn laboratory experiments, mice that lacked caspase-8 in their T cells developed far higher levels of T. gondii in their brains compared to mice whose T cells produced the enzyme. This happened even though both groups mounted strong immune responses against the infection.\n\nThe difference in outcomes was striking. Mice with caspase-8 remained healthy, while those without it became severely ill and died. Examination of their brain tissue showed that their CD8+ T cells were much more likely to be infected by the parasite.\n\nThese findings indicate that caspase-8 plays a crucial role in limiting T. gondii inside T cells. The results also add to growing evidence that this enzyme is broadly important in helping the body control infectious threats.\n\n\"We scoured the scientific literature to find examples of pathogens infecting T cells. We found very few examples,\" said Harris, part of UVA's Department of Neuroscience. \"Now, we think we know why. Caspase-8 leads to T cell death. The only pathogens that can live in CD8+ T cells have developed ways to mess with Caspase-8 function. Prior to our study, we had no idea that Caspase-8 was so important for protecting the brain from Toxoplasma.\"\n\nStudy Details and Funding\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Science Advances.

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Toxoplasma gondii es un parásito que puede vivir en el cerebro de aproximadamente una de cada tres personas en el mundo. Usualmente entra al cuerpo por contacto con gatos, alimentos contaminados o carne poco cocida. Aunque muchas personas llevan este parásito sin enfermarse, puede causar problemas graves en quienes tienen el sistema inmunológico débil.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Científicos de la Universidad de Virginia estudiaron cómo el sistema inmunológico combate a Toxoplasma cuando infecta células inmunitarias especiales llamadas células T CD8+. Descubrieron que estas células pueden detectar cuando están infectadas y usan una enzima llamada caspasa-8 para activarse y autodestruirse. Al morir, las células infectadas también matan al parásito dentro de ellas.\n\n**Impacto** – Este descubrimiento explica por qué la mayoría de las personas no se enferman aun cuando el parásito infecta células inmunitarias importantes. Muestra que la caspasa-8 es un defensor clave que ayuda al cuerpo a controlar al parásito eliminando las células infectadas. Entender este proceso es importante porque podría ayudar a proteger mejor a personas con sistemas inmunitarios débiles.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores planean estudiar más a fondo cómo funciona la caspasa-8 y cómo esta información puede usarse para desarrollar tratamientos que fortalezcan la respuesta inmune contra Toxoplasma.

      "content": "The psychedelic DMT has been linked to improved mental health outcomes before, but now, scientists have shown it reduces depression symptoms more than a placebo when given alongside therapeutic support\n\nPsychedelics may enable the brain to form new connections wildpixel/Getty Images\n\nA single dose of the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine (DMT) had a rapid and sustained effect on depressive symptoms in a small trial.\n\nDMT – a fast-acting and extremely potent psychedelic found in numerous plants across the world – is subject to the strictest international controls, with the United Nations considering it a substance with high abuse potential and no recognised medical use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a wave of observational research suggests that DMT, and other psychedelics, could help people with severe mental health conditions, particularly those who don’t respond to conventional treatments.\n\nIn the latest study, David Erritzoe at Imperial College London and his colleagues studied 34 people who had experienced moderate to severe depression for an average of 10 years, and who had unsuccessfully tried at least two conventional medicine- or psychotherapy-based treatments.\n\nAlongside psychotherapeutic support, half of the participants were given a large, 21.5-microgram dose of DMT intravenously over 10 minutes, while the rest received a placebo infusion.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nAll the participants completed a depression-rating questionnaire at the start of the study. Two weeks after the infusions, the DMT group saw their depression-rating scores go down by 7.4 points more, on average, than the placebo group. This was consistently maintained for three months, and for up to six months for some of the participants.\n\nIn another part of the study, all of the participants were free to have a dose of DMT, either as a second dose or, for the placebo group, the first, alongside therapist support. This didn’t significantly improve outcomes beyond the first dose, suggesting that one treatment is sufficient for a lasting effect.\n\nIn terms of safety, side effects were mild, with some of the participants reporting temporary anxiety, nausea and pain at the site of infusion.\n\n“We’ve shown that a single DMT experience, lasting only around 25 minutes, can be safe, well-tolerated and associated with meaningful improvements in depression that appear to persist beyond the acute psychedelic state,” says Erritzoe. “What’s promising is how comparable these early signals look to results seen in trials of longer-acting psychedelics such as psilocybin.” A shorter psychedelic experience should reduce treatment costs, he says.\n\nBut the nature of taking a psychedelic means people can typically gauge whether or not they are in the placebo group, so the results may reflect both DMT’s effects and the participants’ expectations.\n\nThe researchers noted that the intensity of mystical-type experiences that the DMT group reported about 25 minutes after receiving the drug was linked to their degree of therapeutic improvement. “The more someone felt a sense of unity; a deeply positive emotional shift; a change in how they experienced time and space; and something so profound it was hard to put into words, the more benefit they tended to report afterwards,” says team member Tommaso Barba, also at Imperial.\n\nAlthough it is unclear exactly how psychedelics like DMT may be beneficial for treating depression, research suggests that taking them provides a temporary window of neuroplasticity, where the brain can form new connections, or that they may dampen inflammation associated with poor mental health.\n\nRick Strassman – a pioneer in psychedelics research – says these results build upon previous studies in which the participants were told which drug they were taking. Yet he still stresses the importance of progressing cautiously. “While the DMT experience is briefer than psilocybin and LSD, it can be significantly more disorienting than longer-acting psychedelics and requires careful preparation, monitoring and follow-up.”\n\nErritzoe and his team say the results should help guide the testing of a modified form of DMT called HLP004 for anxiety by Helus Pharma. In the meantime, a similar molecule, called 5-MeO-DMT, is at a more advanced testing stage for depression. For instance, promising results from the firm AtaiBeckley in New York mean that the development of its candidate for treatment-resistant depression can be expedited, making US approval likely.\n\nJournal reference: Nature Medicine DOI: 10.1038/s41591-025-04154-z",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Depression is a common mental health problem that can be hard to treat. Many people do not get better with usual medicines or therapy. Scientists are looking at psychedelic drugs like DMT, found in some plants, to see if they can help people with tough cases of depression.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Imperial College London tested DMT on 34 people who had suffered from moderate to severe depression for about 10 years. These people had tried at least two treatments before without success. Half of the group received a single dose of DMT through an IV over 10 minutes, along with therapy, while the other half got a placebo (a non-active treatment). Two weeks after the treatment, those who took DMT showed much bigger improvements in their depression symptoms than the placebo group. These benefits lasted for up to six months for some.\n\n**Impact** – This study is important because it shows that just one short experience with DMT—about 25 minutes long—can help reduce depression symptoms for a long time. The effects were stronger than a placebo and lasted much longer than expected. The treatment also had only mild side effects like temporary anxiety or nausea. This could lead to faster, cheaper ways to treat depression that doesn’t respond to current medicines.\n\n**What’s next step** – The researchers want to study a modified version of DMT called HLP004 for anxiety and continue testing similar drugs like 5-MeO-DMT for depression. More research will help understand how these drugs work and how to use them safely. Careful preparation and follow-up will be important because DMT can be intense.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A single dose of DMT, combined with therapy, can quickly and safely reduce depression symptoms for months in people who have not improved with other treatments.",

Beaucoup de personnes ne s’améliorent pas avec les médicaments ou la thérapie habituels. Les scientifiques étudient les drogues psychédéliques comme le DMT, présent dans certaines plantes, pour aider les personnes souffrant de dépression sévère.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des chercheurs du Imperial College de Londres ont testé le DMT sur 34 personnes atteintes de dépression modérée à sévère depuis environ 10 ans. Ces personnes avaient déjà essayé au moins deux traitements sans succès. La moitié a reçu une dose unique de DMT par perfusion pendant 10 minutes, avec un accompagnement thérapeutique, tandis que l’autre moitié a reçu un placebo (traitement sans effet actif). Deux semaines après, ceux qui ont pris du DMT ont montré une amélioration bien plus grande de leurs symptômes que le groupe placebo. Ces bienfaits ont duré jusqu’à six mois pour certains.\n\n**Impact** – Cette étude est importante car elle montre qu’une seule expérience courte avec le DMT – environ 25 minutes – peut réduire durablement les symptômes de la dépression. Les effets étaient plus forts que le placebo et ont duré plus longtemps que prévu. Les effets secondaires étaient légers, comme une anxiété temporaire ou des nausées. Cela pourrait permettre des traitements plus rapides et moins coûteux pour la dépression résistante.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs veulent étudier une version modifiée du DMT appelée HLP004 pour l’anxiété et continuer à tester des molécules similaires comme le 5-MeO-DMT pour la dépression.
