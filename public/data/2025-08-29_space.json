      "summary": "OBSERVER: The EU Space Programme Explained\nsonia\nThu, 28/08/2025 - 12:42\n\nThe European Union’s Space Programme is the first integrated framework of its kind, bringing Europe’s investments in Earth Observation, satellite navigation, and secure connectivity under a unified legislation. From Copernicus data helping to monitor climate change and supporting disaster response, to Galileo signals powering smartphone navigation and helping synchronise banking networks, to EGNOS services ensuring safe and fuel efficient aircraft landings, the Programme already positively impacts the daily lives of millions of Europeans. Newer components such as Space Situational Awareness (SSA), GOVSATCOM, and the forthcoming IRIS² constellation extend that impact to space safety and secure connectivity. In this Observer, we explore how the Programme has developed, what each of its components delivers, and how new initiatives such as the EU Space Act are preparing Europe for the future of space.\n \n \nThe EU Space Programme was not created in a single step. It is the product of decades of investment and policy choices. Its roots go back to the late 1990s with the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative, which later became Copernicus, and to the early 2000s when Europe launched Galileo to establish its own satellite navigation system. In 2021 these efforts were brought together under the EU’s integrated Space Programme, which is the Union’s first ever programme of this kind. By investing in independent capacity for navigation, Earth Observation, secure communications, and space safety, the EU has built assets which underpin strategic autonomy, resilience, innovation, and competitiveness.\nThe EU Space Programme is built around four pillars: Earth Observation, Satellite Navigation, Protection of space assets and Secure Communications. Earth Observation delivers data and services through Copernicus, which provides free and open data on the planet’s land, oceans, and atmosphere as well as on climate change, emergency management and security. Satellite Navigation powers Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), which provide highly accurate positioning, navigation, and timing services. Protection and Secure Communications are ensured through Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM), and the newly initiated Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite (IRIS²). Together, they form the operational architecture of the Programme, ensuring Europe has the tools to support climate action, digital innovation, economic growth, security, and defence.\n \nEuropean cooperation at its heart\nThe EU Space Programme is the result of close European coordination and cooperation. It brings together the European Commission, which sets the political direction and manages the budget; the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA), responsible for operations, service provision, and fostering market uptake; and the European Space Agency (ESA), which provides its technical expertise in satellite design, procurement, launch and operations. A network of Entrusted Entities further supports the Programme by operating specific services or elements within the components. For example, the Copernicus component has six thematic services, each implemented by a different Copernicus Entrusted Entity.\nThis governance model allows Europe to pool resources, align priorities, and deliver space-based services which benefit citizens, businesses, and public authorities across the Union. It is a uniquely European approach: collaborative, civilian-led, and geared towards long-term resilience and competitiveness.\n\n\nDiagram showing the structure of the Copernicus component, with its six thematic services implemented by various Copernicus Entrusted Entities.

Rooted in the 1998 Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative, it combines satellite data from the Copernicus Sentinel satellites and Contributing Missions with in situ (ground, air, and sea) measurements to provide a detailed picture of the state of the Earth. Since the launch of Sentinel-1A in 2014, Copernicus has grown into a constellation which will include 20 satellites in orbit before 2030, delivering terabytes of free and open data every day.\nThe Copernicus Services transform these data into actionable information through six thematic areas: Atmosphere, Marine, Land, Climate Change, Security, and Emergency. Together, these services support a wide range of applications, from monitoring air quality and soil properties to tracking ocean pollution, mapping wildfires, supporting agriculture, and assessing climate risks. Much of this information is made available through the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE), which provides free and immediate access to Copernicus Sentinel data, Copernicus Service products, and additional Earth Observation datasets from ESA, EUMETSAT, and Copernicus Contributing Missions among others.\nThe information provided by Copernicus is used daily by policymakers, public authorities, scientists, and businesses. It supports EU priorities such as the European Green Deal, climate action, disaster risk management, and sustainable development. It also creates new opportunities for European companies, particularly SMEs and start-ups, which make up nearly 96% of the Earth Observation industry. \nCopernicus is more than data. It is Europe’s operational capacity to observe, understand, and respond to environmental and security challenges. By making all its products freely available worldwide, Copernicus not only supports EU citizens and institutions but also contributes to global efforts to manage climate change, biodiversity loss, and natural disasters.\n\n\nCopernicus, with its network of satellites orbiting the Earth, acquires high resolution images and information about our planet. Credit: European Union.\n\n\nSatellite Navigation: Galileo and EGNOS\nWhen the Galileo programme was launched, the European Union recognised that an independent navigation capacity was essential for transport, communications, emergency services, and security. Galileo was created to provide Europe with a sovereign, high-precision satellite navigation system under civilian control.\nWith a current constellation of 27 satellites, Galileo provides global positioning data with an accuracy exceeding that of GPS. It supports everything from smartphone navigation to timing services essential for banking and power grids. Galileo includes a highly-secure Public Regulated Service (PRS) reserved for governments and security actors, Galileo Search and Rescue (SAR), part of the international Cospas-Sarsat system, the High Accuracy Service (HAS), which provides positioning down to the decimetre level, and Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA), which transitioned to operational status in July 2025.\nComplementing Galileo is EGNOS, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service. Unlike Galileo’s global reach, EGNOS is a regional system which improves the accuracy and integrity of satellite navigation signals (including GPS) across Europe and its neighbourhood, providing critical integrity and precision for sectors such as civil aviation, where accurate vertical positioning is essential for safe landings.\n\n\nLaunched in 2005, Europe’s Galileo supports everything from smartphone navigation to timing services essential for banking and power grids. Credit: European Union.\n\n\nProtection and Secure Communications: SSA, GOVSATCOM, and IRIS²\nSpace Situational Awareness (SSA) is Europe’s “eyes on space”, ensuring the safety and security of satellites and services which economies, societies, and citizens rely on every day. It has three sub-components: Space Surveillance and Tracking (to safeguard satellites from debris and collisions), Space Weather (to protect against solar storms and other phenomena), and Near-Earth Objects (to monitor asteroids and meteorites). Together, these capabilities protect EU space assets from collisions and space weather, while monitoring asteroids and comets which could pose a threat to Earth. In this way, SSA contributes both to the protection of Europe’s satellites and to global safety. You can learn more about SSA in our recent Observer article and Podcast.\nIn times of crisis, first responders, military, security actors, and governments worldwide require communications channels which are secure, resilient, and accessible. This is where GOVSATCOM comes in. Developed to serve the needs of EU and national authorities, GOVSATCOM is a framework for pooling and sharing secure satellite communications capacities across Member States and EU institutions.\nRather than launching an entirely new constellation, GOVSATCOM builds on partnerships with existing national and commercial systems. It provides a guaranteed level of service, particularly in emergency, maritime, or remote settings where terrestrial networks are unavailable, and ensures the long-term availability of reliable, secure, and cost-effective communications for public authorities managing security-critical missions and infrastructure.\nThe next step in that evolution is IRIS², the EU’s new sovereign multi-orbit constellation initiative. Launched in 2022 and developed under a concession contract with the SpaceRISE industrial consortium, IRIS2 will comprise around 300 satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). Designed to provide secure connectivity for governments, critical infrastructure, businesses, and citizens, it will also ensure broadband access in underserved regions and areas of strategic interest to the EU such as the Arctic and Africa. \nIRIS² is not just a technical upgrade. It represents a major step towards Europe’s digital sovereignty and secure connectivity. By combining EU funding with private investment, the initiative is creating a state-of-the-art system which will serve governmental applications such as border and maritime surveillance, crisis management, and secure communications for EU institutions, while also enabling commercial services in transport, energy, finance, and healthcare. \n\n\nThe IRIS² constellation will consist of around 300 satellites in MEO and LEO, supported by strategically located control centres across the EU. Credit: European Union.\n\n\nLooking Ahead\nThe EU Space Programme is more than the sum of its parts: it is a strategic asset which underpins Europe’s environmental, digital, and security ambitions. Alongside the Programme, the European Commission has also put forward the EU Space Act, a proposal to create a harmonised framework for space activities across the Union. Focused on safety, resilience, and sustainability, it is designed to support Europe’s space sector as it grows more competitive and more essential to daily life.\nAs space becomes ever more central to our future, Europe is preparing to be at the forefront of this new era. With the EU Space Programme at its core, the Union is advancing with a clear focus on autonomy, resilience, and competitiveness, ensuring that space remains a driver of progress and cooperation for decades to come.\n\n\nCommissioner for Defence and Space, Andrius Kubilius, unveiling the EU Space Act and the Vision for the European Space Economy, Brussels, 25 June 2025.

      "content": "Clues about how worlds like Earth may have formed have been found buried at the heart of a spectacular 'cosmic butterfly'.\n\nWith the help of the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers say they have made a big leap forward in our understanding of how the raw material of rocky planets comes together.\n\nThis cosmic dust - tiny particles of minerals and organic material which include ingredients linked to the origins of life - was studied at the core of the Butterfly Nebula, NGC 6302, which is located about 3,400 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius.\n\nFrom the dense, dusty torus that surrounds the star hidden at the center of the nebula to its outflowing jets, the Webb observations reveal many new discoveries that paint a never-before-seen portrait of a dynamic and structured planetary nebula.\n\nThey have been published on August 27 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nMost cosmic dust has an amorphous, or randomly oriented-atomic structure, like soot. But some of it forms beautiful, crystalline shapes, more like tiny gemstones.\n\n\"For years, scientists have debated how cosmic dust forms in space. But now, with the help of the powerful James Webb Space Telescope, we may finally have a clearer picture,\" said lead researcher Dr Mikako Matsuura, of Cardiff University.\n\n\"We were able to see both cool gemstones formed in calm, long-lasting zones and fiery grime created in violent, fast-moving parts of space, all within a single object.\n\n\"This discovery is a big step forward in understanding how the basic materials of planets, come together.\"\n\nThe Butterfly Nebula's central star is one of the hottest known central stars in a planetary nebula in our galaxy, with a temperature of 220,000 Kelvin.\n\nThis blazing stellar engine is responsible for the nebula's gorgeous glow, but its full power may be channeled by the dense band of dusty gas that surrounds it: the torus.\n\nThe new Webb data show that the torus is composed of crystalline silicates like quartz as well as irregularly shaped dust grains. The dust grains have sizes on the order of a millionth of a meter -- large, as far as cosmic dust is considered -- indicating that they have been growing for a long time.\n\nOutside the torus, the emission from different atoms and molecules takes on a multilayered structure. The ions that require the largest amount of energy to form are concentrated close to the center, while those that require less energy are found farther from the central star.\n\nIron and nickel are particularly interesting, tracing a pair of jets that blast outward from the star in opposite directions.\n\nIntriguingly, the team also spotted light emitted by carbon-based molecules known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. They form flat, ring-like structures, much like the honeycomb shapes found in beehives.\n\nOn Earth, we often find PAHs in smoke from campfires, car exhaust, or burnt toast.\n\nGiven the location of the PAHs, the research team suspects that these molecules form when a 'bubble' of wind from the central star bursts into the gas that surrounds it.\n\nThis may be the first-ever evidence of PAHs forming in a oxygen-rich planetary nebula, providing an important glimpse into the details of how these molecules form.\n\nNGC 6302 is one of the best-studied planetary nebulae in our galaxy and was previously imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nPlanetary nebulae are among the most beautiful and most elusive creatures in the cosmic zoo. These nebulae form when stars with masses between about 0.8 and 8 times the mass of the Sun shed most of their mass at the end of their lives. The planetary nebula phase is fleeting, lasting only about 20,000 years.\n\nContrary to the name, planetary nebulae have nothing to do with planets: the naming confusion began several hundred years ago, when astronomers reported that these nebulae appeared round, like planets.\n\nThe name stuck, even though many planetary nebulae aren't round at all -- and the Butterfly Nebula is a prime example of the fantastic shapes that these nebulae can take.\n\nThe Butterfly Nebula is a bipolar nebula, meaning that it has two lobes that spread in opposite directions, forming the 'wings' of the butterfly. A dark band of dusty gas poses as the butterfly's 'body'.\n\nThis band is actually a doughnut-shaped torus that's being viewed from the side, hiding the nebula's central star -- the ancient core of a Sun-like star that energises the nebula and causes it to glow. The dusty doughnut may be responsible for the nebula's insectoid shape by preventing gas from flowing outward from the star equally in all directions.\n\nThe new Webb image zooms in on the center of the Butterfly Nebula and its dusty torus, providing an unprecedented view of its complex structure. The image uses data from Webb's Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) working in integral field unit mode.\n\nThis mode combines a camera and a spectrograph to take images at many different wavelengths simultaneously, revealing how an object's appearance changes with wavelength. The research team supplemented the Webb observations with data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, a powerful network of radio dishes.\n\nResearchers analyzing these Webb data identified nearly 200 spectral lines, each of which holds information about the atoms and molecules in the nebula. These lines reveal nested and interconnected structures traced by different chemical species.\n\nThe research team were able to pinpoint the location of the Butterfly Nebula's central star, which heats a previously undetected dust cloud around it, making the latter shine brightly at the mid-infrared wavelengths that MIRI is sensitive to.\n\nThe location of the nebula's central star has remained elusive until now, because this enshrouding dust renders it invisible at optical wavelengths. Previous searches for the star lacked the combination of infrared sensitivity and resolution necessary to spot its obscuring warm dust cloud.\n\nThe paper 'How is cosmic dust, the raw material of rocky planets and a key ingredient for life, formed in space?' by Mikako Matsuura et al. has been published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nWebb is the largest, most powerful telescope ever launched into space. Under an international collaboration agreement, ESA provided the telescope's launch service, using the Ariane 5 launch vehicle. Working with partners, ESA was responsible for the development and qualification of Ariane 5 adaptations for the Webb mission and for the procurement of the launch service by Arianespace. ESA also provided the workhorse spectrograph NIRSpec and 50% of the mid-infrared instrument MIRI, which was designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.\n\nWebb is an international partnership between NASA, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).",

NASA’s InSight lander detected this debris before the mission’s end in 2022. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nRocky material that impacted Mars lies scattered in giant lumps throughout the planet’s mantle, offering clues about Mars’ interior and its ancient past.\n\nWhat appear to be fragments from the aftermath of massive impacts on Mars that occurred 4.5 billion years ago have been detected deep below the planet’s surface. The discovery was made thanks to NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, which recorded the findings before the mission’s end in 2022. The ancient impacts released enough energy to melt continent-size swaths of the early crust and mantle into vast magma oceans, simultaneously injecting the impactor fragments and Martian debris deep into the planet’s interior.\n\nThere’s no way to tell exactly what struck Mars: The early solar system was filled with a range of different rocky objects that could have done so, including some so large they were effectively protoplanets. The remains of these impacts still exist in the form of lumps that are as large as 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) across and scattered throughout the Martian mantle. They offer a record preserved only on worlds like Mars, whose lack of tectonic plates has kept its interior from being churned up the way Earth’s is through a process known as convection.\n\nA cutaway view of Mars in this artist’s concept (not to scale) reveals debris from ancient impacts scattered through the planet’s mantle. On the surface at left, a meteoroid impact sends seismic signals through the interior; at right is NASA’s InSight lander. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe finding was reported Thursday, Aug. 28, in a study published by the journal Science.\n\n“We’ve never seen the inside of a planet in such fine detail and clarity before,” said the paper’s lead author, Constantinos Charalambous of Imperial College London. “What we’re seeing is a mantle studded with ancient fragments. Their survival to this day tells us Mars’ mantle has evolved sluggishly over billions of years. On Earth, features like these may well have been largely erased.”\n\nInSight, which was managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, placed the first seismometer on Mars’ surface in 2018. The extremely sensitive instrument recorded 1,319 marsquakes before the lander’s end of mission in 2022.\n\nNASA’s InSight took this selfie in 2019 using a camera on its robotic arm. The lander also used its arm to deploy the mission’s seismometer, whose data was used in a 2025 study showing impacts left chunks of debris deep in the planet’s interior. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nQuakes produce seismic waves that change as they pass through different kinds of material, providing scientists a way to study the interior of a planetary body. To date, the InSight team has measured the size, depth, and composition of Mars’ crust, mantle, and core. This latest discovery regarding the mantle’s composition suggests how much is still waiting to be discovered within InSight’s data.\n\n“We knew Mars was a time capsule bearing records of its early formation, but we didn’t anticipate just how clearly we’d be able to see with InSight,” said Tom Pike of Imperial College London, coauthor of the paper.\n\nQuake hunting\n\nMars lacks the tectonic plates that produce the temblors many people in seismically active areas are familiar with. But there are two other types of quakes on Earth that also occur on Mars: those caused by rocks cracking under heat and pressure, and those caused by meteoroid impacts.\n\nOf the two types, meteoroid impacts on Mars produce high-frequency seismic waves that travel from the crust deep into the planet’s mantle, according to a paper published earlier this year in Geophysical Research Letters. Located beneath the planet’s crust, the Martian mantle can be as much as 960 miles (1,550 kilometers) thick and is made of solid rock that can reach temperatures as high as 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit (1,500 degrees Celsius).\n\nScrambled signals\n\nThe new Science paper identifies eight marsquakes whose seismic waves contained strong, high-frequency energy that reached deep into the mantle, where their seismic waves were distinctly altered.\n\n“When we first saw this in our quake data, we thought the slowdowns were happening in the Martian crust,” Pike said. “But then we noticed that the farther seismic waves travel through the mantle, the more these high-frequency signals were being delayed.”\n\nUsing planetwide computer simulations, the team saw that the slowing down and scrambling happened only when the signals passed through small, localized regions within the mantle. They also determined that these regions appear to be lumps of material with a different composition than the surrounding mantle.\n\nWith one riddle solved, the team focused on another: how those lumps got there.\n\nTurning back the clock, they concluded that the lumps likely arrived as giant asteroids or other rocky material that struck Mars during the early solar system, generating those oceans of magma as they drove deep into the mantle, bringing with them fragments of crust and mantle.\n\nCharalambous likens the pattern to shattered glass — a few large shards with many smaller fragments. The pattern is consistent with a large release of energy that scattered many fragments of material throughout the mantle. It also fits well with current thinking that in the early solar system, asteroids and other planetary bodies regularly bombarded the young planets.\n\nOn Earth, the crust and uppermost mantle is continuously recycled by plate tectonics pushing a plate’s edge into the hot interior, where, through convection, hotter, less-dense material rises and cooler, denser material sinks. Mars, by contrast, lacks tectonic plates, and its interior circulates far more sluggishly. The fact that such fine structures are still visible today, Charalambous said, “tells us Mars hasn’t undergone the vigorous churning that would have smoothed out these lumps.”\n\nAnd in that way, Mars could point to what may be lurking beneath the surface of other rocky planets that lack plate tectonics, including Venus and Mercury.\n\nMore about InSight\n\nJPL managed InSight for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. InSight was part of NASA’s Discovery Program, managed by the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built the InSight spacecraft, including its cruise stage and lander, and supported spacecraft operations for the mission.\n\nA number of European partners, including France’s Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), supported the InSight mission. CNES provided the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument to NASA, with the principal investigator at IPGP (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris). Significant contributions for SEIS came from IPGP; the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany; the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in Switzerland; Imperial College London and Oxford University in the United Kingdom; and JPL. DLR provided the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) instrument, with significant contributions from the Space Research Center (CBK) of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Astronika in Poland.

Wolk\n\nThe inside of a star turned on itself before it spectacularly exploded, according to a new study from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory. Today, this shattered star, known as the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant, is one of the best-known, well-studied objects in the sky.\n\nOver three hundred years ago, however, it was a giant star on the brink of self-destruction. The new Chandra study reveals that just hours before it exploded, the star’s interior violently rearranged itself. This last-minute shuffling of its stellar belly has profound implications for understanding how massive stars explode and how their remains behave afterwards.\n\nCassiopeia A (Cas A for short) was one of the first objects the telescope looked at after its launch in 1999, and astronomers have repeatedly returned to observe it.\n\n“It seems like each time we closely look at Chandra data of Cas A, we learn something new and exciting,” said Toshiki Sato of Meiji University in Japan who led the study. “Now we’ve taken that invaluable X-ray data, combined it with powerful computer models, and found something extraordinary.”\n\nAs massive stars age, increasingly heavy elements form in their interiors by nuclear reactions, creating onion-like layers of different elements. Their outer layer is mostly made of hydrogen, followed by layers of helium, carbon and progressively heavier elements – extending all the way down to the center of the star.\n\nOnce iron starts forming in the core of the star, the game changes. As soon as the iron core grows beyond a certain mass (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun), it can no longer support its own weight and collapses. The outer part of the star falls onto the collapsing core, and rebounds as a core-collapse supernova.\n\nThe new research with Chandra data reveals a change that happened deep within the star at the very last moments of its life. After more than a million years, Cas A underwent major changes in its final hours before exploding.\n\n“Our research shows that just before the star in Cas A collapsed, part of an inner layer with large amounts of silicon traveled outwards and broke into a neighboring layer with lots of neon,” said co-author Kai Matsunaga of Kyoto University in Japan. “This is a violent event where the barrier between these two layers disappears.”\n\nThis upheaval not only caused material rich in silicon to travel outwards; it also forced material rich in neon to travel inwards. The team found clear traces of these outward silicon flows and inward neon flows in the remains of Cas A’s supernova remnant. Small regions rich in silicon but poor in neon are located near regions rich in neon and poor in silicon.\n\nThe survival of these regions not only provides critical evidence for the star’s upheaval, but also shows that complete mixing of the silicon and neon with other elements did not occur immediately before or after the explosion. This lack of mixing is predicted by detailed computer models of massive stars near the ends of their lives.\n\nThere are several significant implications for this inner turmoil inside of the doomed star. First, it may directly explain the lopsided rather than symmetrical shape of the Cas A remnant in three dimensions. Second, a lopsided explosion and debris field may have given a powerful kick to the remaining core of the star, now a neutron star, explaining the high observed speed of this object.\n\nFinally, the strong turbulent flows created by the star’s internal changes may have promoted the development of the supernova blast wave, facilitating the star’s explosion.\n\n“Perhaps the most important effect of this change in the star’s structure is that it may have helped trigger the explosion itself,” said co-author﻿ Hiroyuki Uchida, also of Kyoto University. “Such final internal activity of a star may change its fate—whether it will shine as a supernova or not.”\n\nThese results have been published in the latest issue of The Astrophysical Journal and are available online.\n\nTo learn more about Chandra, visit:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/chandra\n\nLearn more about the Chandra X-ray Observatory and its mission here:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/chandra\n\nhttps://chandra.si.edu\n\nVisual Description\n\nThis release features a composite image of Cassiopeia A, a donut-shaped supernova remnant located about 11,000 light-years from Earth. Included in the image is an inset closeup, which highlights a region with relative abundances of silicon and neon.\n\nOver three hundred years ago, Cassiopeia A, or Cas A, was a star on the brink of self-destruction. In composition it resembled an onion with layers rich in different elements such as hydrogen, helium, carbon, silicon, sulfur, calcium, and neon, wrapped around an iron core. When that iron core grew beyond a certain mass, the star could no longer support its own weight. The outer layers fell into the collapsing core, then rebounded as a supernova. This explosion created the donut-like shape shown in the composite image. The shape is somewhat irregular, with the thinner quadrant of the donut to the upper left of the off-center hole.\n\nIn the body of the donut, the remains of the star’s elements create a mottled cloud of colors, marbled with red and blue veins. Here, sulfur is represented by yellow, calcium by green, and iron by purple. The red veins are silicon, and the blue veins, which also line the outer edge of the donut-shape, are the highest energy X-rays detected by Chandra and show the explosion’s blast wave.\n\nThe inset uses a different color code and highlights a colorful, mottled region at the thinner, upper left quadrant of Cas A. Here, rich pockets of silicon and neon are identified in the red and blue veins, respectively. New evidence from Chandra indicates that in the hours before the star’s collapse, part of a silicon-rich layer traveled outwards, and broke into a neighboring neon-rich layer. This violent breakdown of layers created strong turbulent flows and may have promoted the development of the supernova’s blast wave, facilitating the star’s explosion. Additionally, upheaval in the interior of the star may have produced a lopsided explosion, resulting in the irregular shape, with an off-center hole (and a thinner bite of donut!) at our upper left.\n\nNews Media Contact\n\nMegan Watzke\n\nChandra X-ray Center\n\nCambridge, Mass.\n\n617-496-7998\n\nmwatzke@cfa.harvard.edu\n\nCorinne Beckinger\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama\n\n256-544-0034\n\ncorinne.m.beckinger@nasa.gov",

Today, the remains of this explosion are one of the most studied objects in the sky. NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory has been observing Cas A since 1999 to learn more about how massive stars end their lives.\n\n**What happened** – A new study using data from Chandra shows that just hours before Cas A exploded, its inside layers violently mixed.

This sudden rearrangement caused materials to move in opposite directions and created strong turbulent flows inside the star.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery helps explain why Cas A’s explosion and debris are uneven rather than smooth.

The internal chaos may also have helped trigger the star’s explosion, revealing new details about how supernovae happen.\n\n**What’s next step** – Scientists will use this new information to improve computer models of massive stars and supernova explosions. They will study other supernova remnants with Chandra to see if similar internal changes happen before explosions. This could deepen our understanding of the life cycle of stars.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – NASA’s Chandra has uncovered that violent mixing inside a star just before it exploded helped shape the supernova and its fast-moving leftover core.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Il y a plus de 300 ans, une étoile massive nommée Cassiopeia A, ou Cas A, a explosé en supernova. Aujourd’hui, les restes de cette explosion sont l’un des objets les plus étudiés dans le ciel. L’observatoire à rayons X Chandra de la NASA observe Cas A depuis 1999 pour mieux comprendre la fin de vie des étoiles massives.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Une nouvelle étude basée sur les données de Chandra montre qu’à seulement quelques heures de son explosion, les couches internes de Cas A se sont violemment mélangées. Une couche riche en silicium s’est déplacée vers l’extérieur et a envahi une couche voisine riche en néon. Ce mélange soudain a provoqué des mouvements de matière dans les deux sens et créé de fortes turbulences à l’intérieur de l’étoile.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte aide à comprendre pourquoi l’explosion et les débris de Cas A sont irréguliers plutôt que lisses. Cette explosion inégale a probablement donné un coup puissant au noyau restant, aujourd’hui une étoile à neutrons, ce qui explique sa vitesse élevée. Ce chaos interne a aussi pu déclencher l’explosion, révélant de nouveaux détails sur le fonctionnement des supernovae.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques vont utiliser ces nouvelles informations pour améliorer les modèles informatiques des étoiles massives et des explosions de supernovae. Ils étudieront d’autres restes de supernova avec Chandra pour vérifier si ce type de mélange interne se produit aussi avant d’autres explosions. Cela pourrait approfondir notre compréhension du cycle de vie des étoiles.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – La NASA a découvert grâce à Chandra que le mélange violent à l’intérieur d’une étoile juste avant son explosion a aidé à façonner la supernova et le noyau rapide qui en reste.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Hace más de 300 años, una estrella masiva llamada Casiopea A, o Cas A, explotó en una supernova. Hoy, los restos de esta explosión son uno de los objetos más estudiados en el cielo. El Observatorio de rayos X Chandra de la NASA ha estado observando Cas A desde 1999 para entender mejor cómo terminan su vida las estrellas grandes.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Un nuevo estudio con datos de Chandra muestra que solo horas antes de explotar, las capas internas de Cas A se mezclaron violentamente. Una capa rica en silicio se movió hacia afuera y rompió una capa vecina rica en neón. Esta mezcla repentina causó movimientos de materiales en direcciones opuestas y creó fuertes turbulencias dentro de la estrella.\n\n**Impacto** – Este descubrimiento ayuda a explicar por qué la explosión y los restos de Cas A son irregulares en vez de uniformes. La explosión desigual probablemente dio un fuerte impulso al núcleo que quedó, ahora una estrella de neutrones, haciendo que se mueva rápido. El caos interno también pudo ayudar a iniciar la explosión, mostrando detalles nuevos sobre cómo ocurren las supernovas.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos usarán esta información para mejorar los modelos por computadora de estrellas masivas y explosiones de supernovas. Estudiarán otros restos de supernova con Chandra para ver si cambios internos similares ocurren antes de otras explosiones. Esto podría profundizar nuestra comprensión del ciclo de vida de las estrellas.\n\n**Frase clave** – La NASA descubrió que una mezcla violenta dentro de una estrella justo antes de explotar ayudó a formar la supernova y el núcleo rápido que quedó después.",
