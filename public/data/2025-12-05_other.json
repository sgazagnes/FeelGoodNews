On behalf of Bulgaria the document was signed by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport and Communications Grozdhan Karadzhov.\n\nThis is a turning point for our region and for Europe. For decades the idea of completing the north-south axis has remained only on paper, said Minister Karadzhov.\n\nHe added that the signing of the memorandum is not a symbolic act, but a promise to open new trade routes, to overcome congestion at the borders, and to increase European resilience.\n\nAccording to him, new bridges over the Danube are needed because they are important for the entire continent, not only for the three countries in the memorandum. The Deputy Prime Minister noted that the expansion of the transport network in the region will also contribute to military mobility and will open up opportunities for investment.\n\nThe European Commissioner for Transport Apostolos Dzidzikostas pointed out that the three countries have chosen to deepen their cooperation and with this, in his words, the area between the Black and Aegean Seas will no longer be a European periphery.\n\nThe new transport links will be of essential importance for supply chains and for the transfer of troops and equipment, extending from Greece to Moldova and Ukraine, said Commissioner Dzidzikostas.\n\nHe added that a new bridge over the Danube at Ruse will contribute to mobility opportunities in the EU and NATO. Dzidzikostas explained that by the end of 2026 a plan with funding will be prepared for the projects under the next multiannual EU budget. He added that the memorandum will be politically binding. According to him, the future projects will provide the most strategic transport links in Southeast Europe. (3.12.2025)",

A changed geopolitical situation is creating new priorities, and rural regions in particular are looking with concern at the discussions on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) of the EU. In Brussels, representatives from Nordrhein-Westfalen have now strongly advocated for the future of the LEADER funding program.\n\nBrussels (enr) – From the president of the Deutscher Landfrauenverband to the vice-chairman of an Oldtimerfreunde association from the Sauerland: it was a broad coalition of actors in politics and society in North Rhine-Westphalia who campaigned in Brussels on Wednesday evening for a good future for the EU funding program LEADER.\n\nLEADER has stood since 1991 for “Linking actions for the development of the rural economy” (in French: Liaison Entre Actions de Développement de l’Économie Rurale). The program supports, for example, village communities and associations in implementing projects on the ground – as an example, the Oldtimerfreunde from Hallenberg in the Sauerland presented how, with the help of EU funds, they were able to set up a carpentry and blacksmith’s workshop in their exhibition hall.\n\nLEADER is “one of the absolutely central funding instruments for the development of rural regions,” said North Rhine-Westphalia’s Agriculture Minister Silke Gorißen (CDU). She pointed out that there are 2,700 regions with LEADER projects across Europe, 45 of them in North Rhine-Westphalia. Around 1,500 projects have been supported there over the past ten years, “mostly driven by great voluntary commitment. And every single one of these projects has very concretely led to a better quality of life in the villages.”\n\nChristina Steinbicker, spokesperson for the Landesarbeitsgemeinschaft der NRW-LEADER-Regionen, emphasized that the people involved in the projects experience self-efficacy and thereby see: “We can make a difference, we are heard, our needs are perceived.” This also helps to ensure that tendencies in the anti-democratic sphere can be intercepted by the projects on the ground.\n\nHowever, the negotiations currently pending in Brussels on the next Multiannual Financial Framework of the EU (Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF) for the years 2028 to 2034 have caused great concern among many stakeholders in the LEADER regions that significantly less money will be available for their measures in the future – because, for example, much more EU money is to be spent on strengthening security.\n\nAgriculture Minister Rainer fears cannibalization\n\nThe German Federal Minister of Agriculture Alois Rainer (CSU) said he knew “that many are worried about the future of LEADER,” and he “feared – but it must not happen – a cannibalization of the funds.” The latest proposal from the EU Commission, which provides for a fixed minimum quota for funds from the national and regional partnership plans for rural regions, is “fundamentally to be welcomed,” but can “only be a starting point for the upcoming discussion.” Rainer also called for a significant simplification of the handling of funding in the LEADER program: “So that good ideas can grow, we need above all one thing: less bureaucracy.”\n\nSpecifically, there is the prospect that the share of financing for LEADER projects contributed from national funds could rise from 20 to 60 percent in economically strong regions – a development that would affect large parts of Germany. “That is of course considerable, and it would call many of these projects into question,” said Bernd Söntgerath, head of division in the Bundesministerium für Landwirtschaft, Ernährung und Heimat, who referred to the financial situation of the federal and state governments.\n\nMartin Michalzik (CDU), former mayor of Wickede (Ruhr) and spokesperson for the chairs of the 45 LEADER regions in North Rhine-Westphalia, put it this way: “If a program is designed in such a way for the future that co-financing at the national level is to increase threefold, this will be understood by the actors on the ground as the termination of the program.”\n\nThe main addressee of all these remarks that evening was Oliver Sitar, director in the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development in the EU Commission, who was also on the podium and stated: “The importance of LEADER in Germany is obvious, also for us in Brussels.” The Commission continues to stand by LEADER.\n\nHowever, the Member of the European Parliament Peter Liese (CDU) made it clear that, for him as well, the current MFF proposal must be significantly improved before the package is put to a vote in the European Parliament: “If it is not clear that rural areas will be substantially supported, then I will not agree – and many other colleagues in the European Parliament will not either.” (4 December)",

      "content": "State Secretary of the Ministry of Transport of the Slovak Republic Denisa Žiláková claims that the Council of the EU has managed to push through that technical inspections of older cars are more in favor of people.\n\nBrussels – The European Commission (EC) has acknowledged the arguments of EU member states that for cars older than ten years, the technical inspection should take place once every two years and not every year. State Secretary of the Ministry of Transport of the Slovak Republic Denisa Žiláková said this in Brussels on Thursday after the meeting of the EU Council for Transport and Energy, reports the TASR correspondent.\n\nDenisa Žiláková recalled that the ministers discussed several legislative proposals from the European Commission, and she considers the proposal to amend the regulation on the technical inspection of passenger vehicles to be the most important. According to her, this is good news for Slovakia as well, because the European Commission initially submitted a proposal for the technical inspection of this type of vehicle to be carried out every year.\n\n“This did not fully suit the Slovak Republic and other member states, because it would mean a loss of time and would affect the wallets of Slovak citizens. Slovakia, through the Ministry of Transport, fought against this proposal and succeeded. There were, of course, several member states that were not satisfied with this proposal,” she described the situation.\n\nOn the table is a compromise proposal that technical inspections of vehicles older than 10 years should be once every two years\n\nIn practice, this means that there is a compromise proposal on the table for technical inspections to be carried out once every two years, as has been the case until now. The final wording of the revised regulation on technical inspections will be drawn up in trilogues, that is, negotiations between the EU Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament.\n\nŽiláková welcomed the fact that a proposal for digital cross-border cooperation in this area has been created, which will speed up the exchange of information between member countries. She pointed out that Slovakia, like other countries, does not yet have such a digital system, and therefore welcomes the draft regulation that requires it to be created.\n\nShe specified that regarding technical inspections, the EU Council approved, for example, that a citizen of one member country who studies or lives in another EU member state can have the technical inspection of their vehicle carried out abroad. This type of inspection is valid for a period of six months. The third part of the amendment to the regulation on motor vehicles concerned, according to her, measures that prevent unauthorized interference with vehicles, which Slovaks know under the term “odometer rollback” on vehicles. Such practices are to be prevented by the amended EU regulation. (4 December)",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The European Union is updating rules about how often cars older than ten years need to pass technical inspections. These checks make sure vehicles are safe and meet environmental standards.\n\n**What happened** – The EU Council agreed that instead of yearly inspections, cars older than ten years will be checked every two years. This decision came after talks involving Slovakia and other member countries, which argued that yearly checks would be too costly and time-consuming for car owners. The final rules will be decided soon in further meetings involving the EU Council, Commission, and Parliament.\n\n**Impact** – This change helps car owners save time and money while keeping safety standards. It also introduces a digital system for sharing inspection information across EU countries, making it easier for people who live or study abroad to get their cars checked. Additionally, the new rules will fight against illegal tampering with vehicle mileage, protecting buyers from fraud.\n\n**What's next step** – The EU will finalize the updated rules in upcoming negotiations. Countries will then work on creating the digital system to connect inspection records across borders. After that, citizens can expect simpler and clearer processes when getting their cars inspected, even if they move between EU countries.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The EU’s new plan to inspect older cars every two years aims to balance safety, save money, and improve cooperation across member countries.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – L’Union européenne met à jour les règles concernant la fréquence des contrôles techniques pour les voitures de plus de dix ans. Ces contrôles garantissent la sécurité et le respect des normes environnementales.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Le Conseil de l’UE a convenu que les voitures de plus de dix ans seront contrôlées tous les deux ans au lieu d’une fois par an. Cette décision fait suite à des discussions avec la Slovaquie et d’autres pays membres, qui estimaient que des contrôles annuels seraient trop coûteux et longs pour les propriétaires. Les règles finales seront bientôt décidées lors de nouvelles réunions entre le Conseil, la Commission et le Parlement européen.\n\n**Impact** – Ce changement aide les conducteurs à économiser du temps et de l’argent tout en maintenant les normes de sécurité. Il introduit aussi un système numérique pour partager les informations des contrôles entre pays de l’UE, ce qui facilitera les démarches pour les personnes vivant ou étudiant à l’étranger. De plus, les nouvelles règles lutteront contre la falsification du kilométrage, protégeant ainsi les acheteurs.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – L’UE finalisera les règles mises à jour lors de prochaines négociations. Les pays travailleront ensuite à la création du système numérique pour connecter les dossiers de contrôle techniques transfrontaliers. Les citoyens pourront alors bénéficier de procédures plus simples et claires pour faire contrôler leurs voitures, même en changeant de pays.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Le nouveau plan de l’UE pour un contrôle technique bisannuel des voitures anciennes vise à concilier sécurité, économies et meilleure coopération entre pays membres.",
      "personality_title_es": "La UE acuerda inspecciones técnicas cada dos años para coches antiguos para reducir costos y mejorar cooperación",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – La Unión Europea está actualizando las normas sobre la frecuencia con la que los coches de más de diez años deben pasar inspecciones técnicas. Estas revisiones garantizan que los vehículos sean seguros y cumplan con estándares ambientales.\n\n**Qué pasó** – El Consejo de la UE acordó que, en lugar de inspecciones anuales, los coches de más de diez años serán revisados cada dos años. Esta decisión vino después de conversaciones con Eslovaquia y otros países miembros, que argumentaron que las inspecciones anuales serían demasiado costosas y consumirían mucho tiempo para los propietarios. Las reglas finales se decidirán pronto en negociaciones entre el Consejo, la Comisión y el Parlamento Europeo.\n\n**Impacto** – Este cambio ayuda a los dueños de coches a ahorrar tiempo y dinero mientras se mantienen los estándares de seguridad. También introduce un sistema digital para compartir información de inspecciones entre países de la UE, facilitando a quienes viven o estudian en el extranjero realizar sus revisiones. Además, las nuevas reglas combatirán el fraude en el odómetro, protegiendo a los compradores.\n\n**Próximo paso** – La UE finalizará las normas actualizadas en próximas negociaciones. Luego, los países trabajarán en crear el sistema digital para conectar los registros de inspecciones entre fronteras. Después, los ciudadanos podrán esperar procesos más simples y claros para inspeccionar sus coches, incluso si se mudan entre países.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – El nuevo plan de la UE para inspeccionar coches antiguos cada dos años busca equilibrar la seguridad, ahorrar dinero y mejorar la cooperación entre países miembros.",
