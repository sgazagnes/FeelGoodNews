      "content": "How the US overtook China as Africa's biggest foreign investor\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Egon Cossou Business reporter Share Save\n\nTrinity Metals\n\nYou probably don't give much thought to the device that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working. But the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm. The African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems. China has long been the biggest player in the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa. Beijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission. This is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa, according to the latest annual figures. The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data. It marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead.\n\nThis American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of \"countering China's presence in strategic regions\". What does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries? Last year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals secured a $3.9m grant from the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten. \"The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,\" says company chairman Shawn McCormick. Trinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania. Mr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US. \"This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market.\" Trinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder. Mr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards. \"We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity\".\n\nAFP via Getty Images The African continent is home to vast mineral wealth\n\nSepo Haimambo is an economist at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours. \"To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,\" she says. \"So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants.\" Ms Haimambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. \"There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,\" she says. \"You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc.\" She also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative.\n\nSepo Haimambo Economist Sepo Haimambo says that African nations must be careful to secure good deals with the US",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Africa has many important minerals like lithium, cobalt, and tungsten that are needed to make technology such as smartphones, electric cars, and computers. Both the US and China want access to these minerals because they are important for modern devices and industries.\n\n**What happened** – In 2023, the US invested $7.8 billion in Africa, more than China’s $4 billion, making the US the biggest foreign investor on the continent for the first time since 2012. This investment is led by the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), a government agency created in 2019 to compete with China in key regions. For example, the Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals received $3.9 million from the DFC to develop mines that produce minerals like tin and tungsten, which are then processed in the US.\n\n**Impact** – This shift means more money is going into African mining companies that follow high ethical and environmental standards, creating jobs and supporting local communities. African countries now have better opportunities to negotiate deals that benefit their economies and possibly keep more mineral processing and profits within Africa instead of just exporting raw materials.\n\n**What’s next step** – African nations are encouraged to prepare well for negotiations with US investors and explore new types of agreements, such as joint ventures or local ownership, to increase benefits. There is also hope that more mineral processing will happen in Africa, which could lead to more jobs and money staying in the region to support education, healthcare, and other development projects.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The US has become Africa’s largest foreign investor by supporting ethical mining of critical minerals, opening new opportunities for African economic growth and development.",

      "content": "Thousands of holes arranged in a snake-like pattern on Monte Sierpe in Peru could have been a monumental accounting device for trade and tax\n\nAerial photo of the Band of Holes in Monte Sierpe, Peru J.L. Bongers\n\nA hillside in Peru covered by more than 5000 aligned holes may have been a giant Inca accounting device – a spreadsheet, but on a monumental scale.\n\nTracing across the slopes of Monte Sierpe (Serpent Mountain) in a snake-like shape, the “Band of Holes” has mystified archaeologists since an aerial photo of it was published in 1933. Various hypotheses have been put forward for the holes’ purpose, including suggestions that they are graves or defensive structures, or were used for water storage or gardening during the Inca Empire, which ran from 1438 to 1533.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This 1.5-kilometre-long band of holes has baffled people for decades,” says Jacob Bongers at the University of Sydney.\n\nTo get a clearer idea of the purpose of the holes, Bongers and his colleagues analysed sediment samples from within 19 holes and used drones to provide the clearest aerial picture yet of the array of depressions, which are each about 1 to 2 metres across and between 50 centimetres and 1 metre deep.\n\nThe analysis revealed pollen from food crops, including maize, amaranth, chilli peppers and sweet potato, and from wild plants such as Typha (bulrush), which are traditionally used for constructing baskets and rafts.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThe holes are too far from the fertile areas where the plants would grow for the pollen to have been delivered by wind, says Bongers. He suggests that local groups from the Chincha culture – which lasted from about AD 900 to 1450 – lined the holes with plant materials and deposited goods in them, brought up in woven baskets loaded onto llamas.\n\n“The data support the idea that people brought goods to the site and deposited them in the holes,” he says, and the use of baskets would also explain why there isn’t much pottery at the site. “We think it was initially a barter marketplace. That was then turned into a sort of large-scale accounting device under the Inca.”\n\nAround 1480, the Chincha came under Inca rule, retaining their autonomy, but historical sources indicate they also paid levies, says Bongers. The accounting device idea comes from the aerial imagery, which allowed a more precise counting of the number of holes – revealing there are about 5200 of them – and of the variation in their layout.\n\nThe holes are organised into at least 60 sections or blocks. The researchers say their layout mirrors some Inca counting devices made from knotted strings, known as khipus, which have been compared to calculators or abacuses. But Bongers says a better analogy for the hole layout might be a spreadsheet to record the collection of tributes of food or goods from local communities.\n\nA group of holes at Monte Sierpe, Peru C. Stanish\n\n“There are these interesting mathematical patterns. You have some [sections with] multiple rows of eight holes, and then you have other sections that have alternating counts. Eight holes, then seven, then eight and seven, then eight. It hints that there was some sort of intention behind it,” says Bongers.\n\nHe thinks the different sections correspond to distinct groups of people from the heavily populated and productive agricultural region around Monte Sierpe. Sources suggest some 100,000 people lived in the neighbouring Pisco and Chincha valleys, he says.\n\nThe particular khipu said to resemble the layout of the holes was found in the Pisco valley, and is divided into sections approximately similar to the holes at the site, but that khipu has 80 divisions overall.\n\n“The 5200 holes are certainly big enough to put goods into, but they are not arranged in a clear-cut decimal pattern and the Inca had a decimal system, so I would expect things to be strongly organised in groups of 10,” says Karenleigh Overmann at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. “The holes are organised into 60-some sections and the khipu is organised into 80, and that’s a pretty big difference in numbers.”\n\nBongers accepts that, but adds that we don’t actually know over what period of time the site was built, and the layout or use of holes might have evolved, along with any matching khipus. “We’re seeing the final form, but it could have started out as just a couple of sections and changed over time with the population,” he says.\n\nThe goods might have been gathered here rather than in an urban area because it is near the intersection of a network of pre-Hispanic roads, and in between two major Inca administrative sites: Tambo Colorado and Lima La Vieja.\n\nOvermann says the study does a good job of looking at and discounting alternative ideas for the purpose of the holes, but she says there might be a simpler explanation. “There is a lot of tradition in Peru of making giant petroglyphs that can be seen from a distance,” she says. “Maybe they were just doing that.”\n\nThat could indeed have been one purpose, says Bongers. “But two things can be true at the same time. It’s a big, giant snake, but it served a functional purpose, so I see this site as a sort of social technology. They didn’t have internet, they didn’t have cell phones, so how are people figuring out when and where to meet? Let’s build a giant site that you can see from kilometres away.”",
