      "content": "Dame Jane Goodall remembered as a 'true hero for the planet'\n\n52 minutes ago Share Save Maia Davies BBC News and Harry Sekulich BBC News Share Save\n\nWatch: Jane Goodall tells BBC how she became interested in animals\n\nConservationist Dame Jane Goodall, a world-leading expert on chimpanzees, has died aged 91. Former US president Barack Obama was among those who paid tribute to Dr Goodall, who he said, \"opened doors for generations of women in science\". Actor and environmental campaigner Leonardo DiCaprio said that she \"inspired millions to care, to act, and to hope\", and called her a \"a true hero for the planet\". Dr Goodall died of natural causes while in California on a speaking tour of the US, according to a statement from the Jane Goodall Institute. It said her discoveries \"revolutionised science\" and that she was \"a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world\".\n\nThe United Nations said it mourned the loss of Dr Goodall, saying that she \"worked tirelessly for our planet and all its inhabitants, leaving an extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature\". Greenpeace said it was \"heartbroken\" by her death, calling her \"one of the true conservation giants of our time\". Its co-executive director in the UK, Will McCallum, said: \"Dr Goodall's legacy is not only in science but in the global movement she helped spark to protect nature and give hope for a better world.\" Dame Jane Goodall revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins Naturalist Chris Packham told the BBC that he counted her among his heroes, calling her \"revolutionary\" and \"remarkable\". \"To have lost a hero at a time when we need all of them on the frontline fighting for life on earth is a tragedy.\"\n\nGetty Images Dr Jane Goodall observing a chimpanzee in Tanzania in 1987\n\nBorn in 1934 and raised in London, Dr Goodall said she became fascinated by animals after reading books like The Story of Dr Doolittle and Tarzan. She met leading primatologist Prof Louis Leakey while staying on a friend's farm in Kenya in her mid-twenties. Although she had no qualifications, Mr Leakey saw her potential and helped arrange her first research trip to the jungles of Tanzania in 1960. That year, she became the first person to record witnessing an animal using a tool - a large male chimpanzee, who she had named David Greybeard, digging termites out of a mound with a stick. Until then, it was thought only humans were intelligent enough to do so. Her observations challenged years of conventional scientific thinking and shaped the future of evolutionary science. Her work was published in leading journals, and in 1965 she made the front cover of National Geographic, introducing the world to the emotional and social lives of the primates.\n\nGetty Images She featured in 'Miss Goodall and the World of Chimpanzees', narrated by Orson Welles and first broadcast in 1965\n\nShe revealed that the animals form strong family bonds and even engage in warfare over territory. She featured in a television documentary narrated by Orson Welles, which saw her playing and wrestling with baby chimps. Her approach - associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \"my friends\" - was scoffed at by some, mostly male, scientists at the time. She undertook a PhD based on her findings, despite not having an undergraduate degree or any prior scientific training. After her experiences in the field she became an activist, working to free chimpanzees kept in zoos or in captivity for medical research, and later urged action on climate change in the face of widespread habitat devastation. She told the BBC in 2024: \"We're in the midst of the sixth great extinction... the more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better.\" Asked what kept her motivated late in life, she said: \"Surely people want a future for their children.\"\n\nGetty Images Dr Goodall advocated for the protection of chimpanzees, including a campaign by the World Wildlife Fund in 1985\n\nHer Jane Goodall Institute, founded in 1977, works to protect chimpanzees and supports projects aimed at benefiting animals and the environment. Dr Goodall was appointed a Dame in 2003 and received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2025. She was known for travelling constantly for her work, telling the Times newspaper in 2022 that she had not slept in the same bed for more than three weeks since 1986. Dr Goodall worked right up until her death, being interviewed on stage in New York a week ago. She was due to speak again at a sold-out event on 3 October in California.\n\nPA Media Tributes have poured in for Dame Jane from across the globe, praising her advocacy and \"compassion\"",

      "summary": "Fungi may have shaped Earth’s landscapes long before plants appeared. By combining rare gene transfers with fossil evidence, researchers have traced fungal origins back nearly a billion years earlier than expected. These ancient fungi may have partnered with algae, recycling nutrients, breaking down rock, and creating primitive soils. Far from being silent background players, fungi were ecosystem engineers that prepared Earth’s surface for plants, fundamentally altering the course of life’s history.",
      "content": "New research published in Nature Ecology & Evolution sheds light on the timelines and pathways of evolution of fungi, finding evidence of their influence on ancient terrestrial ecosystems. The study, led by researchers from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and collaborators, indicates the diversification of fungi hundreds of millions of years before the emergence of land plants.\n\nThe five paths to a complex world\n\nProfessor Gergely J. Szöllősi, author on this study and head of the Model-Based Evolutionary Genomics Unit at OIST explains the foundations of this research. \"Complex multicellular life -- organisms made of many cooperating cells with specialized jobs -- evolved independently in five major groups: animals, land plants, fungi, red algae, and brown algae. On a planet once dominated by single-celled organisms, a revolutionary change occurred not once, but at least five separate times: the evolution of complex multicellular life. Understanding when these groups emerged is fundamental to piecing together the history of life on Earth.\"\n\nEmergence here was not simply a matter of cells clumping together; it was the dawn of organisms, where cells took on specialized jobs and were organized into distinct tissues and organs, much like in our own bodies. This evolutionary leap required sophisticated new tools, including highly developed mechanisms for cells to adhere to one another and intricate systems for them to communicate across the organism, and arose independently in each of the five major groups.\n\nThe difficulties of dating evolutionary divergence\n\nFor most of these groups, the fossil record acts as a geological calendar, providing anchor points in deep time. For example, red algae show up possibly as early as about 1.6 billion years ago (in candidate seaweed-like fossils from India); animals appear by around 600 million years ago (Ediacaran fossils such as the quilted pancake like Dickinsonia); land plants take root roughly 470 million years ago (tiny fossil spores); and brown algae (kelp-like forms) diversified tens to hundreds of millions of years later still. Based on this evidence, a chronological picture of life's complexity emerges.\n\nThere is, however, a notable exception to this fossil-based timeline: fungi. The fungal kingdom has long been an enigma for paleontologists. Their typically soft, filamentous bodies mean they rarely fossilize well. Furthermore, unlike animals or plants, which appear to have a single origin of complex multicellularity, fungi evolved this trait multiple times from diverse unicellular ancestors, making it difficult to pinpoint a single origin event in the sparse fossil record.\n\nReading the genetic clock\n\nTo overcome the gaps in the fungal fossil record, scientists use a \"molecular clock.\" The concept is that genetic mutations accumulate in an organism's DNA at a relatively steady rate over generations, like the ticking of a clock. By comparing the number of genetic differences between two species, researchers can estimate how long ago they diverged from a common ancestor.\n\nHowever, a molecular clock is uncalibrated; it can reveal relative time but not absolute years. To set the clock, scientists need to calibrate it with \"anchor points\" from the fossil record. Given the scarcity of fungal fossils, this has always been a major challenge. The OIST-led team addressed this by incorporating a novel source of information: rare gene \"swaps\" between different fungal lineages, a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT).\n\nProf. Szöllősi explains this concept. \"While genes are normally passed down \"vertically\" from parent to child, HGT is like a gene jumping \"sideways\" from one species to another. These events provide powerful temporal clues,\" he says. \"If a gene from lineage A is found to have jumped into lineage B, it establishes a clear rule: the ancestors of lineage A must be older than the descendants of lineage B.\"\n\nBy identifying 17 such transfers, the team established a series of \"older than/younger than\" relationships that, alongside fossil records, helped to tighten and constrain the fungal timeline.\n\nA new history for an ancient kingdom\n\nThe analysis suggests a common ancestor of living fungi dating to roughly 1.4-0.9 billion years ago -- well before land plants. That timing supports a long prelude of fungi-algae interactions that helped set the stage for life on land.\n\nCo-first author on this study, Dr. Lénárd L. Szánthó, emphasizes the importance of these findings. \"Fungi run ecosystems -- recycling nutrients, partnering with other organisms, and sometimes causing disease. Pinning down their timeline shows fungi were diversifying long before plants, consistent with early partnerships with algae that likely helped pave the way for terrestrial ecosystems.\"\n\nThis revised timeline fundamentally reframes the story of life's colonization of land. It suggests that for hundreds of millions of years before the first true plants took root, fungi were already present, likely interacting with algae in microbial communities. This long, preparatory phase may have been essential for making Earth's continents habitable. By breaking down rock and cycling nutrients, these ancient fungi could have been the first true ecosystem engineers, creating the first primitive soils and fundamentally altering the terrestrial environment. In this new view, plants did not colonize a barren wasteland, but rather a world that had been prepared for them over eons by the ancient and persistent activity of the fungal kingdom.\n\nAbout the authors\n\nThis work grew from the OIST Model-Based Evolutionary Genomics Unit, co-led by Prof. Gergely J. Szöllősi and Dr. Eduard Ocaña-Pallarès, with Dr. Lénárd L. Szánthó and Zsolt Merényi as first authors. They teamed up with colleagues across Europe, including Professor László G. Nagy's group, which includes Zsolt Merényi, at the HUN-REN Biological Research Centre in Szeged, Hungary -- a team known for fungal evolutionary genomics and the evolution of multicellularity.

      "summary": "As more electric vehicles hit the road, the temptation is to invest heavily in the infrastructure — roads, highways, parking lots — that will preserve the status quo of prioritizing cars over people. Meanwhile, the e-bike market is skyrocketing — and, according to some studies, outpacing electric cars — providing an even more environmentally friendly travel option. The question now is: Do officials double down on deadly car-centric urban design, or do they rethink cities to encourage people to ditch four wheels for two?",
      "content": "Last year, San Francisco voters did something exceedingly rare in car-crazy America: They closed two miles of a coastal highway to vehicles, creating a sprawling park for pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists. Of course, furious residents in the neighborhood bordering the erstwhile highway voted last month to recall their representative at City Hall for championing the transformation and, to their minds, creating a traffic nightmare on side streets — even though commute times in the area have grown by just a few minutes since the closure.\n\nThe battle in the City by the Bay is emblematic of the inflection point facing cities nationally. As more electric vehicles hit the road, the temptation is to invest heavily in the infrastructure — roads, highways, parking lots — that will preserve the status quo of prioritizing cars over people. Meanwhile, the e-bike market is skyrocketing — and, according to some studies, outpacing electric cars — providing an even more environmentally friendly travel option. The question now is: Do officials double down on deadly car-centric urban design, or do they rethink cities to encourage people to ditch four wheels for two?\n\nCities and states throughout the country are taking steps to make existing infrastructure more accommodating to those who prefer to pedal. They are lowering vehicle speed limits, building designated bike lanes, providing charging, and ensuring underserved neighborhoods don’t get left behind. All of this has been a big change in just the past few years, given that some locales didn’t regulate e-bikes at all until the late 2010s, said Leigh Ann Von Hagen, director of the Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. “All states have seen the writing on the wall,” she said.\n\nThe promise of the e-bike is that it can help people of every age. Parents are carting children around on beefy models with built-in bins. Workers can use them to get to and from their jobs. Shoppers can slap saddle bags over the rear fender to haul groceries. And elderly folks, who may not be confident in their ability to operate a conventional pedaller, can use them in lieu of driving. “I have an uncle in Tennessee who started riding an e-bike when he retired because he just didn’t want to drive to the store anymore,” Von Hagen said.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nIn addition to that lowering of carbon emissions — how much exactly will depend on the city and the rate of e-bike adoption, but the drop may be somewhere around 12 percent — there’s also the harder-to-quantify health benefits of people exercising more. Plus, fewer cars spewing pollution improves air quality and public health. EVs, too, release their own form of pollution: Because they’re heavier than combustion cars, their tires produce more microplastics — though their brakes produce much less dust — that sully the air and wash out to sea.\n\nDrivers may experience range anxiety about their electric vehicle not having the juice to reach their destination, but the opposite is true for e-bikers. Older people or those with medical conditions might avoid conventional cycling because they worry about having the energy to make it somewhere, especially if there are hills in their way. With e-bike ranges far exceeding the average distance that riders are traveling (around 6 miles), range anxiety can be higher for those providing their own pedalling power. “When we do interviews with people, they will use the e-bike on eco, or even off, when they’re on flat terrain, and as soon as they get to that hill, they consistently report putting it up to the maximum,” said Jessica Bourne, an active travel researcher at the University of Bristol in the U.K. “As one participant described it: It’s just flattening their journey.”\n\nYou can see the potential for e-bikes to replace cars in how their riders compare to those on conventional bikes. Given that e-bike users have the option to let the motor do all the work, you might assume that they’re burning fewer calories. But research has shown that riders tend to travel significantly farther on e-bikes, meaning they’re getting about as much physical activity as those taking shorter trips on conventional bikes.\n\nPut another way: It’s less exertion, but more time spent exercising and running errands. “Once you account for increased frequency and increased duration and distance traveled, they spend longer on the bike overall, so they’re actually expending more energy on a weekly basis,” Bourne said. “That’s why they have more potential to substitute for motorized vehicles.”\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nIndeed, several studies have shown that people are already replacing car trips with e-bike rides on a wide scale. And the more bike-friendly cities make themselves, the more people opt for two wheels: Between 2009 and 2014, commuting by conventional bikes and electric versions doubled in New York City and Washington D.C., thanks in part to better bicycle infrastructure. E-bike sales in North America doubled between 2018 and 2021. (So too have e-bike and e-scooter related injuries increased, due largely to insufficient and unsafe infrastructure for riders.)\n\nEstablished cycling havens like the Netherlands — where the average person rides 680 miles a year, despite the chill of winter — show just how much the built environment can influence travel choices. “In the Netherlands, we say there’s no bad weather — there’s only bad clothing,” said Joost de Kruijf, a travel behavior researcher at Dutch Cycling Intelligence. “Once you reach a kind of threshold where you do all your trips by bicycle, then it just becomes a habit.”\n\nThe challenge, though, is that e-bikes remain expensive — anywhere from around $1,000 to over ten times that amount — putting them out of reach for the people who could benefit the most. Low-income folks without cars would get access to more employment opportunities if they had e-bikes, Bourne said, because they would be able to travel farther with more ease. Similarly, young people would have greater access to education opportunities at colleges beyond walking distance or transit routes. That’s especially true for people living car-free somewhere with poor public transportation, a problem known to researchers as transport poverty.\n\nThe solution, Bourne said, is to subsidize e-bikes. California, for instance, has provided up to $2,000 for low-income residents to buy them, though the program is no longer accepting applications. Denver has offered similar support. “If it’s going to benefit the planet and it’s going to reduce the cars on the road, then why don’t we provide the subsidies for e-bikes, as we do for electric cars?” Bourne asked. “It just seems bananas to me.”\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that rebates incentivizing EV purchases and rebates that incentivize e-bikes can be equally effective, both costing about a dollar per ton of avoided carbon dioxide emissions, at least in British Columbia. “The big difference is electric bike incentives come with a whole range of other co-benefits,” said Alex Bigazzi, a researcher in transportation engineering and planning at the University of British Columbia. “Whereas electric car incentives actually have some downsides, because we know it incentivizes even more driving, which makes congestion worse, and leads to more sedentary lifestyles, and leads to higher infrastructure costs.” (Some research has shown what’s called a rebound effect: Because electric vehicles are cheaper to operate, there can be a modest increase in total vehicle miles traveled.)\n\nIndeed, in a report published last week, Bigazzi found that an e-bike rebate program in British Columbia helped recipients increase their cycling by 25 miles per week and reduce their car use by almost 11 miles. That, in turn, reduced emissions from travel by 17 percent per year, and increased physical activity during travel by 13 percent. Denver has said its popular e-bike voucher program has helped eliminate 170,000 vehicle miles traveled each week.\n\nExperts say cities could also start to think about bike-share programs as an extension of their public transportation systems. “It really is a public benefit to get people from point A to point B without needing to park or drive a car,” said Kendra Ramsey, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition. “There is an argument that having some sort of public subsidy, like public transit does, could greatly increase the number of folks that are able to use those systems.”\n\nCities where those programs already exist have seen success. Citi Bike in New York, run by the rideshare company Lyft, can be a model. With over a million riders every year, the program, which provides e-bikes and conventional bikes, is an accessible part of the city’s infrastructure.\n\nBeyond making the bikes accessible, though, lies the challenge of making cities accessible for bikes. “I think the infrastructure needs to be somehow retrofitted for these faster mobility devices,” said Greg Rybarczyk, a professor at the University of Michigan-Flint, who studies e-mobility in the Detroit metro area. Making sure bikers know the rules of the road — and drivers know how to handle bikers — is critical, too. “I think there’s a long way to go in terms of driver education and marketing campaigns,” Rybarczyk said.\n\nEven in Detroit, a historic center of American car manufacturing and car culture, e-bikes are picking up speed. But respondents to an e-bike user survey Rybarczyk conducted said that Detroit’s bike lanes aren’t well-maintained, putting them in unsafe situations. “The street sweepers don’t sweep the bike lanes. They don’t sweep the curbs as much. There’s a lot of debris on a lot of the routes in and around Detroit.” Maintaining — and, potentially, widening — bike lanes could do a great deal for e-bike users outside of the coastal megacities. So, too, could providing accessible charging and storage facilities, according to Amelia Neptune, who coordinates the League of American Bicyclist’s infrastructure evaluation program, Bike Friendly America.\n\n“It’s not just, do you have bike parking, but do you have bike parking that allows for storage of e-bikes and charging of e-bikes?” Neptune said. Some “bike pod” companies are offering a potential solution for those who don’t have garages at home to store their bikes. And some of the colleges and universities that work with Bike Friendly America are beginning to offer e-bike parking options in their dormitories.\n\nNone of this is to say that cities have to obliterate car infrastructure to install bike-friendly routes. The gold standard, Bigazzi said, is protected infrastructure for bikes, in which a lane is physically separated from vehicles. Intersections, too, ideally have “protective movements,” when bikes and cars move through at different times.\n\nNow cities face a choice: Invest in relatively cheap improvements to make cycling safer, thus encouraging people to cycle more, or double down on car infrastructure to accommodate EVs, thus encouraging people to drive more and endanger pedestrians and cyclists. “Cities can build out almost their whole bike network for the cost of rebuilding one or two freeway interchanges,” Bigazzi said. “So the cost of cycling infrastructure — even high-quality, protected infrastructure — is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities.”\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that EVs produce less brake dust than combustion vehicles.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Cities are deciding how to handle growing traffic and pollution. While electric cars are becoming more common, many places are also seeing a rise in electric bicycles, or e-bikes, which use a small motor to help riders pedal.\n\n**What happened** – In San Francisco, a coastal highway was closed to cars and turned into a park for people walking and biking. This shows a shift toward making cities friendlier for bikes. Across the U.S., cities are building bike lanes, lowering speed limits, and offering e-bike subsidies to encourage people to ride instead of drive.\n\n**Impact** – E-bikes help reduce carbon emissions by replacing many car trips. They also improve health because riders get more exercise, even though the motor helps on hills or longer rides. Studies show e-bike riders travel farther and more often than regular cyclists. Programs in places like New York, Denver, and British Columbia have cut car use and pollution while making travel easier for many people.\n\n**What's next step** – Cities need to keep improving bike lanes and make sure they are safe and well-maintained. Expanding subsidies and bike-share programs can help more people afford e-bikes. Educating drivers and riders about sharing the road is also important. These steps could make e-bikes a common way to get around, even in car-focused cities.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – E-bikes are becoming a practical, healthier, and greener alternative to cars, but cities must invest in safe bike-friendly infrastructure and support to unlock their full benefits.",

      "title": "'We're precipitating an extermination rather than an extinction event'",
      "summary": "Broadcaster and campaigner Chris Packham is on a mission to cut overconsumption, take on fossil fuel giants and create a fairer world",
      "content": "Becki Gill\n\nWildlife broadcaster Chris Packham’s kinship with the natural world began before he could even speak. As a young child in his parents’ small back garden in Southampton, UK, he became fascinated with tadpoles, snails and ladybirds. Soon his bedroom filled up with jam jars and tanks, and then the garden was crammed with enclosures. His obsessive interests expanded from moths and newts to include foxes and kestrels.\n\nPackham puts this intense curiosity down in part to being autistic. He says this shaped his keen ability to focus and find patterns – and his need to shelter from overwhelming social interactions. On and off screen, Packham isn’t afraid to speak his mind. He is a vocal supporter of environmental issues and animal rights, with campaigns aiming to put an end to game shooting and industrial farming. This has won him no shortage of enemies. In 2019, dead crows and a fox were left hanging on his gatepost, along with a death threat; a couple of years later a Land Rover was blown up outside his house.\n\nBut these attacks have only made Packham more resolute in trying to persuade other people that we already have the solution to save the natural world. New Scientist spoke to him about his latest campaign to end fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship in the UK, his upcoming TV series about evolution and how we can achieve a sustainable future on Earth.\n\nThomas Lewton: Whenever I watch the BBC’s Springwatch, it is clear you have a deep connection with the natural world. Does being autistic help you to form this connection?\n\nChris Packham: I think I was drawn to studying the natural world because of my ability to see things in great detail very rapidly and remember them. I have always found it easier to identify behaviours, or elucidate patterns of anatomy, physiology or whatever it happened to be. That curiosity about the natural world seemed to have been there almost inherently. My father was a marine engineer and my mother was a legal secretary, so the interest didn’t originate from them, but they certainly helped fuel it.\n\nWalking in the woods is one thing people can do that doesn’t require overconsumption Kevin Britland / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nI was an avid collector of living animals as a child. There were always things in jam jars and tanks in my bedroom. But when I got to about 12, my father bought me some binoculars. From that point onwards, I became less interested in keeping animals and more interested in watching them out in the wild.\n\nI had an obsessive interest in natural history, and it would ricochet from one species or group of species to another. I suppose we call it “focused interest” now, but I’ll stick with obsession. The more you can focus on a singular task or objective, the easier it is to exclude distractions. And then you tend to get to the bottom of what you’re trying to understand. That’s what excites your curiosity.\n\nThose are incredible abilities. Being neurodivergent can, of course, also be challenging. How would you encourage others who are autistic or who have other forms of neurodivergence to think about how they experience the world?\n\nIt’s about focusing on the opportunities and attributes that you might have rather than just the challenges and difficulties and embracing where that takes you. When I was a kid, I thought I was drawn to the woods by all those things that I wanted to see or catch at the time. But in reality, I was finding solace and respite there because I wasn’t being judged by my peers. I felt very comfortable there.\n\nI found I could totally immerse myself in the experience. Many people can identify a tree by its shape, or by its leaves, or by the pattern on its bark. But I can identify trees by the sound that rain makes on their leaves if I’m sitting underneath them with my eyes closed. That’s not a tremendous skill. Anyone could learn that. But that’s the sort of degree that I want to engage with nature.\n\nYou have dedicated much of your life to protecting nature. Why do you think you have faced a backlash to this activism?\n\nLike many other people, I’m asking a significant part of the population to change its mind and habits a bit more quickly than feels comfortable. Humans, as we know, are remarkable animals. We’re intelligent, adaptable, creative, imaginative, innovative. We’re brilliant in many ways – but we’re not very good at changing our minds.\n\nWe are burning through Earth’s natural resources Jim West / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nBut at this point it’s very clear that unless we do change our minds and therefore our practices, we’re going to be in even deeper trouble than we are already in. I try to [point out] that there are opportunities to deal with these problems. Let’s take them while there’s still a chance to do good and find positive outcomes. A section of society is reluctant to do that. And a tiny minority will push back in an aggressive and violent way.\n\nWhat keeps you going in the face of this violence?\n\nI genuinely don’t care. I’m a very determined person. I can’t be swayed from a course of action if I believe it’s the right course of action. I’ve never picked a fight because I thought I could win it. I’ve always picked my fights because I thought they were the right fights to pick at the time. Winning isn’t about crossing a line or getting a medal; winning is about not giving up.\n\nAt this point in time, that is the thing that you know people of my ilk – activists, campaigners, protesters – need to hold closest to their hearts. It’s very difficult at the moment. It’s very, very difficult.\n\nIn what way?\n\nWe’re being persecuted, you know, through an unjust legal system in terms of public protest in the UK. If we want to protest today we just don’t know where we stand. We don’t know if we will be arrested for wearing a T shirt, holding a placard or banner. We’re up against the terrible things which are happening in the US and other parts of the world when it comes to rolling back environmental protections, legislation and, indeed, environmental sciences.\n\nUltimately, though, I still think we are a wonderful species. We have the tools, technology and abilities at our disposal to make sure that we can adapt to the problems we’ve already generated. It’s just that we don’t have anyone out there with the gumption to roll them out broadly enough and rapidly enough to make a difference. So, I’ve got to help drive that.\n\nYou recently launched a petition to end fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship in the UK. Is this a major barrier to action on climate change?\n\nWell, in the UK, fossil fuel companies actually don’t spend too much money on advertising in the grand scheme of things, but they spend it in a very targeted way: they target decision-makers and politicians and others. People are being manipulated by mistruths.\n\nBut what we are increasingly seeing is billions of pounds being poured into sports sponsorship [by fossil fuel companies]. It subliminally ekes its way into people’s lives, and they see those companies as doing something advantageous. It’s normalising their business.\n\nProtesters fighting Shell’s sponsorship of British Cycling Andrea Domeniconi/Alamy Live News\n\nTheir business has no right to be normal any more. It’s destroying our planet. There’s no ambiguity about it. We need to stop them being able to greenwash their dirty linen in public through that sort of sponsorship.\n\nI mean, the idea that British Cycling is sponsored by Shell is like a bad joke. Cycling, something we do that is healthy, which combats carbon emissions. As is, I have to say, the continued acceptance of fossil sponsorship within some of our public institutions like the Science Museum and the British Museum, it shouldn’t be allowed.\n\nWhat does a sustainable future look like to you?\n\nIt’s very difficult, obviously, to look into a crystal ball, given advances in technology and now the very rapid advances that we see in climate breakdown. But what I think we need is a change in mindset. Firstly, everyone goes on about economic growth. But growth comes at the cost of consumption, and we live on a finite planet. So, quite clearly, we cannot continue to grow if we’re using all those resources in an unsustainable way.\n\n“ I’m asking a significant part of the population to change its mind and habits “\n\nPeople need to rethink what they want out of life. Does that consumption really make us happy? What are the rewards that we get out of life? Whether you’re into walking in the woods, whether you’re interested in art, singing, dance or whatever it happens to be that excites you in life, it doesn’t have to come at the cost of accumulating loads of stuff.\n\nWhat other shifts in mindset are needed? Do you think people should consider not having kids as part of achieving a sustainable population?\n\nWe have to be very careful when we’re talking about overpopulation. Obviously, the more people on the planet, the more consumption takes place. The question is, of course, who’s consuming it? And in many parts of the world, where populations are growing most rapidly, that isn’t where consumption is the greatest.\n\nIf everyone on Earth consumed resources at the same rate as people in the US, then we would need about five Earths to sustain this demand. We can only consume so much because of the resource poverty of other people in the world who are underusing the world’s available resources. I’m a very firm believer that when it comes to addressing climate breakdown, we must move towards a far greater degree of equality.\n\nOne of the most embarrassing things about the COP climate summit is that leaders fail to agree to significantly subsidise poorer countries in the world who are suffering most from climate breakdown. It’s that sort of pervasive greed which is the handicap.\n\nOn another note, you are finishing filming a BBC TV series about evolution, which is coming out next year. Evolution takes place over innumerable generations, billions of years. What can humans learn from that deep-time perspective about their place within nature?\n\nWell, firstly, how lucky we are to be here. Mutations happen unpredictably. And the fact that they occur in a place where they can actually succeed is quite odd. I mean, the chances of human life evolving are infinitesimally small. And very often evolution comes down to serendipity.\n\nSecondly, evolution gives us perspective on the damage humans are inflicting on the natural world now. We look at a number of mass extinction events in the series, and they aren’t always catastrophic. You know, a meteorite takes out all the dinosaurs, which was a disaster for the dinosaurs, but hey, we mammals had a great time in the aftermath. All of those niches that were previously unavailable, mammals evolved to fill them.\n\nSo, at the moment, we’re precipitating an extermination rather than an extinction event, since it’s us that’s driving it – and we need to get our language right. But whatever we do to the planet, life’s tenacity will mean that it will survive and, you know, it will be beautiful, maybe even more beautiful all over again.",
