      "content": "Engineers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have developed an artificial neuron whose electrical activity closely matches that of natural brain cells. The innovation builds on the team's earlier research using protein nanowires made from electricity-producing bacteria. This new approach could pave the way for computers that run with the efficiency of living systems and may even connect directly with biological tissue.\n\n\"Our brain processes an enormous amount of data,\" says Shuai Fu, a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering at UMass Amherst and lead author of the study published in Nature Communications. \"But its power usage is very, very low, especially compared to the amount of electricity it takes to run a Large Language Model, like ChatGPT.\"\n\nThe human body operates with remarkable electrical efficiency -- more than 100 times greater than that of a typical computer circuit. The brain alone contains billions of neurons, specialized cells that send and receive electrical signals throughout the body. Performing a task such as writing a story uses only about 20 watts of power in the human brain, whereas a large language model can require more than a megawatt to accomplish the same thing.\n\nEngineers have long sought to design artificial neurons for more energy-efficient computing, but reducing their voltage to match biological levels has been a major obstacle. \"Previous versions of artificial neurons used 10 times more voltage -- and 100 times more power -- than the one we have created,\" says Jun Yao, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at UMass Amherst and the paper's senior author. Because of this, earlier designs were far less efficient and couldn't connect directly with living neurons, which are sensitive to stronger electrical signals.\n\n\"Ours register only 0.1 volts, which about the same as the neurons in our bodies,\" says Yao.\n\nThere are a wide range of applications for Fu and Yao's new neuron, from redesigning computers along bio-inspired, and far more efficient principles, to electronic devices that could speak to our bodies directly.\n\n\"We currently have all kinds of wearable electronic sensing systems,\" says Yao, \"but they are comparatively clunky and inefficient. Every time they sense a signal from our body, they have to electrically amplify it so that a computer can analyze it. That intermediate step of amplification increases both power consumption and the circuit's complexity, but sensors built with our low-voltage neurons could do without any amplification at all.\"\n\nThe secret ingredient in the team's new low-powered neuron is a protein nanowire synthesized from the remarkable bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens, which also has the superpower of producing electricity. Yao, along with various colleagues, have used the bacteria's protein nanowires to design a whole host of extraordinary efficient devices: a biofilm, powered by sweat, that can power personal electronics; an \"electronic nose\" that can sniff out disease; and a device, which can be built of nearly anything, that can harvest electricity from thin air itself.\n\nThis research was supported by the Army Research Office, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.",

      "title": "We’re finally reading the secrets of Herculaneum’s lost library",
      "summary": "A whole library’s worth of papyri owned by Julius Caesar’s father-in-law were turned to charcoal by the eruption of Vesuvius. Nearly 2000 years later, we can at last read these lost treasures",
      "content": "A whole library’s worth of papyri owned by Julius Caesar’s father-in-law were turned to charcoal by the eruption of Vesuvius. Nearly 2000 years later, we can at last read these lost treasures\n\nJoe Wilson\n\nDeep within a particle accelerator, theoretical physicist Giorgio Angelotti is hard at work. He sets a black cylinder on a mount, bolts it down, then runs through some safety checks before retreating from the chamber, known as “the hatch”. “You have to be sure there’s no one in the hatch before you close the door,” he says. “So no one dies.”\n\nThat’s because he is about to blast the sample with a super-powerful beam of X-rays. You might expect the target to be some advanced new material or delicate crystal. But, at its heart, this isn’t really a physics experiment – and the object protected inside the cylinder is far from pristine. You could easily mistake it for a misshapen lump of old charcoal.\n\nIt is in fact a priceless relic, a 2000-year-old papyrus scroll, scorched beyond recognition in the cataclysmic eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79. It is just one of the Herculaneum papyri, a cache of hundreds of scrolls that are too fragile to be opened by hand, meaning their contents have long remained a mystery. But with the help of particle accelerators, artificial intelligence and a crack team of coders assembled online, Angelotti and his team are starting to make these charred lumps talk. They could soon be uncovering entire lost works of Greek philosophy, or texts written by the earliest Christians.\n\nDiscovered near Angelotti’s home city of Naples, Italy, in the 1750s, the scrolls come from the library of a partly excavated, 1st-century-BC villa in Herculaneum. The town, a smaller neighbour of Pompeii, was once a seaside holiday destination for rich Romans. The luxurious villa is thought to have been owned by Roman senator Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus – none other than Julius Caesar’s father-in-law.\n\nAt least some of the 900 scrolls originally discovered were authored by the philosopher Philodemus of Gadara, one of those credited with bringing Epicurean philosophy from Greece to Italy. Classicist David Blank at the University of California, Los Angeles, explains that Philodemus had joined Piso’s entourage, a cohort whose intellectual prowess publicly signalled the senator’s importance. In turn, Piso became a patron of Philodemus’s work, ensuring that a lot of his philosophical writings, including unique early drafts, ended up in Piso’s personal collection.\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThe Herculaneum papyri\n\nPiso and Philodemus had been dead for decades when Mount Vesuvius blew, but the library remained. As hot mud and ash engulfed Herculaneum, heat dehydrated the scrolls, not burning them, but turning them to charcoal. “The fact they are carbonised is the only reason we have them,” says papyrologist Federica Nicolardi at the University of Naples Federico II. Papyrus normally survives only in very dry climates. Other European examples rotted away centuries ago.\n\nThe Piso collection has since dwindled, however. The papyrus layers are tightly stuck together and early attempts to unwrap them resulted in a great many being mashed, sliced, peeled and otherwise processed in ways papyrologists would rather save for potatoes. Starting in the 1750s, the scrolls’ first curator, a man named Camillo Paderni, bashed out their insides to leave just the exterior layers. “He would take the roll, cut through it… then take the butt end of his knife and pound the middle of the roll into dust,” says Blank.\n\nThe Herculaneum papyri were turned to charcoal in the AD79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius. This one is known simply as “scroll 2” The Digital Restoration Initiative, The University of Kentucky\n\nA little later, Antonio Piaggio, a manuscript restorer from the Vatican Library, subjected some of the scrolls to a homemade machine. By mounting each scroll and sticking the end of the papyrus to a sheet of animal guts using glue made from fish, he was able to carefully unroll about 18 of them. These early abuses did yield several volumes’ worth of readable texts. This is how we know that at least some of the scrolls were authored by Philodemus. But most of the charcoal lumps languished unread in the National Library in Naples.\n\nAnd that was how things stood for centuries, until Brent Seales at the University of Kentucky entered the frame. Seales had lived through the early wave of digitisation, when the internet was becoming a repository for knowledge of all kinds. He wasn’t much interested in the mass scanning of ordinary books, but he became gripped by the notion that parts of this global library might be left out due to damage to the physical works. “The idea that technology could create a representation of, or even extract new information from, the damaged stuff – that really appealed to me,” he says.\n\nIn 2000, Seales used 3D scanning and computer software to digitally uncrumple and flatten pages from fire-damaged medieval documents amassed by Sir Robert Cotton, part of the founding collection of the British Library. Some books in the trove, however, were too fragile to be opened, so couldn’t be restored using standard imaging techniques, which are based on visible light. Seales began to wonder whether the same methods we use to see inside bodies could be used to see inside books.\n\nThe first time he fired X-rays at a book from the Cotton collection, the ink showed up much like bones do in the black and white images, he says. Immediately, he wanted to get his hands on other collections containing unopened texts, and his thoughts turned to the most famous example he knew of: the Dead Sea Scrolls. But when Seales described his plan to conservators, he was met with a “hell no”. Meanwhile, the Herculaneum scrolls entered his radar, courtesy of a tip-off from classicist Richard Janko at the University of Michigan, who had studied the contents of some of the physically opened scrolls.\n\nThese particular papyri, though, presented some special challenges. For one thing, unlike medieval writers, who used metallic inks, Philodemus and his contemporaries often wrote in soot-based ink. That meant the challenge was to discern an ink made mostly of carbon from a scroll that was also now mostly carbon. It wasn’t exactly easy. Sure enough, Seales failed to find any ink in initial attempts with a small CT scanner in 2009.\n\nHerculaneum was once a holiday destination for wealthy Roman citizens CCinar/Shutterstock\n\nMany Hebrew and Egyptian scribes used easier-to-image metallic inks. By 2015, Seales was able to read unseen text inside a charred 4th-century-AD Hebrew scroll. And not long after, a European team including Verena Lepper at Berlin’s Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection used X-ray-based scans to read the words “oh Lord” inside an ancient papyrus package from the island of Elephantine on the Nile river. But scans from inside the Herculaneum scrolls still hadn’t revealed a single word.\n\nThe digital unwrapping process wasn’t straightforward, either. The papyrus layers are so jammed together that it is tricky to peel them apart, even virtually. If the software doesn’t know the difference between one layer and the next, Nicolardi explains, “you produce something that’s actually very similar to what happens with the mechanically opened scrolls”. Pieces of text get spliced between layers, mangling the narrative.\n\nBy then, though, AI was on the rise and machines were starting to pick out features that human couldn’t. It turned out that scans of the Herculaneum papyri were, in fact, picking up ink, but it was visible only to properly configured AI. Seales and his colleagues finally demonstrated this on unrolled Herculaneum fragments and fake scrolls inscribed with carbon ink in 2019. That was enough to help secure them use of the particle accelerator at Diamond Light Source near Oxford, UK. He used it as a supercharged CT scanner and obtained images of the insides of rolled-up, intact papyri. But still the scrolls taunted them. Seales’s student Stephen Parsons taught AI software to spot ink on these high-resolution scans, but it struggled to see anything beyond mere traces.\n\nThat was when things changed decisively. Seales had connected with tech investor Nat Friedman, previously CEO of Github, hoping to pitch for more research funding. But Friedman had a different idea: put out a public challenge to see if anyone could write a program that could read the scrolls. Seales initially struggled with the proposal. This kind of cash-for-code challenge might be commonplace in the tech world, but for academic researchers it was unfamiliar territory – and it meant opening the scan data and Parsons’s algorithms to a wider community. “It wasn’t an obvious right move for me,” says Seales. “But we realised the only reason we were balking at the idea is that we might not get all the credit, and that was a really bad reason.”\n\nThe Vesuvius Challenge\n\nAnd so, in March 2023, the Vesuvius Challenge was born. Any prize-winning solutions would become public, the code released for the team or others to build on, in the hope that this would speed things up a bit. And so it proved: by Christmas, the challenge’s Discord channel had more than 1000 users.\n\nAngelotti was one of them. Fresh from a doctorate in AI, he had barely heard of the Herculaneum scrolls, despite being born and bred in Naples. But the more he learned about them, the more they intrigued him. Between consultancy work and founding an AI start-up, he poured over digitised papyrus sheets online. As he knew nothing about papyrology, it was a steep learning curve, but it turned out to be time well spent, resulting in cash prizes including $20,000 for work to speed up image processing – and a job offer. Now the research project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, Angelotti says reading the scrolls has become “a sort of quest to restore the cultural heritage of my homeland”.\n\nMeanwhile, students began to steal the limelight. In December 2023, ink-detection algorithms developed by Youssef Nader and Luke Farritor helped reveal around 2000 Greek characters. Nader taught AI to see ink by carefully training it on broken-off scroll fragments where the papyrus surface was already exposed. At the same time, Farritor was picking out the first word, porphyras (purple), from inside an unopened scroll by using a separate AI model trained on sections where a faint, but just visible, “crackle” pattern seemed to be associated with the inked parts.\n\nBy pooling their code and working with Julian Schilliger, a student at ETH Zürich in Switzerland who had been successfully stitching digital papyrus sheets together from pixels, they were able to get better results, not to mention a nod in a peer-reviewed papyrology paper. The translated text uncovered ancient musings on food, music and pleasure, in which the author seemed to ponder the timeless question of what makes life worth living.\n\nTheir efforts won them the Vesuvius Challenge’s $700,000 grand prize in 2023 – and, for Nader, a Mount Vesuvius cake (complete with scroll) baked by his family in Egypt. He, too, has since joined the challenge team, continuing to work on ink detection. This is far from a fully solved problem, because the ink varies from one scroll to another. In the long term, the team aims to build a fast, general ink-detection software that works for everything. “So that we can, at some point, just upload a scan of a scroll and download the text,” says Nader.\n\nStudents Youssef Nader, Luke Farritor and Julian Schilliger produced this prize-winning image of the text inside one of the scrolls Vesuvius Challenge\n\nThe unrolling problem hasn’t been completely solved yet, either. Initially, the inked surfaces of the papyrus layers were painstakingly mapped to flattened sections of digital papyrus by humans. But, with help from community members like Schilliger, the team is now increasingly able to get AI to do the task, which should yield faster results.\n\nCould solutions to these problems help researchers read other ancient papyri too? “I don’t think there’s one solution and there doesn’t need to be,” says Lepper, whose work on the Elephantine papyri used more traditional, non-AI software. Each collection has its quirks, she explains. Elephantine papyri, for example, aren’t charred, but many are folded instead of rolled, which can make unwrapping them more complex.\n\nRevealing hidden text in ancient manuscripts is no trivial task. But for the Vesuvius Challenge, at least, progress continues to accelerate “as a direct result of the contest”, says Seales, his initial reservations now seemingly forgotten. Both Seales and Angelotti are optimistic that there will come a time when it is as easy as pressing a button and letting the software do the rest. Right now, though, there are still plenty of scrolls left to scan, meaning more time spent kicking around in the control rooms of particle accelerators.\n\nWhen New Scientist spoke to Angelotti in mid-July, he had just finished scanning more than 30 Herculaneum scrolls at Diamond Light Source and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, the particle accelerator in Grenoble, France, with “the hatch”. He had also been carrying out crucial experimental work, the early results of which suggest that scanning at a higher resolution may help AI see features common to ink across all the scrolls. If so, the whole collection could become imminently readable. The only problem, Angelotti groans, is that it would mean the scans take about six times longer than usual – so more hours to kill in a control room.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vesuvius Challenge team has been preparing to release more data to its community of coders, and successes have continued to mount up. In May 2025, computer science graduates Marcel Roth and Micha Nowak at the University of Würzburg in Germany adapted medical-imaging software to read the first-ever title from within the scrolls, winning themselves $60,000. Roth says the pair got hooked on the contest, at one point skipping university for nearly three months.\n\nAnd the title? Philodemus, On Vices. “We were all very happy to see it was really Philodemus,” says Angelotti, because it confirmed the AI wasn’t hallucinating. It is unlikely to be the last we hear from Philodemus, either, because most of the scrolls read so far seem to come from the philosophy section of Piso’s vast library.\n\nBack in the Bay of Naples, there could be many more scrolls still to excavate. After all, part of the villa remains unexplored, obstructed by 20 metres of volcano spew and messy local politics. The New Testament puts Paul the Apostle on the scene around AD 50, before his execution about a decade and a half later. Could his movements have been recorded before Vesuvius’s eruption? Perhaps, “if the Herculaneum library had a current events section,” quips Seales. Until recently, of course, there wouldn’t have been much point in looking for such long-lost treasures, since we couldn’t unlock their contents. But now that we can, there’s a good argument for getting out the shovels.",

She asked the AI why it was so hard to create the image and it said it was because it didn't have enough data to work with. \"That was an important realisation for me that of course AI is a reflection of the world we live in today and the level of inequality and discrimination that exists,\" she says. Smith recently tried to generate the image again on ChatGPT and was amazed to find it could now produce an accurate picture of a woman with one arm, just like her. \"Oh my goodness, it worked, it's amazing it's finally been updated,\" she tells the BBC. \"This is a great step forward.\"\n\nJessica Smith Jess Smith found that ChatGPT was able to generate this image of her recently\n\nIt might not sound like a big deal, but for millions of people with disabilities, this shift matters. \"Representation in technology means being seen not as an afterthought, but as part of the world that's being built,\" Jess says. \"AI is evolving, and when it evolves with inclusion at its core, we all benefit. This is more than progress in tech it's progress in humanity.\" A spokesperson for OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, said it had recently \"made meaningful improvements\" to its image generation model. They added: \"We know challenges remain, particularly around fair representation, and we're actively working to improve this - including refining our post-training methods and adding more diverse examples to help reduce bias over time.\"\n\nNaomi Bowman AI edited Naomi's eye even though she didn't request for this to be done\n\nWhile Smith’s disability is now reflected with AI, Naomi Bowman, who only has sight in one eye, is still experiencing a similar problem. She asked ChatGPT to blur the background of a picture but instead it \"changed my face completely and evened out my eyes\". \"Even when I specifically explained that I had an eye condition and to leave my face alone; it couldn't compute,\" she says. Naomi initially found it funny but says \"it now makes me sad as it shows the inherent bias within AI\". She is calling for AI models to be \"trained and tested in rigorous ways to reduce AI bias and to ensure the data sets are broad enough so that everyone is represented and treated fairly\". Some concerned about AI‘s environmental impact have criticised the creation of images on ChatGPT. Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London told the BBC that ChatGPT is \"burning through energy\", and the data centres used to power it consume more electricity in a year than 117 countries.\n\nAwkward conversations\n\nExperts say bias in artificial intelligence often reflects the same blind spots that exist in wider society and it's not just disabilities that are unrepresented. Abran Maldonado, chief execuive of Create Labs, a US-based company that builds culturally aware AI system, says diversity in AI starts with who's involved in training and labelling the data. \"It's about who's in the room when the data is being built,\" he explains. \"You need cultural representation at the creation stage.\" Not everything is represented on the internet correctly and Maldonado adds that if you don't consult the people with lived experiences then AI will miss them. One well known example was a 2019 US government study which found that facial recognition algorithms were far less accurate at identifying African-American and Asian faces compared to Caucasian faces.\n\nDespite living with one arm, Jess doesn't see herself as disabled, saying the barriers she faces are societal. \"If I use a public toilet and the tap has to be held down, that impacts my ability, not because I can't do it, but because the designer hasn't thought about me.\" She believes there is a risk of the same oversight happening in the world of AI, systems and spaces built without considering everyone.",

However, these tools have struggled to accurately show people with disabilities, reflecting wider biases in society.\n\n**What happened** – Jess Smith, a former Australian Paralympic swimmer with one arm, tried to generate a picture of herself using ChatGPT. At first, the AI could not create an image showing her missing arm correctly. But recently, ChatGPT improved and was able to produce an accurate image of Jess, showing her as she really is.\n\n**Impact** – This change is important because it means AI is starting to include people with disabilities in its digital world. For many, being seen correctly by technology helps them feel recognized and valued. It also means AI is becoming less biased and more fair for everyone.\n\n**What's next step** – AI developers say they will continue to work on making their models more inclusive by adding diverse examples and improving training methods. However, some people with different disabilities, like Naomi Bowman who has sight in only one eye, still face challenges with AI representation. Experts believe involving diverse people in creating AI data is key to reducing bias.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – AI technology is beginning to better represent people with disabilities, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive digital tools.\n",
