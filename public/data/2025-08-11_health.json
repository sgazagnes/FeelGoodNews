      "title": "Scientists just found a tiny molecule that could change how we lose weight",
      "summary": "Researchers at the Salk Institute have used CRISPR to uncover hidden microproteins that control fat cell growth and lipid storage, identifying one confirmed target, Adipocyte-smORF-1183. This breakthrough could lead to more effective obesity treatments, surpassing the limitations of current drugs like GLP-1.",
      "content": "The obesity rate has more than doubled in the last 30 years, affecting more than one billion people worldwide. This prevalent condition is also linked to other metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and cancers. Current treatment options include lifestyle interventions, bariatric surgery, and GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic or Wegovy, but many patients struggle to access or complete these treatments or to maintain their weight loss afterwards.\n\nSalk Institute scientists are looking for a new treatment strategy in microproteins, an understudied class of molecules found throughout the body that play roles in both health and disease. In a new study, the researchers screened thousands of fat cell genes using CRISPR gene editing to find dozens of genes that likely code for microproteins -- one of which they confirmed -- that regulate either fat cell proliferation or lipid accumulation.\n\nThe findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on August 7, 2025, identify new microproteins that could potentially serve as drug targets to treat obesity and other metabolic disorders. The study also showcases the value of CRISPR screening in future microprotein discovery.\n\n\"CRISPR screening is extremely effective at finding important factors in obesity and metabolism that could become therapeutic targets,\" says senior author Alan Saghatelian, a professor and holder of the Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair at Salk. \"These new screening technologies are allowing us to reveal a whole new level of biological regulation driven by microproteins. The more we screen, the more disease-associated microproteins we find, and the more potential targets we have for future drug development.\"\n\nCurrent obesity and metabolic disorder therapeutics\n\nWhen our energy consumption exceeds our energy expenditure, fat cells can grow in both size and number. Fat cells store the excess energy in the form of fatty molecules called lipids. But while some excess storage is manageable, too much can cause fat deposits to accumulate around the body -- leading to whole-body inflammation and organ dysfunction.\n\nMany factors regulate this complex energy storage system. The problem is, how do we find them all, and how do we filter for factors that may make good therapeutic candidates?\n\nThis has been a longstanding question for Salk scientists. In fact, Salk Professor Ronald Evans has been working on it for decades. Evans is an expert on PPAR gamma, a key regulator of fat cell development and a potent target for treating diabetes. Several drugs have been developed to target PPAR gamma to treat obesity, but they resulted in side effects like weight gain and bone loss. An ideal PPAR gamma-based obesity therapeutic has yet to hit the market.\n\nWhen PPAR gamma drugs fell short, GLP-1 drugs entered the scene. GLP-1 is a peptide small enough to be considered a microprotein, and it serves as a blood sugar and appetite regulator. But, like PPAR gamma, GLP-1 drugs have their own shortcomings, such as muscle loss and nausea. Nonetheless, the popularity of GLP-1 drugs demonstrates a promising future for microprotein drugs in the obesity therapeutic space.\n\nSaghatelian's team is now searching for the next microprotein therapeutic with new genetic tools that bring microproteins out of the \"dark.\" For many years, long stretches of the genome have been considered \"junk\" and thus left unexplored. But recent technological advances have allowed scientists to look at these dark sections and find a hidden world of microproteins -- in turn, expanding protein libraries by 10 to 30 percent.\n\nIn particular, the Salk team is using innovative CRISPR screening to scour the \"dark\" for possible microproteins. This approach is enabling the simultaneous discovery of thousands of potential microproteins involved in lipid storage and fat cell biology, accelerating the search for the next PPAR gamma or GLP-1 drug.\n\nHow CRISPR screening accelerates the search for microproteins\n\nCRISPR screens work by cutting out genes of interest in cells and observing whether the cell thrives or dies without them. From these results, scientists can determine the importance and function of specific genes. In this case, the Salk team was interested in genes that may code for microproteins involved in fat cell differentiation or proliferation.\n\n\"We wanted to know if there was anything we had been missing in all these years of research into the body's metabolic processes,\" says first author Victor Pai, a postdoctoral researcher in Saghatelian's lab. \"And CRISPR allows us to pick out interesting and functional genes that specifically impact lipid accumulation and fat cell development.\"\n\nThis latest research follows up on a prior study from Saghatelian's lab. The previous study identified thousands of potential microproteins by analyzing microprotein-coding RNA strands derived from mouse fat tissues. These microprotein-coding RNA strands were filed away to await investigation into their functions.\n\nThe new study first expanded this collection to include additional microproteins identified from a pre-fat cell model. Notably, this new model captures the differentiation process from pre-fat cell to a fully mature fat cell. Next, the researchers screened the cell model with CRISPR to determine how many of these potential microproteins were involved in fat cell differentiation or proliferation.\n\n\"We're not the first to screen for microproteins with CRISPR,\" adds Pai, \"but we're the first to look for microproteins involved in fat cell proliferation. This is a huge step for metabolism and obesity research.\"\n\nMicroproteins of interest and next steps\n\nUsing their mouse model and CRISPR screening approach, the team identified microproteins that may be involved in fat cell biology. They then narrowed the pool even further with another experiment to create a shortlist of 38 potential microproteins involved in lipid droplet formation -- which indicates increasing fat storage -- during fat cell differentiation.\n\nAt this point, the shortlisted microproteins were all still \"potential\" microproteins. This is because the genetic screening finds genes that may code for microproteins, rather than finding the microproteins themselves. While this approach is a helpful workaround to finding microproteins that are otherwise so small they elude capture, it also means that the screened microproteins require further testing to confirm whether they are functional.\n\nAnd that's what the Salk team did next. They picked several of the shortlisted microproteins to test and were able to verify one. Pai hypothesizes this new microprotein, called Adipocyte-smORF-1183, influences lipid droplet formation in fat cells (also known as adipocytes).\n\nVerification of Adipocyte-smORF-1183 is an exciting step toward identifying more microproteins involved in lipid accumulation and fat cell regulation in obesity. It also verifies that CRISPR is an effective tool for finding microproteins involved in fat cell biology, obesity, and metabolism.\n\n\"That's the goal of research, right?\" says Saghatelian. \"You keep going. It's a constant process of improvement as we establish better technology and better workflows to enhance discovery and, eventually, therapeutic outcomes down the line.\"\n\nNext, the researchers will repeat the study with human fat cells. They also hope their success inspires others to use CRISPR screenings to continue bringing microproteins out from the dark -- like Adipocyte-smORF-1183, which until now, was considered an unimportant bit of \"junk\" DNA.\n\nFurther validation or screening of new cell libraries will expand the list of potential drug candidates, setting the stage for the new-and-improved obesity and metabolic disorder therapeutics of the future.\n\nOther authors include Hazel Shan, Cynthia Donaldson, Joan Vaughan, Eduardo V. De Souza, Carolyn O'Connor, and Michelle Liem of Salk; and Antonio Pinto and Jolene Diedrich of Scripps Research Institute.\n\nThe work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (F32 DK132927, RC2 DK129961, R01 DK106210, R01 GM102491, RF1 AG086547, NCI Cancer Center P30 014195, S10- OD023689, and S10-OD034268), Ferring Foundation, Clayton Foundation, and Larry and Carol Greenfield Technology Fund.",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIf you’ve ever stepped outside for a walk and returned feeling calmer, clearer, or more like yourself, you’re not imagining things. Nature has a real, measurable effect on your brain, and a growing field of research is revealing just how powerful that effect can be.\n\nMarc Berman, Ph.D., a psychology professor at the University of Chicago and founder of the Environmental Neuroscience Lab, is at the forefront of this research. In his book Nature and the Mind, he explores how our environments, especially natural ones, can enhance memory, focus, and emotional well-being. The takeaway? Whether you’re strolling along a beach, through a forest, or just past a city tree, even small doses of nature can make a big difference for your brain.\n\nWhat is environmental neuroscience?\n\nEnvironmental neuroscience is a term Berman coined to describe the intersection of brain science and the natural world. This area of study looks at how different environments shape mental functioning and particularly how nature can help the brain recover from mental fatigue.\n\nBerman’s early academic curiosity was shaped by his grandparents’ stories of surviving the Holocaust and a deep interest in how social environments influence human behavior. His work builds on psychologist Stephen Kaplan’s “Attention Restoration Theory,” which suggests that natural environments can gently engage the brain and allow it to recharge.\n\nWhy a walk in the park really works\n\nTo test Kaplan’s theory, Berman and his team conducted a study with a simple premise: Could a walk in nature improve cognitive performance?\n\nParticipants first completed a mentally draining task, then were asked to take a walk either through a quiet park or along a city street. When they returned and repeated the task, those who walked in nature improved their scores by about 20 percent. The group that walked in the urban setting did not show the same gains.\n\nWhat’s especially striking is that even participants who didn’t enjoy their nature walk (say, those walking through a bitter Chicago winter) still showed improved mental performance.\n\nHow nature restores attention\n\nTo understand why nature has this effect, it helps to look at the brain’s two types of attention: directed and involuntary.\n\nDirected attention is what you use to focus on tasks like work, reading, or studying. It’s mentally taxing and, like any resource, can get depleted over time. That’s why concentration tends to fade by late afternoon or after long periods of screen time.\n\nInvoluntary attention, on the other hand, is automatically captured by subtle, pleasant stimuli. Think of the sound of birds, the sight of rustling trees, or the rhythm of ocean waves. These natural elements create what scientists call soft fascination, a kind of effortless engagement that gently holds your focus while allowing your directed attention to rest and recover.\n\nMore than just mental clarity\n\nThe benefits of nature go beyond improving attention and memory. Berman’s research has linked green spaces to a range of mental and physical health outcomes:\n\nBetter mood and cognitive gains in depression: In one study, people with clinical depression experienced even greater cognitive improvements after a walk in nature than healthy participants. “We thought ruminating in nature might worsen symptoms, but we found the opposite,” Berman noted.\n\nIn one study, people with clinical depression experienced even greater cognitive improvements after a walk in nature than healthy participants. “We thought ruminating in nature might worsen symptoms, but we found the opposite,” Berman noted. Faster healing: Hospital patients recovering from surgery who had views of trees required less pain medication and were discharged sooner compared to those with window views of a wall.\n\nHospital patients recovering from surgery who had views of trees required less pain medication and were discharged sooner compared to those with window views of a wall. Improved academic performance: Children living near or attending schools surrounded by more greenery performed better on attention and memory tests even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors.\n\nChildren living near or attending schools surrounded by more greenery performed better on attention and memory tests even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. Lower crime and aggression: In Chicago public housing, residents with a modest view of trees or grass showed reduced aggression and lived in buildings with less reported crime.\n\nEven tiny changes made a noticeable difference. In Toronto, Berman’s team found that adding just one average-sized tree per city block improved self-reported health as much as moving to a neighborhood with a ten-thousand-dollar higher median income.\n\nEasy ways to add more nature to your routine\n\nGood news: You don’t need to relocate to a forest cabin to benefit from nature. Berman recommends these accessible strategies:\n\nAim for two hours of nature per week (or about 20 minutes a day). This is the “minimum effective dose” to see cognitive and emotional benefits.\n\n(or about 20 minutes a day). This is the “minimum effective dose” to see cognitive and emotional benefits. Take breaks when your attention is fading. Mid-afternoon or after intense screen time are great moments for a short nature reset.\n\nMid-afternoon or after intense screen time are great moments for a short nature reset. Simulate nature if needed. Looking at photos of natural scenes or listening to nature sounds for just ten minutes can offer similar (though slightly reduced) effects.\n\nLooking at photos of natural scenes or listening to nature sounds for just ten minutes can offer similar (though slightly reduced) effects.

Don’t wait for sunshine. Rain or snow won’t cancel out the benefits. Nature exposure is helpful in all kinds of weather.\n\nNature is more than a luxury—it’s a necessity\n\nBerman’s work drives home a powerful point: Nature isn’t just a pleasant backdrop. It’s essential for mental, emotional, and even physical health. From sharper focus to faster healing, better mood to improved community outcomes, natural environments have the ability to quietly transform how we think, feel, and function.\n\n“A lot of people still think of nature as an amenity,” Berman says. “But it’s a necessity.”",

It was not until she was over 40 years old that Sunniva Kwapeng was diagnosed with lipoedema.\n\nHowever, before a correct diagnosis was made, she tried all sorts of diets -- with little success.\n\nA recent NTNU study shows that her experience is quite typical. It is unlikely that the body fat associated with lipoedema can be lost through dieting.\n\nLimited knowledge\n\n\"Despite this being a disease that affects many women, little is known about it, which is rather thought-provoking,\" said Julianne Lundanes, a former PhD candidate at NTNU.\n\nLipoedema is a poorly understood disease that primarily affects women.\n\nThe disease is characterized by disproportionate and excess fatty tissue on the thighs and calves, and sometimes on the arms, while the hands and feet remain unaffected.\n\nLundanes recently submitted her doctoral thesis at NTNU on the relationship between two different diets and their effects on pain, quality of life, body weight and composition, appetite and inflammation.\n\nSome people also become obese\n\nLipoedema is painful. It can be painful to move, and it is easy for people with the disease to get caught up in a vicious cycle of inactivity and reduced quality of life. Lipoedema is often mistaken for obesity, but they are two distinct conditions.\n\nIf a person with lipoedema loses weight, it is common to see normal fat disappear, such as on the stomach, while the calves and thighs remain the same size. When a person is obese, fat can be stored all over the body, both under the skin and around the internal organs.\n\nIn lipoedema, the accumulation of fatty tissue occurs mainly under the skin on the hips, thighs, calves and arms.\n\nThe pain associated with the disease can have a significant impact on quality of life, making movement difficult.\n\n\"We don't know why the disease is so painful. We believe it involves an inflammatory condition in the fat, and that this is what causes the pain,\" said Lundanes.\n\nLipoedema is often hereditary\n\nThere are currently no Norwegian national guidelines for the treatment or follow-up of women with lipoedema.\n\n\"We also don't know much about why some women develop lipoedema, except that it appears to be hereditary. It is often the case that several people in the same family are affected by it. The disease often manifests during hormonal changes such as puberty, pregnancy and menopause,\" Lundanes said.\n\nThe aim of Lundanes's study was to determine whether a low-carbohydrate diet could serve as an alternative form of treatment for patients with the disease.\n\nShe had a sample of 70 women with lipoedema aged 19-73 years old, which was divided into two groups.\n\nOne group followed a low-carb diet, while the other followed a low-fat diet. Both groups ate the same number of calories each day, but the amount of carbohydrates and fat varied.\n\nThe participants received weekly follow-up for eight weeks and were tested at the beginning and end of the study. Pain and quality of life were measured through a questionnaire.\n\nThe results showed clear differences between the two groups.\n\nSimilar degrees of inflammation\n\n\"The women in the low-carb group had less pain. The participants in the other group did not experience any change in pain, but both groups reported better quality of life,\" said Lundanes.\n\nTests were also carried out to see if the reduction in pain was due to the low-carb diet leading to less inflammation in the body. This turned out not to be the case.\n\n\"There was no difference in changes in inflammation between the two groups. We also measured inflammation through blood tests, so inflammation in the fatty tissue itself still needs to be investigated in order to draw any conclusions,\" Lundanes said.\n\nGreater weight loss on the low-carb diet\n\nThe women who followed the low-carb diet lost more weight than those who followed the low-fat diet.\n\n\"At the end of the study, we found that the women who ate fewer carbohydrates were less hungry than the other group. The feeling of being less hungry is a well-known benefit of low-carb diets once ketosis is achieved. This may have helped these women lose more weight than the other group,\" Lundanes said.\n\nThere is no treatment that can eliminate the causes of or cure lipoedema. There's only treatment that can alleviate some of the symptoms.\n\nLiposuction is one option, but it is currently only offered as part of a research study at Haraldsplass Hospital in Bergen. The only other alternative is to pay for private surgery, and that can cost hundreds of thousands of Norwegian kroner.\n\n\"The long-term effects of lipoedema liposuction have still not been fully investigated. There is a lack of research in this area too,\" Lundanes said.\n\nCompression reduces pain\n\nMost people currently receive help in the form of physical therapy and compression garments that squeeze and support the fatty tissue.\n\n\"Compression garments give many people relief,\" says Lundanes.\n\nFor Kwapeng, compression garments have been a great help in managing the pain.\n\n\"I've also lost many centimeters on my legs because of the compression garments. My expenses for compression are covered, but in other parts of the country, they're not. It's completely random what kind of help you get,\" says Kwapeng.\n\nAt home, she has a machine that's also used by patients with other conditions. The machine is called a pulsator and is a vacuum treatment for the lymphatic vessels designed to activate the lymphatic system. Lymphatic drainage initiates several cleansing processes in the body and can help improve blood circulation.\n\nThe machine is like a giant pair of pants used while lying down.\n\n\"It works really well for me. It takes away the pain. I also get more energy. If I have low energy and lie down in it, it's like my body wakes up,\" says Kwapeng.\n\nOver time, she has learned to live with the disease.\n\n\"It's frustrating to have a condition that is so poorly understood. A doctor once told me that at least I won't die from having lipoedema -- but I die a little every time I can't sit on the floor with my daughter. I die a little every time I can't go on a hike I want to take because of the pain. And I die a little every time people think I'm just fat and lazy,\" Kwapeng said.",

      "personality_title": "Low-carb diet eases pain and aids weight loss for women with lipoedema",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Lipoedema is a painful condition that mainly affects women, causing an unusual buildup of fat in the legs and arms while sparing the hands and feet. It is often misunderstood and confused with obesity. Many women with lipoedema experience pain and difficulty moving, but treatment options are limited and not well developed.\n\n**What happened** – Sunniva Kwapeng, who was diagnosed with lipoedema in her 40s after years of pain and unsuccessful dieting, participated in a study at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The study involved 70 women with lipoedema divided into two groups: one following a low-carbohydrate diet and the other a low-fat diet, both with the same calorie intake. After eight weeks, the low-carb group experienced less pain and lost more weight than the low-fat group.\n\n**Impact** – This study is important because it shows for the first time that diet can influence pain levels in lipoedema, even though the exact reason is still unclear. Notably, the reduction in pain was not linked to changes in inflammation measured in the blood, suggesting other factors may be involved. The low-carb diet also helped reduce hunger, making it easier for participants to lose weight. Since lipoedema fat is usually resistant to weight loss, these findings offer a promising new approach for managing symptoms.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers need to explore why the low-carb diet reduces pain and how inflammation in the fatty tissue itself might be involved. More studies will be necessary to confirm these results and to develop clear treatment guidelines. Meanwhile, patients like Sunniva continue to use compression garments and lymphatic treatments to manage symptoms, while medical research looks for more effective solutions.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A low-carbohydrate diet has been shown to reduce pain and support weight loss in women with lipoedema, offering a new tool to improve their quality of life.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Le lipœdème est une maladie douloureuse qui touche principalement les femmes, provoquant une accumulation anormale de graisse sur les jambes et les bras, tout en épargnant les mains et les pieds. Cette maladie est souvent mal comprise et confondue avec l’obésité. De nombreuses femmes atteintes souffrent de douleurs et ont du mal à bouger, mais les options de traitement sont limitées.\n\n**Ce qui s'est passé** – Sunniva Kwapeng, diagnostiquée dans la quarantaine après des années de douleurs et d’échecs avec différents régimes, a participé à une étude de l’Université norvégienne des sciences et de la technologie (NTNU). L’étude a regroupé 70 femmes atteintes de lipœdème, divisées en deux groupes : un suivant un régime pauvre en glucides et l’autre un régime pauvre en graisses, avec un apport calorique identique. Après huit semaines, le groupe pauvre en glucides a ressenti moins de douleur et perdu plus de poids.\n\n**Impact** – Cette étude est importante car elle montre pour la première fois que le régime alimentaire peut influencer la douleur liée au lipœdème, même si la cause exacte reste inconnue. La baisse de douleur n’était pas liée à une diminution de l’inflammation mesurée dans le sang, ce qui suggère d’autres mécanismes. Le régime pauvre en glucides a aussi réduit la sensation de faim, facilitant la perte de poids. Étant donné que la graisse du lipœdème est généralement difficile à perdre, ces résultats ouvrent une nouvelle piste prometteuse.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs doivent comprendre pourquoi ce régime réduit la douleur et étudier l’inflammation directement dans les tissus graisseux. D’autres études seront nécessaires pour confirmer ces résultats et établir des directives claires. En attendant, des patientes comme Sunniva continuent d’utiliser des bas de contention et des traitements lymphatiques pour gérer les symptômes, tandis que la recherche médicale progresse.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Un régime pauvre en glucides réduit la douleur et aide à la perte de poids chez les femmes avec lipœdème, offrant une nouvelle façon d’améliorer leur qualité de vie.\n",
      "personality_title_es": "Una dieta baja en carbohidratos alivia el dolor y ayuda a perder peso en mujeres con lipedema",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – El lipedema es una enfermedad dolorosa que afecta principalmente a mujeres, causando una acumulación desproporcionada de grasa en las piernas y brazos, mientras que las manos y pies quedan sin afectar. A menudo se confunde con la obesidad y provoca dolor y dificultad para moverse. Las opciones de tratamiento actuales son limitadas y poco desarrolladas.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Sunniva Kwapeng, diagnosticada con lipedema en sus cuarenta años tras años de dolor y dietas sin éxito, participó en un estudio de la Universidad Noruega de Ciencia y Tecnología (NTNU). El estudio incluyó a 70 mujeres con lipedema divididas en dos grupos: uno con una dieta baja en carbohidratos y otro con una dieta baja en grasas, ambas con la misma ingesta calórica. Después de ocho semanas, el grupo de baja en carbohidratos reportó menos dolor y mayor pérdida de peso.\n\n**Impacto** – Este estudio es relevante porque muestra, por primera vez, que la dieta puede afectar el dolor en el lipedema, aunque la causa específica aún no se conoce. La reducción del dolor no estuvo vinculada a cambios en la inflamación en la sangre, lo que sugiere otros factores en juego. Además, la dieta baja en carbohidratos ayudó a disminuir el hambre, facilitando la pérdida de peso. Dado que la grasa del lipedema es difícil de perder, estos hallazgos ofrecen una nueva opción para manejar los síntomas.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores deben estudiar por qué la dieta baja en carbohidratos reduce el dolor y examinar la inflamación en el tejido graso. Se necesitan más estudios para confirmar estos resultados y crear guías claras de tratamiento. Mientras tanto, pacientes como Sunniva continúan usando prendas de compresión y tratamientos linfáticos para aliviar los síntomas, mientras avanza la investigación médica.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Una dieta baja en carbohidratos reduce el dolor y ayuda a perder peso en mujeres con lipedema, ofreciendo una nueva forma de mejorar su calidad de vida.\n",

      "title": "How much damage are ultraprocessed foods really doing to your health?",
      "summary": "Many foods we consume today are ultraprocessed, packed with unhealthy ingredients, and linked to major health risks. As consumption of these foods rises, so do chronic health issues, especially among lower-income groups. Experts are calling for clearer guidelines, better research, and systemic changes to reduce the impact of ultraprocessed foods on public health.",
      "content": "Science Advisory Highlights:\n\nMost ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) are characterized by poor nutritional quality, contributing to excessive calories, and are typically high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium (salt), the combination of which is often abbreviated as HFSS, which contribute to adverse cardiometabolic health outcomes, including heart attack, stroke, obesity, inflammation, Type 2 diabetes and vascular complications.\n\nObservational studies have found links between eating higher amounts of UPFs and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic illness and mortality.\n\nEmerging evidence also suggests certain additives and industrial processing techniques may have negative health effects.\n\nHowever, not all UPFs are junk foods or have poor nutritional quality; some UPFs have better nutritional value and can be part of an overall healthy dietary pattern.\n\nExperts recommend multilevel strategies, including more research to uncover how UPFs specifically impact the body, refining dietary guidance to discourage excessive consumption of nutrient-poor UPFs, clarifying the impact of the limited number of UPFs with more favorable nutrition profiles, more research on the health impacts of food additives and evidence-based policies to evaluate and regulate food additives.\n\nUltraprocessed foods or UPFs are a growing concern due to their widespread consumption and impact on potential health risks. Most UPFs, particularly those commonly seen in U.S. dietary patterns, are high in saturated fat, added sugars and sodium (salt), the combination of which is often abbreviated as HFSS, and contribute to excess calories. These include sugar-sweetened drinks, ultraprocessed meats, refined grains, candy and commercial baked goods, among others. A limited number of ultraprocessed foods, such as certain commercial whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and some plant-based items, have positive nutritional value and, therefore, can be part of an overall healthy dietary pattern. This overlap is confusing for health care professionals and the public.\n\nA new Science Advisory from the American Heart Association, \"Ultraprocessed Foods and Their Association with Cardiometabolic Health: Evidence, Gaps and Opportunities,\" summarizes current knowledge about UPFs and their impact on cardiometabolic health, and outlines opportunities for research, policy and regulatory reform to improve dietary intake and overall health. The manuscript published on August 8 in Circulation, the flagship journal of the American Heart Association.\n\n\"The relationship between UPFs and health is complex and multifaceted,\" said Maya K. Vadiveloo, Ph.D., R.D., FAHA, volunteer chair of the writing group for this Science Advisory. \"We know that eating foods with too much saturated fat, added sugars and salt is unhealthy. What we don't know is if certain ingredients or processing techniques make a food unhealthy above and beyond their poor nutritional composition. And if certain additives and processing steps used to make healthier food like commercial whole grain breads have any health impact.\"\n\nThe rapid rise in UPF consumption since the 1990s disrupted traditional dietary patterns, potentially contributing to adverse health effects. It is estimated that 70% of grocery store products in the U.S. contain at least one ultraprocessed ingredient. As detailed in a CDC report published on August 7, 55% of calories consumed by people ages 1 and older in the U.S. were UPFs. Among youth ages 1-18 years of age, total UPF calories jumped to nearly 62%, and among adults ages 19 and older total UPF calories was 53%. In addition, families with lower mean income had a higher percentage of UPFs consumed per day: 54.7% for the lowest income group vs. 50.4% for highest income group.[1]\n\nUPFs are relatively inexpensive, convenient for use and aggressively marketed, particularly toward youth and under-resourced communities, often displacing healthier alternatives. This shift resulted in lowering the overall nutritional quality of typical eating patterns in the U.S. and is misaligned with the American Heart Association's dietary guidance.\n\nThis new Science Advisory reinforces current dietary guidelines from the American Heart Association to:\n\nReduce the intake of most UPFs, especially those high in saturated fat, added sugars and sodium, and those that contribute to excessive calories; and\n\nReplace UPF consumption with healthier options like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds and lean proteins.\n\nHow are ultraprocessed foods classified?\n\nUPFs are multi-ingredient foods containing additives (likely intended to enhance shelf life, appearance, flavor or texture) widely used in industrial food production and not commonly used in home cooking. Human diets are increasingly including more industrially processed foods, leading to various systems for classifying foods based on processing criteria. Multiple food classification systems exist currently; this Science Advisory focuses on the Nova framework for food classification. The Nova system, the most widely used, is based on the nature, extent and purpose of the food's industrial food processing. However, the Nova categorization does not consider the nutritional quality of foods. Certain types of industrial food processing are beneficial for preservation and safety, and/or lowering cost, such as techniques that extend shelf life, control microbial growth, mitigate chemical toxicants, preserve functional, nutritional and sensory (taste) qualities, and reduce food loss and waste.\n\nEfforts to understand UPFs are hindered by differing definitions, limitations in dietary assessment tools and food composition databases, which often lack detailed information on additives and processing methods. Currently, U.S. manufacturers are not required to disclose processing techniques or cosmetic additive quantities, which contributes to the variability in risk estimates and confusion for consumers.\n\nThe writing group cautions that an overreliance on the degree of processing as a proxy for healthfulness of foods could sway the food industry to reduce or remove the markers of ultraprocessing from foods that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium and promote them as \"better-for-you alternatives.\"\n\nHealth Impact of UPFs\n\nA meta-analysis of prospective studies cited in the advisory found a dose-response relationship between UPF consumption and cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, transient ischemic attack and stroke, Type 2 diabetes, obesity and all-cause mortality. High versus low UPF intake was linked to a 25%-58% higher risk of cardiometabolic outcomes and a 21%-66% higher risk of mortality. More research is needed to understand the appropriate thresholds for daily consumption of UPFs -- what a safe amount is and the incremental risks of eating more UPFs.\n\nResearch has also found that there may be underlying mechanisms that affect eating behaviors and obesity for some people, and that UPFs may promote obesity. UPFs frequently contain combinations of ingredients and additives that are uncommon in whole foods to enhance palatability and reduce cost, and these may influence reward-related brain activity. For example, ingredients like artificial flavors may mimic sweetness without sugar, and this disruption in flavor-nutrient relationships often leads to irregular eating habits, and results in weight gain.\n\nOpportunities for research and policy\n\nBalancing multiple priorities, including the practical need for a nutrient-dense, affordable food supply, current evidence supports the following key research and policy changes to improve public health and reduce risks related to UPFs:\n\nIntroduce approaches for individuals, food manufacturers and the retail industry that help shift eating patterns away from UPFs high in saturated fat, added sugars and sodium toward patterns high in vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, nontropical liquid plant oils, fish and seafood, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and, if personally desired, lean poultry and meats. Enact multipronged policy and systems-change strategies (e.g., front-of-package labels) to help reduce intake of HFSS products. Increase research funding to explore critical questions about UPFs: To what extent is it the ultraprocessing itself that makes a UPF unhealthy vs. the fact that ultraprocessed foods tend to have unhealthy ingredients? Most UPFs overlap with HFSS foods that are already targeted for cardiometabolic risk reduction, so a better understanding of the root causes of UPFs' link to poor health is fundamental to effective reduction strategies. Enhance ongoing efforts to improve food additive science, including streamlined and efficient evaluation and regulation of food additives.\n\n\"More research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of how UPFs impact health. In the meantime, the Association continues to urge people to cut back on the most harmful UPFs that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium, and excessive calories and instead follow a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds and whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and lean proteins like fish, seafood or poultry -- for better short- and long-term health,\" said Vadiveloo.\n\nThis Science Advisory was prepared by the volunteer writing group on behalf of the American Heart Association Council on Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health; the Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; the Council on Clinical Cardiology; the Council on Genomic and Precision Medicine; and the Stroke Council.
