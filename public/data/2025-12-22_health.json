      "title": "A new tool is revealing the invisible networks inside cancer",
      "summary": "Spanish researchers have created a powerful new open-source tool that helps uncover the hidden genetic networks driving cancer. Called RNACOREX, the software can analyze thousands of molecular interactions at once, revealing how genes communicate inside tumors and how those signals relate to patient survival. Tested across 13 different cancer types using international data, the tool matches the predictive power of advanced AI systems—while offering something rare in modern analytics: clear, interpretable explanations that help scientists understand why tumors behave the way they do.",
      "content": "Researchers at the University of Navarra in Spain have created RNACOREX, an open-source software platform designed to identify gene regulation networks linked to cancer survival. The tool was developed by scientists at the Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DATAI), in collaboration with members of the Cancer Center Clínica Universidad de Navarra. Its performance has been tested using data from thirteen different tumor types provided by the international consortium The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\n\nRNACOREX was published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology. It can analyze thousands of biological molecules at the same time, allowing it to detect important molecular interactions that are often missed by traditional analysis methods. By producing a clear and interpretable molecular \"map,\" the software helps researchers better understand how tumors function and offers new ways to explore the biological processes that drive cancer progression.\n\nDecoding Cancer's Hidden Genetic Structure\n\nWithin human cells, different types of molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNA (mRNA) -- communicate through highly complex regulatory networks. When these networks fail to function properly, diseases including cancer can develop.\n\n\"Understanding the architecture of these networks is crucial for detecting, studying, and classifying different tumor types. However, reliably identifying these networks is a challenge due to the vast amount of available data, the presence of many false signals, and the lack of accessible and precise tools capable of distinguishing which molecular interactions are truly associated with each disease,\" says Rubén Armañanzas, head of the Digital Medicine Laboratory at DATAI and one of the study's lead authors.\n\nRNACOREX was designed to overcome these challenges. It integrates curated information from international biological databases with real-world gene expression data to rank the most biologically meaningful miRNA-mRNA interactions. From this foundation, the software builds progressively more complex regulatory networks that can also function as probabilistic models for studying disease behavior.\n\nPredicting Survival With Interpretable Results\n\nTo evaluate how well the tool performs, the research team applied RNACOREX to data from thirteen different cancers, including breast, colon, lung, stomach, melanoma, and head and neck tumors, using information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\n\n\"The software predicted patient survival with accuracy on par with sophisticated AI models, but with something many of those systems lack: clear, interpretable explanations of the molecular interactions behind the results,\" says Aitor Oviedo-Madrid, a researcher at the Digital Medicine Laboratory of DATAI and first author of the study.\n\nBeyond survival prediction, RNACOREX can identify regulatory networks linked to clinical outcomes, detect molecular patterns shared across multiple tumor types, and spotlight individual molecules with strong biomedical relevance. These insights may help researchers generate new hypotheses about how tumors grow and progress, while also pointing toward promising future diagnostic markers or treatment targets. \"Our tool provides a reliable molecular 'map' that helps prioritize new biological targets, speeding up cancer research,\" Oviedo-Madrid adds.\n\nAn Expanding Open-Source Platform\n\nRNACOREX is freely available as an open-source program on GitHub and PyPI (Python Package Index). It includes automated tools for downloading databases, making it easier for laboratories and research institutions to integrate the software into their workflows. The project has received partial funding from the Government of Navarra (ANDIA 2021 program) and the ERA PerMed JTC2022 PORTRAIT.\n\n\"As artificial intelligence in genomics accelerates, RNACOREX positions itself as an explainable, easy-to-interpret solution and an alternative to 'black-box' models, helping bring omics data into biomedical practice,\" says Armañanzas.\n\nThe University of Navarra team is already working on expanding the software's capabilities. Planned additions include pathway analysis and new layers of molecular interaction data, with the goal of creating models that more fully explain the biological mechanisms behind tumor growth and progression. These efforts highlight the institution's broader commitment to interdisciplinary research that combines biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and data science to advance personalized and precision cancer medicine.\n\n",

      "title": "Is a vegan diet safe for kids? A huge study has answers",
      "summary": "A major new meta-analysis finds that vegetarian and vegan diets can support healthy growth in children when properly planned. Kids on plant-based diets often had better heart health markers, including lower “bad” cholesterol, and consumed more fiber and vitamins. But the study also flagged common nutrient gaps—especially vitamin B12 and calcium—without supplementation. Experts say plant-based eating is achievable for kids, but only with careful planning.",
      "content": "Carefully planned vegetarian and vegan diets can support healthy growth in children when appropriate supplements are included, according to a major new meta-analysis, the most comprehensive review to date of plant-based diets in young people.\n\nResearchers from Italy, USA and Australia examined health, growth, and nutritional outcomes in more than 48,000 children and adolescents around the world who followed different eating patterns. Their findings show that vegetarian and vegan diets can provide many important nutrients and support normal development. At the same time, the analysis highlights a higher risk of nutrient shortfalls when key nutrients are not supplied through fortified foods or supplements.\n\nThe peer-reviewed research, published in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, also indicates that plant-based diets may offer added health advantages for children. These include improved markers of cardiovascular health when compared with omnivorous diets that include meat, fish, and other animal-derived foods.\n\nInside the Largest Analysis of Its Kind\n\nThis large meta-analysis reviewed data from 59 studies conducted across 18 countries, making it the most extensive evaluation so far of plant-based diets in children under 18 years of age. The researchers compared lacto-ovo-vegetarian (which include dairy products and eggs, but exclude meat, fish and poultry) and vegan diets (which exclude all animal-derived foods) with omnivorous diets across a broad range of nutritional and health measures.\n\nThe analysis included 7,280 lacto-ovo-vegetarians, 1,289 vegans, and 40,059 omnivores, allowing researchers to assess differences in nutrient intake, growth, and overall health.\n\nVegetarian children were found to consume higher amounts of fiber, iron, folate, vitamin C, and magnesium than omnivorous children. However, they also had lower intakes of energy, protein, fat, vitamin B12, and zinc. Although fewer studies focused specifically on vegan children, similar nutritional patterns were observed.\n\nKey Nutrient Gaps to Watch\n\n\"Notably, vitamin B12 didn't reach adequate levels without supplementation or fortified foods, and calcium, iodine and zinc intakes were often at the lower end of recommended ranges, making them important nutrients to consider for children on plant-based diets,\" explains the study co-author Dr. Jeannette Beasley, an Associate Professor in the Departments of Nutrition and Food Studies and Medicine at New York University.\n\n\"Vegan children, in particular, had especially low calcium intake.\"\n\nHealth Benefits and Body Composition\n\nDespite concerns around nutrient intake, both vegetarian and vegan children showed more favorable cardiovascular health profiles than omnivores. In particular, they had lower levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as the \"unhealthy\" form of cholesterol.\n\nMeasurements of growth and body composition revealed that children following plant-based diets tended to be leaner. Vegetarian children were slightly shorter and lighter on average, with lower body mass index (BMI), fat mass, and bone mineral content. Vegan children also had shorter stature and lower BMI scores compared with omnivores.\n\n\"Our analysis of current evidence suggests that well-planned and appropriately supplemented vegetarian and vegan diets can meet nutritional requirements and support healthy growth in children,\" states lead-author Dr. Monica Dinu, who focuses on exploring how nutrition shapes health and well-being at the Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, at the University of Florence, in Italy.\n\nGuidance for Parents Considering Plant Based Diets\n\nPlant based diets remain a viable option for children and can offer both health and environmental benefits. The researchers emphasize that families should not be discouraged from choosing vegetarian or vegan diets for ethical, environmental, or health reasons.\n\nInstead, they advise parents to plan these diets carefully and, when possible, seek guidance from clinicians such as dietitians and paediatric health professionals. Paying attention to a small number of key nutrients can help ensure children's nutritional needs are met during critical periods of growth while minimizing potential risks.\n\n\"We hope these findings offer clearer guidance on both the benefits and potential risks of plant-based diets, helping the growing number of parents choosing these diets for health, ethical or environmental reasons,\" Dr. Dinu adds.\n\nWhy More Research Is Still Needed\n\nThe authors also highlight the importance of developing clear, evidence-based recommendations to help families plan healthy plant-based diets for children, especially during stages of rapid growth and development when nutritional demands are higher.\n\nAt the same time, the researchers caution that the findings have limitations. Many of the studies included were cross-sectional, methods and populations varied widely, and accurately measuring children's dietary intake remains challenging.\n\n\"In conclusion,\" says fellow co-author Dr. Wolfgang Marx, from the Food & Mood Centre, at Deakin University, Australia, \"while well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets are nutritionally adequate and beneficial for adults, there is far less clarity about their suitability for children -- leading to inconsistent or even conflicting advice for parents.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that a balanced approach is essential, with families paying close attention to certain nutrients -- particularly vitamin B12, calcium, iodine, iron and zinc -- to ensure their children get everything they need to thrive.\"",
