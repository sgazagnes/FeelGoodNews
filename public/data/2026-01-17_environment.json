      "summary": "A United Nations agreement for the “conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity” in the open oceans has now taken effect",
      "content": "A United Nations agreement for the “conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity” in the open oceans has now taken effect\n\nA trawler in the Southern Ocean Shutterstock\n\nA treaty that will protect areas of the largely lawless high seas from fishing has come into force, marking a “turning point” for ocean conservation.\n\nInternational waters outside the exclusive economic zones that stretch 370 kilometres from countries’ coasts are sometimes known as a “wild west” where there are few limits on fishing. They have also been called the “last wilderness” because their huge depths represent 95 per cent of habitat occupied by life, most of it unexplored.\n\nIn September 2025, a United Nations agreement for the “conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity” in the open oceans – which cover half of the Earth’s surface – was ratified by more than 60 countries. That started a 120-day countdown until it took effect.\n\n“It’s one of the important environmental agreements ever,” says Matt Frost at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK. “There was no mechanism to establish marine protected areas in the high seas.”\n\nThe treaty is a “turning point” in the defence of the “blue heart of Earth that regulates climate and sustains life,” says world-renowned marine biologist Sylvia Earle at the conservation organisation Mission Blue.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nIt will be almost a year before countries can actually establish protected areas under the treaty, since its rules and oversight structures must be agreed at an inaugural conference of the parties expected in late 2026.\n\n“This moment shows that cooperation at a global scale is possible,” Earle says. “Now we must act on it.”\n\nIn the Atlantic Ocean conservationists are hoping to protect, among other places, the seaweed mats of the Sargasso Sea, birthplace of all American and European eels, and the “Lost City” of towering hydrothermal vent chimneys that house extremophile microorganisms and fish. In the Pacific Ocean, targets include the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges, underwater mountain chains that are home to whales, sharks, turtles and swordfish.\n\nThe treaty will also create a repository to share genetic resources discovered in international waters, such as species that could lead to development of new medicines.\n\nAs maritime technology has evolved from individual fishing boats to factory ship fleets that process hundreds of tonnes of fish a day, commercial fishing has ventured further into the high seas, threatening biodiversity hotspots. Bottom trawling has torn up the seabed. Now companies are developing ways to fish new species in the mesopelagic “twilight zone” 200 to 1000 metres below sea level.\n\nRegional fisheries management organisations have failed to prevent the over-exploitation of 56 per cent of targeted fish stocks in the high seas, so for two decades countries have been pushing for a treaty to rein in this damage.\n\nOne argument in favour of action is that 90 per cent of marine protected areas in national waters boosted neighbouring fisheries by giving fish a place to spawn and grow.\n\nAnother motivator was the 30 by 30 initiative to conserve 30 per cent of the Earth’s surface by 2030, a goal that’s impossible without setting aside swathes of the high seas.\n\nProtecting areas from fishing and the plastic pollution that comes with it will help marine life build resilience to rising temperatures, as the ocean has absorbed 90 per cent of excess heat from global warming.\n\n“If you’re sick with three things at a time, if you remove two of them you’re free to fight the other one,” Frost says.\n\nOcean ecosystems also absorb a quarter of climate-warming CO2. Seagrass meadows and kelp forests store carbon, and processes like the mass migration of mesopelagic fish and plankton that feed at the surface by night and hide in the depths by day draw more of the gas from the atmosphere.\n\n“They’re shuttling carbon from the surface waters down into the deep, and that carbon is then sort of out of harm’s way,” says Callum Roberts at the Convex Seascape Survey, a 5-year, global research project focused on the ocean’s role in tackling climate change.\n\nThe treaty’s first challenge will be choosing the right areas to protect, especially as species shift their ranges in response to warming seas. Only 27 per cent of the ocean floor has been fully mapped.\n\nEnforcement will also be difficult. Of the marine protected areas currently recognised in national waters, at least a quarter are likely “paper parks” doing little to defend species.\n\nSatellite imagery and artificial intelligence now allow researchers to track almost all vessels and identify illegal activities. But even if ships are caught violating high seas protected areas, it will be up to member states to deny them port access or pressure the countries they hail from.\n\nWhile the treaty has been signed by 145 nations, it’s only binding on those that ratify it. So far 83 have, but not the UK, US, Canada or Australia.\n\n“The more countries that ratify it, the more powerful this treaty gets,” says Sarah Bedolfe at the conservation group Oceana. “It’s the responsibility of all of us to protect [the high seas], and it’s also all of us who get to benefit.”",

      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nNorway has hit the brakes on its controversial plans to mine the deep ocean floor, announcing it will not issue any deep-sea mining licenses until at least 2029. The decision, confirmed in early December 2025, marks a significant shift in momentum for the fledgling industry and offers breathing room for environmental advocates who have long warned of the irreversible risks posed to marine ecosystems.\n\nPrime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre emphasized that this is a postponement, not a permanent ban, but for many critics of the practice, the delay is being hailed as a victory nonetheless.\n\nPolitical negotiations lead to a legislative slowdown\n\nThe halt came as part of a broader budget negotiation between the ruling Labour Party and a coalition of left-leaning parties, including the Socialist Left, the Greens, the Reds, and the Centre Party. While Labour leads the government, it lacks a parliamentary majority and needs coalition support to pass its 2026 budget.\n\nThe political compromise now ensures that no licenses for deep-sea mining will be issued during the current legislative term, which ends in 2029. As a result, the controversial industry’s ambitions in Norway have been put on ice for the next four years.\n\nNorway’s original deep-sea mining ambitions\n\nNorway made headlines in 2024 when it became the first country in the world to approve deep-sea mining within its own national waters, with the goal of tapping mineral-rich nodules needed for clean energy technologies like solar panels and electric vehicle batteries.\n\nThe government had designated a vast area of around 280,000 square kilometers between Svalbard, Greenland, and Iceland for potential exploration. Mining licenses were originally expected to be issued as early as 2025.\n\nSupporters of the move framed it as a bold step toward a “green transition,” reducing reliance on oil and gas by supplying critical minerals for renewable energy and digital infrastructure. But critics argued that the ecological risks were too high, and that the push for seabed mining was built on shaky environmental and economic justifications.\n\nEnvironmental warnings get louder\n\nScientists and advocacy groups have repeatedly cautioned that deep-sea mining could cause permanent damage to fragile ocean ecosystems and disturb one of the planet’s largest carbon stores. While proponents claim the practice can be done sustainably, the science remains far from settled.\n\n“We know so little about the deep ocean, but we know enough to be sure that mining it will wipe out unique wildlife, disturb the world’s largest carbon store, and do nothing to speed the transition to clean economies,” said Steve Trent, CEO and founder of the Environmental Justice Foundation.\n\nA 2024 report by the foundation concluded that seabed mining is not necessary to achieve clean energy targets. Instead, a mix of recycling, circular economy strategies, and improved technology could reduce the need for new mineral extraction by 58 percent between 2022 and 2050.\n\nEnvironmentalists call for permanent protection\n\nThe temporary freeze has reignited calls for Norway to support a global moratorium on deep-sea mining and to take a more active role in marine conservation.\n\n“This must be the nail in the coffin for the deep-sea mining industry in Norway,” said Haldis Tjeldflaat Helle of Greenpeace Nordic, adding that “any government that is committed to sustainable ocean management cannot support deep-sea mining.”\n\nHelle also urged the Norwegian government to “step up and become a real ocean leader” by formally protecting Arctic deep-sea ecosystems from industrial extraction.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAlthough the pause provides a temporary safeguard, Norway’s official stance leaves the door open to future development. Prime Minister Støre noted that the Socialist Left Party, one of the key players behind the budget deal, “does not hold power forever.”\n\nThat said, for now, no mining activity will take place during the current parliamentary session, and with growing scrutiny from scientists, environmentalists, and even some industry leaders, the pathway to commercial deep-sea mining remains uncertain.\n\nAs the world heads into 2026 with increasing urgency around climate action and biodiversity loss, Norway’s pause offers a moment of reflection and perhaps a test case for how resource-hungry nations balance environmental stewardship with technological ambition.\n\nDid this solution stand out?

      "content": "January 10, 2026\n\nAt about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of New Zealand’s South Island, the sparsely populated Chatham Islands are rugged, remote, and often inconspicuous. In January 2026, however, a ring of bright green and blue swirls in the ocean put a natural spotlight on the far-flung specks of land.\n\nA bloom of phytoplankton—tiny photosynthetic organisms that become visible to satellites when their numbers explode—encircled the Chatham Islands in austral summer. Surface currents and eddies carried the floating organisms into intricate wisps and swirls. The VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) on the NOAA-20 satellite captured this image of the display on January 10, 2026.\n\nThe Chatham Islands sit on the Chatham Rise, an underwater plateau that extends eastward from the South Island of New Zealand. The top of the rise is relatively shallow and separates areas of deeper water to the north and south. These seafloor contours make blooms common along the Chatham Rise, where cold, nutrient-rich currents from the Antarctic and warm, nutrient-poor water from the subtropics converge. The well-mixed water, coupled with long daylight hours, can boost phytoplankton populations.\n\nWith phytoplankton at the base of the food web, the waters around the Chatham Islands support productive fisheries, with valuable species such as pāua, rock lobster, and blue cod. The region is also home to an array of marine mammals, including five seal species and 25 whale and dolphin species. Amid this abundance, however, the islands are a hotspot for whale and dolphin strandings, in which hundreds of animals are sometimes beached.\n\nNASA Earth Observatory image by Lauren Dauphin, using VIIRS data from NASA EOSDIS LANCE, GIBS/Worldview, and the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS).

      "personality_title": "Bright phytoplankton bloom lights up waters around the Chatham Islands",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The Chatham Islands lie about 800 kilometers east of New Zealand’s South Island. These islands are remote and have few people living there. The surrounding ocean is shaped by underwater features and different water currents that meet in this area.\n\n**What happened** – In January 2026, a large bloom of phytoplankton, tiny ocean plants, spread around the Chatham Islands. These plants grew so much that satellites could see their bright green and blue swirls in the water. The bloom was carried by ocean currents into beautiful patterns visible from space.\n\n**Impact** – Phytoplankton are very important because they form the base of the ocean’s food chain. The bloom shows the waters around the islands are rich in nutrients and healthy. This supports many fish species like pāua, rock lobster, and blue cod, and also helps marine mammals such as seals, whales, and dolphins live there.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will continue to watch these blooms with satellites to learn more about how ocean conditions change and support life. This information can help manage fisheries and protect marine animals.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A bright phytoplankton bloom around the Chatham Islands signals a thriving ocean ecosystem that supports diverse sea life and important fisheries.",
      "personality_title_fr": "Une floraison brillante de phytoplancton illumine les eaux autour des îles Chatham",
      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les îles Chatham se trouvent à environ 800 kilomètres à l’est de l’île du Sud de la Nouvelle-Zélande. Ces îles sont isolées et peu peuplées. L’océan autour est influencé par des reliefs sous-marins et différentes courants d’eau qui se rencontrent dans cette région.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – En janvier 2026, une grande floraison de phytoplancton, de minuscules plantes marines, s’est étendue autour des îles Chatham. Ces plantes ont tellement poussé que les satellites ont pu voir leurs tourbillons verts et bleus dans l’eau. La floraison a été transportée par les courants marins en motifs visibles depuis l’espace.\n\n**Impact** – Le phytoplancton est très important car il forme la base de la chaîne alimentaire marine. Cette floraison montre que les eaux autour des îles sont riches en nutriments et en bonne santé. Cela soutient de nombreuses espèces de poissons comme le pāua, la langouste et le cabillaud bleu, et aide aussi les mammifères marins tels que les phoques, les baleines et les dauphins.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques continueront de surveiller ces floraisons avec des satellites pour mieux comprendre comment les conditions océaniques changent et soutiennent la vie. Ces informations pourront aider à gérer les pêcheries et protéger les animaux marins.\n\n**Phrase à retenir** – Une brillante floraison de phytoplancton autour des îles Chatham montre un écosystème marin en pleine santé qui soutient une vie marine diverse et des pêcheries importantes.",
      "personality_title_es": "Un brillante floración de fitoplancton ilumina las aguas alrededor de las Islas Chatham",
      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Las Islas Chatham están a unos 800 kilómetros al este de la Isla Sur de Nueva Zelanda. Estas islas son remotas y tienen poca población. El océano alrededor está influenciado por relieves submarinos y diferentes corrientes que se encuentran en esta zona.\n\n**Qué pasó** – En enero de 2026, una gran floración de fitoplancton, pequeñas plantas marinas, se extendió alrededor de las Islas Chatham. Estas plantas crecieron tanto que los satélites pudieron ver sus remolinos verdes y azules en el agua. La floración fue llevada por las corrientes marinas en patrones visibles desde el espacio.\n\n**Impacto** – El fitoplancton es muy importante porque forma la base de la cadena alimenticia del océano. La floración muestra que las aguas alrededor de las islas son ricas en nutrientes y están saludables. Esto ayuda a muchas especies de peces como pāua, langosta de roca y bacalao azul, y también apoya a mamíferos marinos como focas, ballenas y delfines.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos seguirán observando estas floraciones con satélites para aprender más sobre cómo cambian las condiciones oceánicas y apoyan la vida. Esta información puede ayudar a manejar las pesquerías y proteger a los animales marinos.\n\n**Frase para recordar** – Una brillante floración de fitoplancton alrededor de las Islas Chatham indica un ecosistema marino saludable que sostiene una vida marina diversa y pesquerías importantes.",
