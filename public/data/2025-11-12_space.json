      "title": "Astronomers just solved the mystery of “impossible” black holes",
      "summary": "New simulations suggest magnetic fields hold the key to forming black holes that defy known mass limits. When powerful magnetic forces act on a collapsing, spinning star, they eject vast amounts of material, creating smaller yet faster-spinning black holes. This process could explain the puzzling GW231123 collision and the existence of “forbidden” black holes.",
      "content": "An extensive series of computer simulations led by astrophysicists at the Flatiron Institute and their collaborators has revealed that magnetic fields are the missing factor behind the creation of black holes whose masses fall within a range once thought impossible.\n\nIn 2023, astronomers witnessed a dramatic event: two extraordinarily massive black holes collided roughly 7 billion light-years away. Their immense size and rapid spin defied explanation. According to existing theories, black holes like these simply shouldn't exist.\n\nResearchers from the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) and partner institutions have now uncovered how such cosmic giants might form and eventually collide. By tracing the life cycles of the stars that gave rise to these black holes, the team discovered that magnetic fields -- long overlooked in earlier models -- play a crucial role.\n\n\"No one has considered these systems the way we did; previously, astronomers just took a shortcut and neglected the magnetic fields,\" explains Ore Gottlieb, an astrophysicist at the CCA and lead author of the study, which appears in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"But once you consider magnetic fields, you can actually explain the origins of this unique event.\"\n\nThe 2023 Collision That Challenged Black Hole Theory\n\nThe cosmic crash, now known as GW231123, was detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observatories, which measure gravitational waves -- the ripples in space-time produced by massive celestial motions.\n\nAt the time of detection, astronomers could not understand how such enormous and fast-spinning black holes had formed. When a massive star exhausts its fuel, it typically collapses and explodes in a supernova, leaving behind a smaller black hole. However, stars within a specific mass range experience an especially violent type of explosion called a pair-instability supernova, which destroys the star completely.\n\n\"As a result of these supernovae, we don't expect black holes to form between roughly 70 to 140 times the mass of the sun,\" Gottlieb says. \"So it was puzzling to see black holes with masses inside this gap.\"\n\nSimulations Reveal a Hidden Force at Work\n\nOne possible explanation is that black holes within this \"mass gap\" form indirectly, through the merger of smaller black holes. But in the case of GW231123, this seemed unlikely. Mergers are typically chaotic, disrupting the spin of the resulting black hole. Yet the two black holes involved in GW231123 were spinning near the speed of light -- the fastest ever observed -- making such a scenario improbable.\n\nTo solve the mystery, Gottlieb and his team performed a two-stage simulation. First, they modeled a massive star 250 times the mass of the Sun through its life and death. By the time it exploded as a supernova, it had burned enough fuel to shrink to about 150 solar masses -- just above the theoretical mass gap, leaving behind a black hole.\n\nThe next phase introduced magnetic fields into the picture. The model began with the remnants of the supernova: a swirling cloud of stellar debris containing magnetic fields and a newborn black hole at the center. Earlier theories assumed all the remaining material would fall into the black hole, but the new simulations painted a different picture.\n\nHow Magnetism Reshapes the Fate of a Collapsing Star\n\nIf a collapsing star is not rotating, the surrounding matter falls straight into the black hole. But when a star spins rapidly, that material forms a disk around the black hole, feeding it over time and increasing its spin. Magnetic fields, however, disrupt this process. Their pressure can blast some of the material outward at nearly the speed of light, preventing it from falling in.\n\nThis ejection of matter reduces the amount of material the black hole absorbs. The stronger the magnetic fields, the more mass gets expelled. In extreme cases, up to half of the original star's mass can be lost to these outflows. In the team's simulations, this mechanism naturally produced a black hole whose mass fell within the once \"forbidden\" range.\n\n\"We found the presence of rotation and magnetic fields may fundamentally change the post-collapse evolution of the star, making black hole mass potentially significantly lower than the total mass of the collapsing star,\" Gottlieb says.\n\nLinking Black Hole Mass and Spin\n\nThe results point to an intriguing relationship between a black hole's mass and how quickly it spins. Stronger magnetic fields can slow a black hole's rotation and remove more stellar mass, leading to smaller, slower black holes. Weaker fields, on the other hand, allow heavier, faster-spinning ones to form. This pattern could reveal a broader law connecting mass and spin -- a relationship that future observations might confirm.\n\nCurrently, no other known black hole systems can test this connection, but astronomers hope upcoming detections will uncover more examples like GW231123.\n\nBursts of Light From the Darkest Events\n\nThe simulations also predict that these magnetic processes produce bursts of gamma rays during black hole formation. Detecting such gamma-ray flashes could help confirm the theory and show how common these massive black holes really are.\n\nIf verified, these findings would not only explain an \"impossible\" collision but also reshape how scientists understand one of the universe's most extreme and fascinating objects.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – In 2023, astronomers observed a rare event where two massive black holes collided far away in space. These black holes were bigger and spun faster than scientists thought possible, creating a puzzle because existing theories said such black holes shouldn’t exist.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at the Flatiron Institute used computer simulations to study how these black holes formed. They included magnetic fields in their models, which previous studies had ignored. They found that magnetic forces can push away a lot of the star’s material as it collapses, making smaller but faster-spinning black holes.

      "content": "Eight possible cave openings found on the Martian surface look to have once had ancient streams flowing into them, suggesting they are promising places to look for evidence of life\n\nChannels, pits and caves in the Hebrus Valles on Mars may have been carved by ancient flowing water NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor\n\nCaves carved by water that once flowed beneath Mars’s surface could have been ideal for life to thrive, if it once existed on the Red Planet, and they might still preserve traces of it today.\n\nMars is dotted with holes that look like cave entrances, but these are usually near regions that are suspected to have been volcanically active, which suggests they formed due to processes like underground lava flows, rather than the passage of water.\n\nOn Earth, there are thousands of caves formed when water dissoves soluble rock, known as karstic caves. But scientists have yet to find signs of such caves on Mars, despite evidence that the planet was covered in water billions of years ago.\n\nNow, Chunyu Ding at Shenzhen University in China and his colleagues say they have identified eight possible caves that look to have been produced by ancient water flows, rather than volcanic activity. The caves are in the Hebrus Valles, a north-western region containing hundreds of kilometres of valleys and depressions that seem to have been carved out by ancient floods.\n\nThese caves have been mapped by previous Mars missions, such as NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor, which orbited Mars from 1997 to 2006. Ding and his team used spectrometry data from that mission to analyse the material around the cave entrances. This shows they are high in carbonate and sulphate minerals, which typically form in the presence of water.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Launchpad Bring the galaxy to your inbox every month, with the latest space news, launches and astronomical occurrences from New Scientist’s Leah Crane. Sign up to newsletter\n\nThey also found evidence of ancient streams that end near the cave entrances. This is similar to what we see near karstic caves on Earth, says James Baldini at Durham University in the UK. “If you’re looking on a map, you would expect the stream to be on a surface, and then all of a sudden disappear, because the stream water is being pirated by the cave system.”\n\nDaniel Le Corre at the University of Kent, UK, says the mineralogical and geological evidence suggests these could be water caves, but there is nothing about their appearance that looks strikingly different from other caves on Mars. “I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time looking at the Mars global cave catalogue, and these do look very similar to ones that are known to be volcanic in origin,” he says.\n\nIf these are water caves, they could be particularly good places to look for life. “In order to have life, you need water and an environment that is sheltered from the intense radioactive bombardment on the surface of Mars,” says Baldini. “Volcanic caves and lava tubes are also reasonable places to look for life, but there’s not necessarily any water involved.”\n\nMartian water caves might also contain stalagmites, the bulbous, protruding columns of rock that are common in karstic caves on Earth, which could act as time capsules for aspects of Mars’s ancient environment, such as its temperature.\n\nBut stalagmites can take many thousands of years of constant water flow to form, and even if we manage to send a rover or drone into the caves to sample them, working out when exactly the stalagmites were formed could be extremely difficult, says Baldini.\n\nJournal reference: The Astrophysical Journal Letters DOI: 10.3847/2041-8213/ae0f1c",
