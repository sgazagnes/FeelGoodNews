      "summary": "OBSERVER: Commission participates in Danish Space Conference highlighting the EU’s growing ambitions in space\nsonia\nFri, 24/10/2025 - 15:56\n\nUnder the Danish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the 2025 Space Conference in Aalborg brought together policymakers, researchers, entrepreneurs, and students to discuss Europe’s priorities in space, defence, and innovation. The European Commission contributed across the programme, from the opening plenary to exchanges with university students and joint discussions with ESA and EUSPA on cooperation in space programmes. In this Observer, we look at some highlights from the conference.\n \nThe Space Conference 2025, held at Musikkens Hus in Aalborg from 20 to 21 October, was organised by Aalborg University and the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Science under the Danish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The event brought together policymakers, industry representatives, researchers, and students to discuss how space supports Europe’s economy, innovation, and security. Over two days of plenary and thematic sessions, participants explored Europe’s strategic ambitions in space and the practical steps needed to strengthen competitiveness and resilience. \n \nSetting the stage\nEU Commissioner for Defence and Space Andrius Kubilius opened the conference with a keynote which linked Europe’s space ambitions to defence readiness and industrial competitiveness. He recalled the Commission’s proposals made earlier in the year: a Vision for the European Space Economy with forty actions, an EU Space Act to create a single market for space services, and a proposed fivefold increase in the next multiannual budget for defence and space to 131 billion euros. He placed these within the roadmap on defence readiness presented in Brussels the previous week, arguing that space capabilities are essential for Europe’s security. “Without space, there will be no defence readiness,” he said, emphasising the link between space infrastructure and Europe’s defence ambitions.\nLooking ahead, he announced the European Commission’s plan to formally launch the European Space Shield next summer, which will be developed with Member States and will build on national capacities and on flagship components of the EU Space Programme: Galileo, Copernicus, and IRIS². He set out near-term service milestones, noting that GOVSATCOM is expected to start operating before the end of this year, that the Commission is accelerating work with industrial partners on IRIS², and that a Low Earth Orbit positioning, navigation and timing concept is in development to complement Galileo’s existing services, alongside the declaration of operational availability of the encrypted Public Regulated Service (PRS) later this year. He also outlined plans for an Earth Observation Governmental Service (EOGS) for geo-intelligence, with user requirements to be consolidated by November, security requirements early next year, and an operational deployment from 2028 in the next EU budgetary cycle, subject to agreement with Member States.\nThe Commissioner underlined the need for stronger space situational and domain awareness and in-space operations such as repair or refuelling of satellites. He closed his keynote with a call to guarantee European autonomous access to space, highlighting the ramp-up of Ariane 6 and Vega C and the importance of more frequent launches, and moving towards reusable systems so Europe can fully benefit from what he called a coming space revolution.\n\n\nEU Commissioner for Defence and Space Andrius Kubilius opened the conference with a keynote which linked Europe’s space ambitions to defence readiness and industrial competitiveness. Credit: European Union.\n\n \nPolicy dialogue and European cooperation\nThe keynote was followed by a moderated discussion with Christina Egelund, Denmark’s Minister for Higher Education and Science, and Joachim Finkielman, Director of the DI Defence and Security Industries association, introduced by opening remarks from Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former Prime Minister of Denmark and former NATO Secretary General. Rasmussen sketched three immediate challenges for Europe in space: low launcher competitiveness, private mega-constellations consuming scarce orbital resources, and an investment gap compared with the United States, before urging faster European action and clearer common standards. \nThe panel then turned to what a practical European response looks like. Commissioner Andrius Kubilius underlined the goal of the EU Space Act to cut fragmentation and set simple “rules of the road” in increasingly crowded orbits, while pointing to the need for market scale so companies can operate across borders. Egelund argued for sustained public commitment to unlock private capital, and for Danish efforts to strengthen the national ecosystem while staying anchored in a European framework. Finkielman called for clearer political ambition and fewer barriers for industry, noting the urgency of converting research into deployable solutions. The exchange highlighted a shared conviction that Europe’s competitiveness in space will depend on strong policy direction, investment in skills, and the capacity to turn innovation into operational advantage.\nLater, a session on European collaboration in space programmes brought together representatives of the European Commission, ESA, and EUSPA. Christophe Morand (European Commission), Laurent Jaffart (ESA), and Rodrigo da Costa (EUSPA) discussed how cooperation among the three supports the EU’s flagship services in navigation, Earth Observation, and secure connectivity. The discussion focused on maintaining continuity of operations while preparing for the next generation of systems, including IRIS² and the future evolution of Copernicus and Galileo. They emphasised that coordination between the European Commission, ESA, and EUSPA remains central to ensuring reliability, user uptake, and resilience across the EU Space Programme.\n\n\nPanel discussion with EU Commissioner for Defence and Space Andrius Kubilius, Christina Egelund, Denmark’s Minister for Higher Education and Science, and Joachim Finkielman, Director of the DI Defence and Security Industries association. Credit: European Union.\n\n \nEngaging with students\nA highlight of the conference was an interactive dialogue between Commissioner Andrius Kubilius and more than a hundred university students as part of the EU Youth Policy Dialogues. The discussion centred on regulation and innovation, strategic autonomy, and the defence dimension of space. Opening the exchange, the Commissioner reflected on his background in physics and how science drives progress, before turning to the rapid evolution of the space sector. He spoke of the exponential rise in the number of satellites in orbit and the need for Europe to keep pace with global competitors. “If you ask Ukrainians how important Starlink is, you will hear a lot about that,” he said, adding that Europe must not lag behind. The IRIS² programme, he continued, will deliver a secure satellite-communication system “better than Starlink”, developed jointly with Member States and European industry.\nStudents asked how Europe can remain competitive while avoiding excessive regulation. On the forthcoming EU Space Act, the Commissioner said its purpose is to simplify the patchwork of national rules: “Now we have thirteen or fourteen different space acts made by different Member States. If you register yourself, for example, in Denmark, you will be registered all over Europe.” The Act, he explained, would establish “rules of the road” for increasingly crowded orbits.\nQuestions on entrepreneurship and innovation prompted discussion on Europe’s start-up culture. The Commissioner called for stronger venture capital and greater willingness to take risks, citing CASSINI as a key instrument supporting the new-space ecosystem, while noting the need for broader financial reform so European savings and pension funds invest more in domestic innovation.\nHe also addressed space security, referring to the Russian anti-satellite test before the invasion of Ukraine as a warning and stressing the need for rapid-launch capability to place satellites in orbit in crisis situations, as part of the effort to “defend our space systems” while using space to support defence. Concluding the session, he urged students to stay curious and adaptable in a field advancing faster than ever. “Space,” he said, “is something like a new frontier for human civilisation.”\n\n\nEU Commissioner for Defence and Space Andrius Kubilius, Christina Egelund, Denmark’s Minister for Higher Education and Science, and ESA astronaut Andreas Mogens engaged in a dialogue with students. Credit: European Union.\n\n\n \nInnovation, SMEs, and data in practice\nThe second day of the conference showcased how European initiatives are translating innovation into market opportunities. Sessions on Earth Observation and artificial intelligence featured contributions from ECMWF and EUSPA, highlighting how Copernicus data and EU-funded research under Horizon Europe are advancing climate and environmental applications.\nFiammetta Diani, Head of Market, Downstream and Innovation at EUSPA, presented the CASSINI initiative, describing it as “Europe’s umbrella for space entrepreneurship.” She outlined how CASSINI brings together funding instruments, competitions, and acceleration activities to help start-ups move from early-stage ideas to commercial success. One notable outcome of CASSINI has been the significant financial support for Danish companies, which secured nearly €50 million through challenges, competitions, and matchmaking opportunities, and several of them attended the conference to share their experiences and successes. Diani underlined the importance of connecting national and regional innovation clusters, such as Space Connect North, so that “ideas can scale beyond national borders.”\nOn secure connectivity, speakers examined progress on IRIS² and its links to industrial participation. Discussions also touched on dual-use needs and how these intersect with research, procurement, and the wider supply chain, reflecting Europe’s drive to align innovation with resilience and strategic autonomy. \n\n\nFiammetta Diani, Head of Market, Downstream and Innovation at EUSPA, presented the CASSINI initiative, describing it as “Europe’s umbrella for space entrepreneurship”. Credit: European Union.\n\n\n \nAn exhibition of EU space achievements\nAlongside the sessions, an EU exhibition at Musikkens Hus introduced visitors to the components of the EU Space Programme. Inside, displays highlighted recent milestones such as the first images from the Copernicus Sentinel-4 satellite, as well as upcoming launches, including those of the Galileo L14 and Sentinel-1D satellites. The exhibition combined striking visual design with physical satellite models and interactive installations, giving visitors a close-up view of Europe’s space technology and its growing role in everyday life.\nOutside the venue, a Copernicus Earth Art installation illustrated how the EU’s Earth Observation system supports monitoring of Denmark’s croplands, coasts, and seas, showing the tangible benefits of space data for environmental management and research.\n\n\nThe Copernicus Earth Art Exhibition outside and the Exhibition on the EU Space Programme inside the venue attracted the attention of participants to the Space Conference and the general public passing by.

      "content": "Physicists are questioning whether gravity can produce quantum entanglement between two masses.Credit: David Parker/Science Photo Library\n\nThe nature of gravity — and whether it can be reconciled with quantum mechanics — is one of the biggest mysteries in physics. Most researchers think that at a fundamental level, all phenomena follow the principles of quantum physics, but those principles do not seem to be compatible with the accepted theory of gravity.\n\nFor years, researchers have been proposing experiments to show whether gravity could produce a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. Now, two theoretical physicists have complicated the picture by putting forward a controversial, and seemingly counterintuitive proposal: that gravity could have quantum effects without itself being a quantum theory.\n\nEntanglement occurs when two objects share a common quantum state, meaning that measurements of a property of one object will predict with certainty the results of measurements on the other object. Previous work has suggested that if two quantum objects can be entangled through their mutual gravitational attraction, then that attraction — and therefore gravity itself — should be of quantum nature.\n\nIs gravity quantum? Experiments could finally probe one of physics’ biggest questions\n\nBut, in a paper published in Nature on 22 October1, Richard Howl and Joseph Aziz at Royal Holloway, University of London, argue that such a description is too simplistic. Instead, they argue, gravity could have quantum effects without itself being a quantum theory.\n\nFields matter\n\nIn their study, Howl and Aziz calculated the interactions of two masses on the basis of a simplified version of general relativity, the accepted theory of gravity first introduced by Albert Einstein in 1915. The two researchers worked not in the context of ‘vanilla’ quantum mechanics but in that of quantum field theory — a more advanced formulation of quantum physics in which everything, including matter, is a wave propagating in a quantum field. Therefore, just as photons are waves in an electromagnetic field, electrons become waves in an ‘electron field’.\n\nResearchers have previously shown that the gravitational field of Einstein’s theory cannot produce entanglement2. But Aziz and Howl say that when two masses interact, they do so not only through the gravitational field itself but also through all the ‘matter fields’ — such as the electron field — as well, something that does have the ability to generate entanglement. “When you think more broadly about what a gravitational interaction consists of, then it is possible for classical interactions to create entanglement,” says Howl.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists have long wondered if gravity, the force that pulls objects toward each other, follows the strange rules of quantum physics. Quantum physics explains how tiny things like atoms behave, but it doesn’t easily match with how gravity works in Einstein’s theory.\n\n**What happened** – Two physicists from the University of London, Richard Howl and Joseph Aziz, published a new study on October 22, 2025. They suggested that gravity might cause quantum effects, like entanglement, without being a quantum force itself. Entanglement means two objects can be connected in a way that measuring one instantly tells you about the other.\n\n**Impact** – This idea challenges the usual thinking that if gravity creates entanglement, then gravity must be quantum. Howl and Aziz showed that when two masses interact, they do so through both gravity and other fields, like the electron field, which can produce entanglement. This means gravity might have quantum-like effects even if it isn’t truly quantum. This new view could change how scientists study gravity and quantum physics together.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will now need to test whether this new idea fits with experiments and observations. Future research may explore how gravity and matter fields interact and if this can explain quantum effects without changing gravity’s basic nature.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – A new study suggests gravity might cause quantum connections between objects without being a quantum force itself, offering a fresh way to understand one of physics’ biggest puzzles.",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Les scientifiques se demandent depuis longtemps si la gravité, la force qui attire les objets les uns vers les autres, suit les règles étranges de la physique quantique. La physique quantique explique le comportement des très petites choses comme les atomes, mais elle ne s’accorde pas facilement avec la théorie d’Einstein sur la gravité.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Deux physiciens de l’Université de Londres, Richard Howl et Joseph Aziz, ont publié une nouvelle étude le 22 octobre 2025. Ils ont suggéré que la gravité pourrait provoquer des effets quantiques, comme l’intrication, sans être elle-même une force quantique. L’intrication signifie que deux objets peuvent être liés de telle sorte que mesurer l’un donne instantanément des informations sur l’autre.\n\n**Impact** – Cette idée remet en question la pensée habituelle selon laquelle si la gravité crée de l’intrication, alors la gravité doit être quantique. Howl et Aziz ont montré que lorsque deux masses interagissent, elles le font à travers la gravité mais aussi d’autres champs, comme le champ électronique, qui peuvent créer de l’intrication. Cela signifie que la gravité pourrait avoir des effets semblables à ceux de la physique quantique même si elle n’est pas vraiment quantique. Cette nouvelle vision pourrait changer la façon dont les scientifiques étudient la gravité et la physique quantique ensemble.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques devront maintenant vérifier si cette nouvelle idée correspond aux expériences et observations. Les recherches futures pourraient explorer comment la gravité et les champs de matière interagissent et si cela peut expliquer les effets quantiques sans changer la nature fondamentale de la gravité.\n\n**Résumé en une phrase** – Une nouvelle étude suggère que la gravité pourrait créer des liens quantiques entre objets sans être une force quantique, offrant une nouvelle façon de comprendre l’un des plus grands mystères de la physique.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – Los científicos han preguntado durante mucho tiempo si la gravedad, la fuerza que atrae los objetos entre sí, sigue las reglas extrañas de la física cuántica. La física cuántica explica cómo se comportan las cosas muy pequeñas como los átomos, pero no encaja fácilmente con la teoría de la gravedad de Einstein.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Dos físicos de la Universidad de Londres, Richard Howl y Joseph Aziz, publicaron un nuevo estudio el 22 de octubre de 2025. Sugirieron que la gravedad podría causar efectos cuánticos, como el entrelazamiento, sin ser una fuerza cuántica. El entrelazamiento significa que dos objetos están conectados de manera que medir uno te dice al instante sobre el otro.\n\n**Impacto** – Esta idea desafía el pensamiento común de que si la gravedad crea entrelazamiento, entonces la gravedad debe ser cuántica. Howl y Aziz mostraron que cuando dos masas interactúan, lo hacen a través de la gravedad y también a través de otros campos, como el campo electrónico, que puede producir entrelazamiento. Esto significa que la gravedad podría tener efectos similares a los cuánticos aunque no sea realmente cuántica. Esta nueva visión podría cambiar cómo los científicos estudian la gravedad y la física cuántica juntos.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Ahora los científicos deben probar si esta nueva idea encaja con experimentos y observaciones. Las futuras investigaciones podrían explorar cómo la gravedad y los campos de materia interactúan y si esto puede explicar los efectos cuánticos sin cambiar la naturaleza básica de la gravedad.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Un nuevo estudio sugiere que la gravedad podría causar conexiones cuánticas entre objetos sin ser una fuerza cuántica, ofreciendo una forma nueva de entender uno de los mayores misterios de la física.",
