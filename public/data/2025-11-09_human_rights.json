      "summary": "The 2023–2029 Language Policy Concept aims to expand the use of Kazakh across science, IT, media, and governance, including the transition from the Cyrillic script to the Latin.",
      "content": "The Kazakh government promotes the Kazakh language through strategic initiatives, such as mandatory Kazakh language testing for civil servants, while its use by the general population is gaining momentum across various sectors. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kazakhstan has sought to reshape its language policy.\n\nThe 2023–2029 Language Policy Concept aims to expand the use of Kazakh across science, IT, media, and governance, including the transition from the Cyrillic script to the Latin alphabet. Recently, 13 projects in media and information services were launched to establish modern approaches and address the challenges facing the Kazakh language.\n\nAccording to the Minister of Culture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Aida Balaeva, Kazakh-language media consumption is now dominant, with “80 percent of the audience consuming media content in Kazakh.” Although independent statistics cannot confirm this figure, it does reflect an upward trend.\n\nThe inclusion of the Kazakh language in Hollywood dubbing, one of just 30 languages, signals growing international recognition, driven by rising domestic demand. Besides, social media, bloggers, and the integration of the Kazakh language in various apps and video games make the language more accessible for the younger generation.\n\nThis has not always been the case, however. These changes have unfolded as a slow trend, according to Rustam Burnashev, Associate Professor at the Faculty for Global Politics at the German-Kazakh University in Almaty.\n\nIn an interview with Global Voices, Burnashev recalled: “Kazakh, as a language of education, has been overlooked since the dominance of Russian during the Soviet period. Nowadays, it is the civic symbol of the country.”\n\nFigures show that the number of enrollments into Kazakh schools rose from 32.4 percent in 1991 to 66 percent in 2019. This may indicate that knowledge of Russian and its use are declining among the youth. Russian proficiency is regionally concentrated, mostly in the north and central parts, which house large populations of ethnic Russians.\n\nDemographics and the use of the Kazakh language\n\nThe widespread use of Russian as a lingua franca is rooted in Kazakhstan’s Soviet legacy, during which many ethnic minorities were deported to the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, forcing Kazakh to private life and rural entities.\n\nThese resettlements often led to the formation of multiethnic communities, where Russian emerged as the practical medium of communication.\n\nHere is a YouTube video about the aftermath of the Russification of Kazakhstan.\n\nNow, 34 years after the country gained independence, much has changed. Many non-Kazakhs left, new people migrated to Kazakhstan, and many more have been born during Kazakhstan’s independent era.\n\nDuring the first years of Kazakhstan’s independence, the question remained how to form a Kazakh titular nation, where ethnic Kazakhs comprised less than half of the population. Today, this number is over 70 percent.\n\nOn the one hand, repatriated Kazakhs are accelerating linguistic shifts in both rural and urban areas. Since 1991, Kazakhstan’s “Oralman” (Returnee) repatriation program has brought around one million ethnic Kazakhs, many of whom do not speak Russian, back to Kazakhstan.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of ethnic Russians has been decreasing since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Many of those who chose to stay see the Kazakh language as a means of empowerment.\n\n“Nowadays, there are groups of ethnic Russians that started learning Kazakh to set a staple: We belong to Kazakhstan, not to our imperialistic neighbor up north,” explained Beate Eschment, Researcher at the Centre for East European and International Studies in Berlin, Germany, in an interview with Global Voices.\n\nFrom Soviet legacy to national strategy\n\nIn 1989, the law on languages ​​in the Kazakh SSR gave Kazakh the title of official language, while Russian remained as the language of inter-ethnic communication. Two years later, Kazakhstan gained independence from the Soviet Union. In 1995, the constitution gave the Kazakh language the title of state language and granted Russian official status. Since then, several initiatives have followed.\n\nThe National Program for the Development and Functioning of Languages for 2011–2019 aimed to boost fluency in Kazakh, Russian, and English, with ambitious goals of increasing it by as much as 90 percent for the Kazakh and Russian languages. While official reports see the initiative as a success, independent assessments remain skeptical, given that, as of 2019, only 67.9 percent of the population were ethnic Kazakhs.\n\nNonetheless, the program helped reposition the Kazakh language in society. Kazakh educational institutions gained popularity, and Kazakh-language entertainment began to flourish. Rather than diminishing the penetration of the Russian language, the result appears to be a side-by-side development, with growing emphasis on Kazakh in almost all spheres of society.\n\nThe first and former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, promoted the idea of “unity through diversity,” which was successful in interethnic relations.\n\n“Nazarbayev had to rebuild the Kazakh nation from scratch. He couldn’t tell all the minorities: “Go back home, we don’t want you here.” Looking at inter-ethnic tensions in Tajikistan [at that time], it would have been a very risky maneuver,” explains Olivier Ferrando, Research Professor at the Human Rights Institute of Lyon Catholic University in France, in an interview with Global Voices.\n\n“Under the current president, [Kassym-Jomart] Tokayev, especially the rhetoric has changed. What is striking, however, is his shift of focus from a diverse nation to an inclusive one,” elaborates Olivier Ferrando.\n\nNowadays, the Kazakh language is viewed as a necessary means for all citizens to participate in political, social, and economic life.\n\nCivil society and linguistic tensions\n\nThe changes in Kazakhstan’s language landscape are unfolding together with public scandals, court cases, and tensions in society. One example of it is the case of Yermek Taichibekov, a blogger who was imprisoned for labeling Kazakhstan’s language policy as “Russophobic” in 2021. Another case involves Temirlan Yensebek, the founder of the satirical news site Qaznews24, who was charged with inciting interethnic discord for sharing an offensive rap song about the Russian minority in Kazakhstan.\n\nThere are two opposing camps in this debate. One side is advocating for decolonization and aggressively promoting national identity and linguistic sovereignty. The second is warning against what they perceive as growing anti-Russian sentiment in Kazakhstan.\n\nHere is a YouTube video about the current state of the Russian and Kazakh languages.\n\nActivists on both sides of the spectrum are increasingly in conflict with each other, each advancing their agendas through the lens of ethnic identity. This is expected given that language has never been a neutral medium. It is both shaped by politics and a tool that shapes the political order itself.\n\nThe rise of Kazakh as a national language is not simply the outcome of state enforcement. “It is not only to be considered an aversion of the ‘russkij mir’ (Russian world)-ideology, but much more of an intrinsic motivation of self-preservation,” says Beate Eschment.\n\nGiven the Kremlin’s increasingly aggressive and hostile rhetoric toward Kazakhstan since the start of the war in Ukraine, it is unlikely that Russia is content with the current linguistic and social discourses in Kazakh society.\n\nThe Kazakh government is balancing a fine line between linguistic sovereignty, the dominant position of the Russian language, and an erratic and unpredictable neighbor. Under these circumstances, the fate and flourishing of the Kazakh language falls on the shoulders of people in Kazakhstan, who will be a driving factor and ensure state policies take shape.",

Kazakh is becoming a symbol of national pride and belonging. Even Hollywood movies are now dubbed in Kazakh, showing growing recognition of the language. This shift helps unite the country while respecting its ethnic diversity.\n\n**What's next step** – The government will continue to support Kazakh language projects and education. People in Kazakhstan will play a key role in making sure the language grows stronger across all parts of society. The move to the Latin alphabet will also continue, making Kazakh easier to use internationally.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Kazakhstan is actively promoting the Kazakh language to strengthen national identity and unite its diverse population through education, media, and government reforms.",

      "content": "Roughly 1.3 million international students and recent graduates enrolled in work training are in the United States for the 2025–26 academic year.Credit: Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe/Getty\n\nInternational students in the United States have defied predictions of a huge downturn in their population. Data for the current academic year show that the number of international students — including PhD candidates and newly minted PhDs — has remained essentially flat, year-on-year.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has shaken up the landscape of higher education, revoking student visas, cutting funds to institutions and implementing travel bans for selected countries. As a result, many higher-education researchers had expected significant numbers of overseas students to turn away from US academia.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nIn July, NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a non-profit organization in Washington DC, predicted that the number of overseas students in the United States would decline by 15% between the previous academic year and this one. And in October, The New York Times reported a 20% drop in the number of students arriving in the United States in August 2025 compared with August 2024, a finding based on data from the US Department of Commerce.\n\nBut data released by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for September and October show almost no change in the population of international students and recent graduates in the United States between this year and last — and specialists say these data are more reliable than others.\n\n“It doesn’t appear to be as catastrophic as had been originally feared,” says Chris Glass, a higher-education researcher at Boston College in Massachusetts.\n\nData points\n\nThe DHS statistics, which are part of a database called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), track students enrolled in educational institutes and recent graduates gaining work experience in a programme called optional practical training (OPT). OPT is one of the largest foreign talent pipelines to the United States, feeding thousands of people into Amazon, Google and other leading companies. It is key for people doing PhDs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) topics: between 2010 and 2022, 76% of recent graduates took part in it.\n\nAccording to SEVIS data, roughly 1.3 million international students and OPT participants are in the United States for the 2025–26 academic year — about the same as the number for the 2024–25 academic year. The total number of doctoral students also remained nearly the same year-on-year (see ‘Surprising stability’).\n\nSource: SEVIS, NAFSA: Association of International Educators\n\nSEVIS data do not distinguish between recent graduates involved in OPT and students still enrolled in educational institutes. Glass says that, given recent trends, the number of OPT participants might have grown by about 15% between 2024 and 2025. If so, that would mean a “modest single-digit enrolment decline”, leading the total number of students and graduates to remain flat.\n\nWhat, then, might explain the 20% decline in student arrivals in August recorded by the commerce department? The August arrival data “aren’t all that great of a proxy” for the international-student population, says Violet Buxton-Walsh, an immigration researcher at the Institute for Progress, a non-profit think tank in Washington DC. Many international students could have heeded advice to stay in the United States between the end of the 2024–25 school year and the start of the 2025–26 year. If they did, they would not have been included in the August arrivals data, Buxton-Walsh says. Others might have arrived in September rather than August because of visa delays.\n\nThe relatively steady numbers might seem puzzling, given the headlines about the Trump administration’s anti-immigration actions. But “international students are incredibly resilient”, says Melissa Whatley, a higher-education researcher at the William & Mary School of Education in Williamsburg, Virginia. “They’re going to attend institutions and earn degrees under circumstances that we think might deter them.”\n\nDeterrence policy",
