      "title": "The solar mission that survived disaster and found 5,000 comets",
      "summary": "For thirty years, SOHO has watched the Sun from a stable perch in space, revealing the inner workings of our star and surviving crises that nearly ended the mission. Its long-term observations uncovered a single global plasma conveyor belt inside the Sun, detailed how solar brightness subtly shifts over the solar cycle, and turned SOHO into an unexpected comet-hunting champion with more than 5,000 discoveries.",
      "content": "On December 2, 1995, the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) lifted off for what was originally planned as a two-year mission.\n\nFrom a position 1.5 million km away from Earth, located between our planet and the Sun, SOHO has an uninterrupted view of the solar surface. Since launch, it has provided an almost unbroken record of solar activity spanning nearly three full 11-year solar cycles.\n\n\"It is testament to the ingenuity of our engineers, operators and scientists, and to international collaboration, that this mission has exceeded all expectations,\" says Prof. Carole Mundell, ESA Director of Science. \"SOHO has overcome nail-biting challenges to become one of the longest-operating space missions of all time.\"\n\n\"The SOHO mission is a great example of the incredible partnerships between NASA and ESA,\" adds Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Congratulations to the NASA and ESA teams on an amazing thirty years working together.\"\n\nDespite its achievements, SOHO's journey has not been smooth. About two-and-a-half years after launch, the spacecraft experienced a major malfunction that sent it into an uncontrolled spin and severed communications with Earth. For three months, an international team worked continuously to find the spacecraft and bring it back to life.\n\nAnother serious setback occurred in November and December 1998, when its stabilizing gyroscopes failed. Engineers quickly developed new software, and by February 1999, SOHO could operate without gyroscopes. This breakthrough allowed it to continue gathering data that would go on to reshape the field of solar science.\n\n\"SOHO pioneered new fields in solar science. It is a game-changer in the study of space weather, providing real-time monitoring of the Sun to forecast potentially dangerous solar storms heading towards Earth, and its legacy continues to guide future missions,\" says Daniel Müller, ESA Project Scientist for SOHO and Solar Orbiter.\n\n\"SOHO is still producing high-quality data on a daily basis, and with hundreds of papers being published every year, its scientific productivity remains very high.\"\n\nDaniel's new paper 'SOHO's 30-year legacy of observing the Sun' was published in Nature Astronomy on December 2, 2025.\n\nHere are five highlights from the last five years:\n\n1. A single plasma conveyor belt\n\nSOHO became a leading instrument in the development of helioseismology, which studies how sound waves move through the Sun in a way similar to how seismic waves reveal the interior of Earth. Early in the mission, SOHO captured the first images of plasma flows (electrically charged material) beneath the solar surface, giving scientists an unprecedented look inside the Sun.\n\nBecause SOHO has remained active for so long, researchers have been able to answer a long-standing question: plasma circulates in a single loop, or cell, within each hemisphere of the Sun, instead of in multiple cells as once believed.\n\nThe observations show that plasma takes roughly 22 years to complete this full circuit. It rises from regions near the equator toward the poles before sinking deep inside the Sun and moving back toward the equator. This timing matches the Sun's magnetic cycle and helps explain why sunspots, which are produced when strong magnetic fields break through the surface, tend to appear progressively closer to the equator as each solar cycle unfolds.\n\n2. Does the Sun shine steadily?\n\nMeasuring the energy emitted by the Sun is essential for understanding how solar heating influences Earth's atmosphere and climate. SOHO's long-running record, paired with earlier datasets, now provides nearly fifty years of high-quality observations.\n\nScientists have found that the Sun's total energy output changes very little, varying by only about 0.06% over the solar cycle. However, its extreme ultraviolet radiation changes far more significantly, doubling between solar minimum and solar maximum. This form of radiation affects the chemistry and temperature in Earth's upper atmosphere, but it is not a direct cause of the long-term warming trend near the planet's surface.\n\n3. Solar storm monitoring made law\n\nSOHO has played such a pivotal role in the development of real-time space weather monitoring systems that it was signed into United States law in October 2020.\n\nThe 'Promoting Research and Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow' (PROSWIFT) act specifically mentions SOHO's Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instrument.\n\nLASCO is a coronagraph, a telescope with a disc masking the centre of view. By blocking out the direct light coming from the Sun, the instrument can see light from the surrounding atmosphere, called the corona. This allows us to see coronal mass ejections -- large eruptions of solar material and magnetic fields -- as they set off from the Sun, providing up to three days warning of potentially disruptive incoming space weather reaching Earth.\n\n4. 5,000 comets -- and counting!\n\nThe telescope's prowess as a comet hunter was unplanned, but turned out to be an unexpected success. Thanks to the screening effect of SOHO's coronagraph, 'sungrazer' comets -- those that approach the Sun at very close distances -- also become visible.\n\nNot all comets seen by SOHO are sungrazers. For example, it also beautifully captured Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, also called the Great Comet of 2024, a non-periodic comet from the outer reaches of the Solar System.\n\nSOHO discovered its 5,000th comet in March 2024, making it the most prolific comet-discoverer in history. Most of these have been found by citizen scientists worldwide through the Sungrazer Project. The observations have provided valuable data on the movement, composition and dust production of comets.\n\n5. Enabling future discoveries\n\nSOHO's longevity and accomplishments have influenced the design, goals, and collaborative approach of new solar observatories. It has also helped set standards for open data and international cooperation in solar research.\n\nFor example, the ESA-led Solar Orbiter mission is imaging the solar poles from higher latitude and flying much closer to the Sun, with many of its instruments being successors of SOHO's. Similarly, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory carries improved versions of SOHO's instruments to continue the legacy that SOHO began in areas of full-disc imaging and helioseismology. Moreover, SOHO frequently contributes to 'multipoint' measurements, providing essential context for Solar Orbiter and NASA's Parker Solar Probe as they fly along their own unique orbits around the Sun.\n\nEven more recently, ESA's Proba-3 took to the skies to open up new views of the Sun's faint corona, while the Agency's upcoming Vigil mission will be the first to monitor the Sun from the 'side', detecting solar storms before they roll into SOHO's line-of-sight.\n\n\"SOHO is an all-round shining success, thanks to the dedication of the teams keeping this incredible machine flying,\" says Daniel. \"Its science remains valuable and relevant, serving generations of scientists, and I'm certain that its legacy will continue to guide solar science for decades to come.\"",

      "title": "JWST finds a Milky Way twin born shockingly early in the Universe",
      "summary": "A surprisingly mature spiral galaxy named Alaknanda has been spotted just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang—far earlier than astronomers believed such well-structured galaxies could form. With sweeping spiral arms, rapid star formation, and an orderly disk resembling our Milky Way, it defies long-held theories about how slowly galaxies should assemble. Thanks to JWST and gravitational lensing, researchers could examine the galaxy in remarkable detail, revealing that the early Universe was far more capable and dynamic than expected.",
      "content": "Astronomers have identified a spiral galaxy that looks strikingly similar to the Milky Way in a period of the Universe when such organized systems were not expected to exist. Two researchers in India spotted this unusually developed galaxy only 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, a timing that calls long-established ideas of galaxy growth into question.\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which can detect extremely faint and distant light, made the find possible. With its powerful infrared vision, researchers Rashi Jain and Yogesh Wadadekar observed a system that closely resembles the Milky Way, even though it formed when the Universe was roughly a tenth of its current age. They named the galaxy Alaknanda, inspired by a Himalayan river that is one of the twin headstreams of the Ganga alongside the Mandakini, a name that also happens to be the Hindi word for the Milky Way.\n\nThis work was conducted at the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR) in Pune, India, and the results appear in the European journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nWhy This Galaxy Should Not Exist So Early\n\nAstronomers typically expect early galaxies to look chaotic and irregular rather than structured and stable. Classic spiral galaxies with two well-shaped arms (known as a 'grand-design' spiral) are thought to require several billion years to fully develop. Forming such a galaxy involves slow, steady gas accretion, the settling of that gas into a rotating disk, and the emergence of density waves that sculpt spiral arms. On top of that, the system must avoid major collisions that could disrupt or destroy its delicate structure.\n\nAlaknanda does not fit this pattern at all. It already displays two prominent, sweeping arms that encircle a bright central bulge, stretching across about 30,000 light-years. It is also forming stars at an exceptional pace, creating the equivalent mass of about 60 Suns each year. That rate is about 20 times faster than the Milky Way today. Roughly half of the stars in Alaknanda seem to have formed within only 200 million years, which is extremely rapid on cosmic timescales.\n\n\"Alaknanda has the structural maturity we associate with galaxies that are billions of years older,\" says Rashi Jain. \"Finding such a well-organized spiral disk at this epoch tells us that the physical processes driving galaxy formation -- gas accretion, disk settling, and possibly the development of spiral density waves -- can operate far more efficiently than current models predict. It's forcing us to rethink our theoretical framework.\"\n\nHow Gravitational Lensing Helped Reveal Alaknanda\n\nAlaknanda appears in the direction of a massive galaxy cluster known as Abell 2744, or Pandora's Cluster. The cluster's gravity bends and amplifies the light from galaxies behind it, an effect called gravitational lensing. This natural magnification made Alaknanda appear about twice as bright, giving JWST a clearer view of its spiral structure.\n\nTo study the galaxy in depth, Jain and Wadadekar examined JWST images taken through up to 21 different filters, each capturing a separate slice of its light. These observations, part of JWST's UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys, allowed the researchers to determine the galaxy's distance, the amount of dust it contains, how many stars it has formed, and how its star formation rate has changed over time with unusual precision.\n\nA Universe That Grew Up Faster Than Expected\n\nJWST has already revealed several surprisingly mature disk galaxies at great distances, but Alaknanda stands out as one of the clearest early examples of a classic grand-design spiral (a galaxy with two well-defined, symmetric arms). Its existence adds to growing evidence that the early Universe was far more advanced than scientists once thought.\n\n\"Alaknanda reveals that the early Universe was capable of far more rapid galaxy assembly than we anticipated,\" says Yogesh Wadadekar. \"Somehow, this galaxy managed to pull together ten billion solar masses of stars and organize them into a beautiful spiral disk in just a few hundred million years. That's extraordinarily fast by cosmic standards, and it compels astronomers to rethink how galaxies form.\"\n\nResearchers now want to understand what created Alaknanda's spiral arms. One idea is that steady inflows of cold gas allowed density waves to naturally shape the arms. Another possibility is that a smaller companion galaxy passed close enough to trigger the spiral pattern, although such tidal spirals usually fade quickly. Follow-up observations using JWST's spectroscopic instruments or the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile could reveal whether the disk rotates smoothly (dynamically \"cold\") or shows signs of turbulence (dynamically \"hot\"), providing clues to its formation.\n\nWhat This Discovery Means for Understanding Cosmic History\n\nAlaknanda is more than an impressive image from the distant past. Its presence forces astronomers to reevaluate the timeline of cosmic evolution, including how stars, galaxies, and ultimately planets such as Earth came into existence. If galaxies could organize themselves this quickly, then the early Universe was a far more active and productive environment than previously assumed, potentially allowing planetary systems to emerge earlier than expected.\n\nAs JWST continues to push deeper into space and time, more galaxies like Alaknanda are likely to be found, each offering new insight into how rapidly the early Universe built complex structures.\n\nThe existence of Alaknanda strengthens the case that the young Universe was capable of forming stable, disk-dominated systems much earlier than scientists believed, making it one of the most distant grand-design spiral galaxies ever identified.",

      "summary": "Earth’s orbit is getting crowded with broken satellites and leftover rocket parts. Researchers say the solution is to build spacecraft that can be repaired, reused, or recycled instead of abandoned. They also want new tools to collect old debris and new data systems that help prevent collisions. The goal is to make space exploration cleaner and more sustainable.",
      "content": "Each rocket launch sends valuable materials into the sky that cannot be recovered, while also releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases and chemicals that damage the ozone layer. A new paper published December 1 in the Cell Press journal Chem Circularity examines how familiar ideas like reducing, reusing, and recycling could be built into the way satellites and spacecraft are designed, repaired in orbit, and handled at the end of their service lives.\n\n\"As space activity accelerates, from mega-constellations of satellites to future lunar and Mars missions, we must make sure exploration doesn't repeat the mistakes made on Earth,\" says senior author and chemical engineer Jin Xuan of the University of Surrey. \"A truly sustainable space future starts with technologies, materials and systems working together.\"\n\nGrowing debris and the problem of abandoned satellites\n\nThe environmental toll continues long after launch. Most spacecraft and satellites are never recycled, which means that large amounts of material are permanently lost when missions end. Many older satellites are shifted into \"graveyard orbits,\" while others become drifting orbital debris that can disrupt the operation of active systems.\n\nThe authors argue that this approach cannot continue, especially with the increasing pace of private space missions. They highlight the need for a circular space economy, a model in which materials and equipment are created with reuse, repair, and recycling in mind. They also note that industries such as personal electronics and automotive manufacturing have already adopted similar ideas with considerable success.\n\n\"Our motivation was to bring the conversation about circularity into the space domain, where it's long overdue,\" says Xuan. \"Circular economy thinking is transforming materials and manufacturing on Earth, but it's rarely applied to satellites, rockets, or space habitats.\"\n\nApplying the 3 Rs to spacecraft, satellites, and space stations\n\nAccording to the team, the foundation of a circular space economy lies in the 3 Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Reducing waste would begin with building satellites and spacecraft that last longer and can be fixed more easily in space. They also suggest turning space stations into multifunctional centers where spacecraft can refuel, undergo repairs, or even have new components manufactured, which could cut down on the number of launches required.\n\nThe authors add that bringing spacecraft and space stations safely back to Earth for reuse would require better recovery systems, including technologies such as parachutes and airbags. They point out that equipment in space experiences significant wear because of extreme temperatures and radiation, so any part intended for reuse would need to pass strict safety checks.\n\nRecovering orbital debris and using advanced technology for safer space operations\n\nThe researchers also recommend new efforts to gather orbital debris, such as using robotic arms or nets to collect fragments so the materials can be recycled. This would also help prevent collisions that create even more debris.\n\nData-driven tools will play an important role in this transition, the authors say. Information gathered from spacecraft could guide improvements in design and help limit waste, while simulation tools may reduce the need for expensive physical testing. They add that AI systems could help spacecraft and satellites avoid dangerous debris in real time.\n\nTransforming the entire space system through innovation and global cooperation\n\nThe authors emphasize that a circular space economy represents a major shift in how the space sector works. Instead of focusing on single pieces of hardware, the entire system needs to be considered at once, from the materials used to how spacecraft are operated and retired.\n\n\"We need innovation at every level, from materials that can be reused or recycled in orbit and modular spacecraft that can be upgraded instead of discarded, to data systems that track how hardware ages in space,\" says Xuan.\n\n\"But just as importantly, we need international collaboration and policy frameworks to encourage reuse and recovery beyond Earth. The next phase is about connecting chemistry, design, and governance to turn sustainability into the default model for space.\"\n\nThis research received support from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Leverhulme Trust, and the Surrey-Adelaide Partnership Fund.",
