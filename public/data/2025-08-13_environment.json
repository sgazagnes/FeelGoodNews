      "content": "When woven together, the tapestry of experiences of staff and scientists provide the complete picture of OCO-2.\n\nBreathe in... Breathe out.\n\nThis simple rhythm sets the foundation of life on Earth – and it’s a pattern that a NASA satellite has been watching from space for over a decade.\n\nOn July 2, 2024, NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) celebrated 10 years since its launch. Built by NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA/JPL), OCO-2 is now viewed as the gold standard for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) measurements from space and has quietly become a powerful driver of technological, ecological and even economic progress – including providing unexpected insights into plant health, crop-yield forecasting, drought early warning systems, and forest and rangeland management.\n\nWhile the mission can point to many scientific achievements – some of which will be highlighted in the pages that follow – these accomplishments have occurred in the context of a larger human story. Scientists from around the world have come together to bring the important data from this satellite to the broader community, making OCO-2 the success that it is today.\n\nThis article provides readers an introduction to several transformative characters in this carbon story. The text peers behind the scenes to reveal the circuitous path that scientists and engineers must navigate to take a brilliant scientific concept and turn it into flight hardware that can be launched into space to make beneficial observations. The article depicts milestones that mark the mission’s successes, but also the failures, dead ends, long nights, and discouragements that make up the complexity of any science story.\n\n2003: The First OCO Science Team Meeting\n\nMeasuring CO 2 from space: Great idea but can it really be done?\n\nWhen the idea for OCO was first proposed, it wasn’t universally embraced. At the time, more than a few experts scoffed at the idea that CO 2 could be measured from space. Unlike nitrogen and oxygen, which are the dominant components of Earth’s atmosphere, CO 2 is a trace gas, often no more than a few hundred parts per million. Miniscule, elusive, and nomadic, these measurements, though challenging, are crucial because of the important role CO 2 plays in global climate.\n\nIn April 2003, a handful of hopeful scientists gathered at the California Institute for Technology (Caltech) for the first OCO Science Team meeting. To mark the occasion, they took a break during the meetings and lined up for a group photo – see Photo 1. Upon returning to work, they took up the arduous task of determining how to measure CO 2 from space with a satellite and instrument hardware that simply did not exist.\n\nOCO-2 was developed as part of NASA’s Earth System Science Pathfinder program, which supports small, low-cost missions that can still provide tremendous value for high-impact goals. The satellite carries a high-resolution spectrometer that collects data in three, narrow spectral bands. These spectral bands follow a divide and conquer strategy – two measure the clear “fingerprint” that CO 2 leaves when it absorbs sunlight, and one takes the same measurement for oxygen (O 2 ). The satellite is able to estimate CO 2 concentrations by comparing the CO 2 and O 2 measurements.\n\nPhoto 1.

But this night was special. They were lined up in a crowd waiting for a bus to take them to Vandenberg Air Force Base (now Space Force Base) in California. The group huddled in the chill night air awaiting the launch of the OCO satellite into the cosmos.\n\nShortly after midnight, hundreds of guests spread blankets across the gravelly ground to make their wait more comfortable. The air was charged with excitement. The participants waited quietly, murmuring to one another while the soft slosh of the Pacific Ocean offered a steady pendulum counting down to the impending launch. Like most people there that night, Vivienne felt upbeat and excited, but she also understood the gravity of the moment – a lot was riding on this launch.\n\nWhile Vivienne had not been part of OCO since inception – having joined the project in 2012 – she knew OCO’s story. The first launch in 2009 ended in failure – when a faulty launch vehicle doomed the first OCO to a watery grave just moments after launch. In the aftermath, the OCO community were left in limbo, unsure if the project would survive. All was not lost. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) had successfully launched the Greenhouse-gas Observing satellite (GOSAT or IBUKI, Japanese for “breath”) that same year. This launch gave the OCO team an opportunity to test and refine their methods and algorithms using data from GOSAT.\n\nAs the gravel poked through the thick flannel blankets, Vivienne shifted uncomfortably waiting for the interminable countdown to reach its conclusion – and then everything stopped. A technical issue was detected, triggering a command to abort the launch.\n\nVivienne tried to explain to her disappointed daughter that this was simply how things went with space work. Sometimes you put in 1000 work-years of labor, get up in the middle of the night, and sit on uneven ground just to have everything stopped, unceremoniously.\n\nFortunately, the problem was quickly resolved, and the launch was rescheduled for the very next night. The participants returned to the staging site – rinse and repeat. This time Vivienne’s daughter was decidedly more sluggish. At 3:00 AM PDT, OCO-2 launched flawlessly into space. Unfortunately, a layer of fog obscured the spectators' view. While it could not be seen, the resounding boom of the rocket taking off could be heard for miles.\n\nFor Vivienne, the sonic boom shocked the ears and rumbled through the bodies of the assembled crowd, who erupted in cheers. Having invested a lot of her time in the OCO project during the past two years, she was thrilled to see a successful launch.\n\nAs they returned to their hotel, Vivienne’s daughter remained unimpressed. “Mummy, let’s not do that again,” she said as she splayed out on the hotel bed and soon fell fast asleep.\n\n2014: OCO-2 Joins A Larger Earth Observing Story\n\nLeading to surprising new insights about how we see plants – and fires.\n\nWhen OCO-2 launched in 2014, it joined a tightly coordinated group of Earth-observing satellites known as the Afternoon Constellation (or the “A-Train”) – see Figure 1. Flying in formation, the satellites could combine their observations to unlock more than any one mission could reveal on its own. Around the same time, scientists discovered that OCO-2 could do more than measure CO 2 – it could also detect signs of plant health.\n\nFigure 1. As of January 2024, the international Afternoon Constellation (“A-Train”) has two missions remaining: OCO-2 and GCOM-W. While Aqua and Aura continue to collect science data, the satellites have both slowly drifted out of the constellation – and will soon be decommissioned. CALIPSO ended its scientific mission on August 1, 2023. CloudSat radar operations ceased on December 20, 2023. Figure credit: NASA\n\nThis discovery opened the possibilities for many different people, including Madeleine Festin, a former wildland firefighter in Montana, to work with OCO-2 data through an internship sponsored by the DEVELOP program, under the Earth Action element (formerly known as Applied Sciences) of NASA’s Earth Science Division.\n\nWhen she was on the ground battling fires, Madeleine faced the harsh reality that fire prediction is notoriously difficult. In the field, she might be surrounded by smoke with just 20 ft (6 m) of visibility and red flames tearing through dry brush. Through her internship, she’s continued to tackle fires – just from a very different vantage point.\n\nOCO-2 can detect the faint glow given off by plants during photosynthesis. This glow, called solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), offers a fast, sensitive indicator of plant health – see Figure 2. While other satellite-based tools, such as soil moisture or vegetation indices often detect stress only after damage has already occurred, SIF values drop the moment photosynthesis slows down – even if the plant still looks green. These data open the door to new applications: monitoring crop performance, identifying flood-damaged areas, and tracking drought before it sparks wildfires. That’s exactly how Madeleine is now using the data.\n\nMadeleine’s team, a collaboration between OCO-2 scientists and the U.S. Forest Service, is working to update fire-risk models – some of which were developed in the 1980s – by incorporating SIF data.\n\n“It’s fulfilling to know that you’re helping people,” Madeleine says. “And it’s nice to see science and firefighting work align.”\n\nWhat makes the data even more powerful is OCO-2’s synergy with its A-Train counterpart, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on NASA’S Aqua platform. MODIS contributes land-cover information that, when paired with OCO-2’s SIF measurements, creates a detailed, global dataset of plant photosynthesis far beyond what either satellite could produce on its own. This example is a perfect synergistic pairing of measurements the A-Train has made possible. This information gives Madeleine and her team a better foundation for improving fire prediction tools.\n\n“When firefighting, I used to hear about all these fire indices and metrics, and never knew what they meant,” Madeleine says. “Now, I’m learning the science behind it. And it’s interesting to think about how to get that information to firefighters on the ground, without overburdening them. What do they really need to know, and how can we deliver it in a way that helps?”\n\nFigure 2. OCO-2 can measure plant health and photosynthesis from space. Puente Hills in eastern Los Angeles County, CA was once one of the largest landfills in the United States. The landfill has since been closed and its surface replanted to resemble a natural hill rising above the surrounding densely populated neighborhoods. These two images show how solar induced fluorescence (SIF), or “plant glow,” measured from OCO-2 and OCO-3 can be used to study urban greenery. The satellite image of the landfill and surrounding area [left] is followed by the SIF data overlay [right]. It is possible to compare the photosynthetic activity in the reclaimed landfill to nearby green spaces, as well as the plant health in the surrounding neighborhoods.

After skirting the Sequoia Forest and stopping for the night just past the Nevada border, she led a caravan of scientists along Highway 6 to mile marker 100, turning right onto a dirt road between two fence posts. Traveling 10 mi (16.5 km) down the road, a cloud of dust raised up from the car tires before the vehicle came to a stop at their destination – a patch of spindly instruments hammered into the barren desert floor. A big plaque marked the spot with the NASA logo and the words, “Satellite Test Site.” Standing under vast blue sky, Carol felt like she’d come home. Over the past few years, Carol had grown accustomed to leading these summer expeditions to Railroad Valley, NV. Often the team from JPL is joined by guests from Japan and other international colleagues representing various satellite missions – see Photo 2.\n\nPhoto 2. Group photo at Railroad Valley, NV during a summer field campaign. Carol Bruegge [OCO-2—Technologist, fifth from left] joins JPL members and guests from Japan working on the Greenhouse-gas Observing satellite. The group included [left to right] Hirokazu Yamamoto, Atsushi Yasuda, Hideaki Nakajima, Kei Shiomi, Thomas Pongetti, Bruegge, Dejian Fu, Junko Fukuchi, Makoto Saito, and Rio Kajiura. Photo credit: Tom Pongetti\n\nCarol knew that a successful field campaign required that they protect the instruments from the thick corrosive salt on the ground. Then the work could begin. The team hiked through the desert, collecting data that would ensure that OCO-2 could continue to provide high-quality data. As they hiked, the team carried hand-held spectrometers and measured the reflection of sunlight off Earth’s surface – timed precisely to match the moment the satellite passes overhead. By comparing the satellite’s readings with the ground-based measurements, the team can check the accuracy of the satellite readings. Reflection is one ingredient used in calculating the concentration of CO 2 in the overlying air.\n\nThis remote location in Nevada wasn’t chosen by accident. In this part of the desert, the ground is perfectly flat, free of plants, and surrounded by ground littered with salt. This smooth, bare surface means no bumps and textures could disrupt the signal. For satellite calibration, it doesn’t get better than this.\n\n2018: A Contentious Meeting in Noordwijk, Netherlands Sparks A Revolution\n\nCould OCO-2 data be used to construct a nation-by-nation CO 2 budget?\n\nDavid Crisp [JPL emeritus—original OCO Principal Investigator and former OCO Science Team Leader] was tired. He didn’t know if it was jet lag or a reflection of the 16- to 18-hour workdays that had persisted for weeks. This particular week had started with a 10-hour flight from Los Angeles to the Netherlands. Now, he was standing in front of carbon scientists who had gathered from around the world.\n\n“We need to put together a team that will be brave enough to make a CO 2 budget, nation-by-nation,” David said.\n\nHis statement was met with thoughtful silence. Neither the data nor the models were ready. The consensus in the room was that the proposed venture may not work. David was magnanimous toward his critics, but he persisted with his idea.\n\nDespite the rocky start, David met with representatives in charge of creating national emission inventories. He could see exasperation on their faces – running ragged, short-staffed, and trying to tally up every single barrel of oil and bushel of coal burned within their country’s boundaries. Even more challenging was tallying other tasks, such as deforestation and agricultural practices. David firmly believed that if OCO-2 could provide independent estimates from space as promised, it would provide the on-the-ground “carbon accountants” a reliable comparison – see Figure 3.\n\n“We might have a satellite that can help,” Dave told them.\n\nAlthough David has since retired, his perseverance is now bearing fruit. What began as a hypothetical solution is now much closer to reality. OCO-2’s high-precision measurements can now detect CO 2 linked not just to countries, but large cities, industrial zones, and even individual power plants – all while researchers continue perfecting efforts to identify contributions from specific city sectors. OCO-2 provides a valuable, independent reference that nations can use to track the progress of their emission inventories. Researchers have created an entire OCO-2-sourced database of CO 2 estimates by country, available through the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center.\n\nFigure 3. A map of the net emissions and removals of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) for 2015–2020 using estimates informed by OCO-2. Green depressions represent countries that remove more CO 2 than emitted. Tan or red ridges represent countries with higher CO 2 emissions than removed.

The satellite's unique orbit gives it a new vantage point. While OCO-2 continues to orbit Earth in a near-polar path, OCO-3 travels aboard the ISS in a lower, shifting orbit that allows it to study different areas of Earth’s surface at different times of day. OCO-3 also features a special scanning mode, called the snapshot area mapping (SAM) that lets scientists zoom in on areas of interest (e.g., cities or volcanoes) to study carbon emissions and vegetation in greater detail. Together, OCO-2 and OCO-3 provide complementary perspectives on Earth’s carbon cycle and plant health at space and time resolutions that have not been possible from space before.\n\n2021: LA During a Pandemic Is a Far Cry from Finland\n\nA data scientist foregoes saunas and berry-picking to make the dream of OCO-2 a reality.\n\nOtto Lamminpää [JPL—Data Scientist] opened the picture his sister had texted him. His family looked back with wide smiles, holding buckets overflowing with scarlet berries and framed by the velvety firs of Finland. It had been almost two years since he’d seen them in person. He’d moved to Los Angeles to work at JPL on the OCO-2 and OCO-3 mission just as the COVID-19 pandemic engulfed the planet – see Photo 3.\n\nPhoto 3. Otto Lamminpää and Amy Braveman [both from JPL] in Finland. Photo credit: Otto Lamminpää\n\nOtto had never gone a week without seeing his family or skipped a berry-hunting party in the forests of his native Finland. With the forced distance, he placed himself in his home forests in his mind. He used this memory to marvel at the capacity of the vast forests to “breathe in” CO 2 and convert it into trunks, branches, and roots through photosynthesis. With the COVID-19-imposed travel restrictions, Otto wasn’t sure how long he’d have to wait to go back home.\n\nBut whenever that homecoming occurred, Otto knew that a piece of OCO-2 would be waiting for him. North of the Arctic Circle in Sodankylä, a cluster of Earth instruments nestled in a snowy meadow include a field station that is part of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) of Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS). These stations act as OCO-2 and OCO-3’s “ground crew.” As the satellites orbit Earth, the FTS simultaneously measures direct solar spectra in the near-infrared spectral region, which allows for retrieval of column-averaged CO 2 concentrations, as well as other key atmospheric constituents, over the snowy meadow. Back in the lab, Otto, along with other OCO-2 and OCO-3 scientists, compare the data collected at the field station to the satellite data. This feature was detailed in The Earth Observer article, titled “Integrating Carbon from the Ground Up: TCCON Turns Ten,” was published July–August 2014, Volume 26 issue 4, pp. 13–17).\n\nFigure 4. Global map of the ground stations, also known as the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). The red dots mark the active ground observation stations to validate OCO-2 and OCO-3 data. Figure credit: NASA-JPL/OCO-2\n\nThe station in Finland is one of about 30 similar TCCON sites scattered across the world, located in a variety of settings, from isolated tropical islands to the Pacific rim of Asia – see Figure 4. The stations in the far north play an especially valuable role since satellites often struggle to accurately measure CO 2 over snow-covered ground. Therefore, reliable measurements from the ground stations become crucial to adjust and improve the satellite data.\n\nValidation efforts such as the one described here are crucial to satellite observations. Comparisons between OCO-2 and TCCON show agreement is good, with a less than 1 ppm difference. It’s an impressive level of accuracy for a satellite orbiting more than 435 mi (700 km) away in polar orbit. The “ground truth” data collected at these field sites help to ensure that the satellite is accurately measuring “Earth’s breathing.”\n\nFor Otto, not just his family, but OCO-2 and OCO-3 itself was calling him home. As the pandemic began to ease, he returned to Finland to pick berries, jump in the sauna every night, and follow it up with snow angels. The homecoming was also coordinated with a trip past the Arctic Circle to the TCCON field station. The mission was part of him. Wherever he was, OCO-2 and OCO-3 would be there, too.\n\n2023: The Annual Science Team Meeting Continues\n\nTracking changes in soil moisture during a colorful fall day.\n\nSaswati Das [JPL—Postdoctoral Fellow] had missed the magnificent display of fall colors in deciduous forests of the East Coast of the United States. She’d seen nothing of the sort since moving to Los Angeles in 2022 to work on OCO-2. Before that, she’d been working on her Ph.D. at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), where the surrounding mountain peaks, meadows, and forests burned and sparked with crimson and gold in the autumn – see Photo 4. Now she was in another mountain town, Boulder, CO, to attend the OCO science team meeting. The aspens glittered like golden lanterns as her gang carpooled up the Flatiron Range to the science institute at Table Mesa.\n\nPhoto 4. Saswati Das takes a break from her Ph.D studies at nearby Virginia Tech (located in Blacksburg, VA) to enjoy the famous fall colors in the mountains of West Virginia. Photo credit: Saswati Das\n\nThe research presented that week spanned a variety of topics. OCO-2 was being used to develop early drought forecasts. Because of its ability to detect the SIF “glow” that results from plant photosynthesis, OCO-2 can hint at flash droughts as early as three months before environmental decay unfold. By pairing OCO-2 data from other satellites, such as soil moisture data from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, scientists have opened a new window into drought forecasts and how water supply affects plant growth.\n\nSurprises about our planet have also emerged. The tropical rainforests, long nicknamed the “lungs” of our planet, don’t always inhale and store carbon. At times, this region can exhale CO 2 , such as during the 2015–2016 El Niño. That period saw large tropical forests temporarily transform into net carbon sources – see Figure 5. The driver for this shift varied by region. The Amazon rainforest was driven by drought. Central Africa was driven by unusually high temperatures. Indonesia was driven by widespread fires.\n\nFigure 5. The 2015–2016 El Niño increased the net carbon dioxide released by Earth’s tropical regions into the atmosphere. Figure credit: NASA-JPL/Caltech\n\nData from OCO-2 and OCO-3 have also been used to study emissions from both cities and large power plants. This approach offers a new way to track changing emissions over time – without needing to continuously measure them on the ground. In addition, scientists are combining the satellite data with wind models and urban maps to trace CO 2 to its sources (e.g., factories, ships, and roadways), helping to disentangle emissions from overlapping city sectors. These methods have been used to isolate industrial emissions in places, such as Europe, China, as well as over cities, such as Los Angeles, Paris, and Seoul. It has also revealed pandemic-era drops in traffic-related CO 2 and increases in CO 2 tied to shipping backlogs at the port. Two representatives from the World Bank shared how they used data from OCO-2 to demonstrate that building subway systems in cities can lower emissions. The goal is to eventually use these tools to evaluate local strategies (e.g., bike lanes and public transit) to reduce local carbon footprints.\n\nWhen massive wildfires blazed through Australian forests and bushland in 2019, researchers used OCO-2 data to study the unfolding crisis. OCO-2 captured the increase in atmospheric CO 2 , and scientists used this data to refine estimates of how these events contribute to the global carbon budget.\n\nAs her mind wandered from the rich research she’d been immersed in for the past hour, Saswati spied Otto Lamminpää across the aisle in the wood-paneled auditorium. She thought back to the forests she loved on the East Coast, and the forests in Finland where Otto had grown up. OCO-2 was telling a story about the role that forests play in absorbing carbon and how this has changed over time.\n\n2025 and Beyond\n\nThe Tapestry Continues to Expand…\n\nIn many ways, OCO-2 has had a long and unexpected journey. So has Hannah Murphy, another DEVELOP intern who will be starting a Master’s degree at Hunter College in New York in Fall 2025. She’s studied art and worked as a set designer in Los Angeles. She never pictured herself working with satellite data, but then she saw how visual it could be. The glowing, evocative images of Earth from space spoke to her artistic heart.\n\nNow, Hannah works on SIF data as a 2025 NASA DEVELOP intern with the OCO-2 team, developing tools for wildfire risks. This project in particular hits close to home for Hannah, because she lived through the wildfires that tore through Los Angeles in January 2025. Although she remained safe, she knew several people who lost their homes, and the air was unsafe to breathe for weeks.\n\nJust a few short months later, Hannah began studying the data from OCO-2. She is now part of the new generation of researchers that will take the mission’s remote sensing data and pave the way for implementing the findings to benefit society. Hannah understands, on a personal level, how closely our lives are linked to Earth systems that satellites, such as OCO-2 and OCO-3, study from space.\n\nOCO-2 (and OCO-3) are built to study CO 2 and plant health, but its impact goes deeper to the connections that tie our atmosphere, ecosystems, and lives together. That work continues to the new generation of scientists – one breath at a time.\n\nMejs Hasan\n\nNASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nmejs.hasan@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nAlan Ward\n\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center/Global Science & Technology Inc.\n\nalan.b.ward@nasa.gov",

      "content": "Inside Australia's billion-dollar bid to take on China's rare earth dominance\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Suranjana Tewari Asia Business Correspondent in Eneabba Share Save\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Rare earths are essential in the production of alloys for magnets\n\nDrive three hours north of Perth, and you'll arrive in Eneabba - barren and desolate, just the odd hill in the distance. This is Western Australia mining territory. Buried in this vast terrain is a massive pit, full of what looks like mounds of worthless dirt. But appearances can be deceiving: this pit is home to a million-tonne stockpile containing critical minerals, better known as rare earths, which are crucial for making electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence equipment. And Australia is betting big on this discovery with a billion dollar loan to a mining company to extract these metals - and disrupt a supply chain that China has monopolised. Will the gamble pay off? China's chokehold on rare earths has hit home with US President Donald Trump's trade wars. When Beijing restricted exports, a powerful bargaining chip in tariff negotiations, it sent manufacturers around the world into their war rooms. China, they realised with alarm, had the power to stop their factories. Ford even halted production of its popular Explorer SUV for a week at one of its Chicago plants - a bold move while grappling with Trump's tariffs. A month later, CEO Jim Farley revealed the pause was triggered by a shortage of rare earths, admitting the company was still struggling to secure reliable supply. \"It's day to day,\" Mr Farley told Bloomberg TV. Beijing has since agreed to let rare earth minerals and magnets flow to the United States, which eased the bottleneck. But without a US-China trade deal, the fear is that the disruption could return. \"The West dropped the ball – that's the reality. And China was in for the long run. It saw the benefit and was willing to invest in it,\" says Jacques Eksteen, chair for extractive metallurgy at Curtin University.\n\nWhy rare earths matter\n\nThe phrase \"rare earths\" - referring to 17 elements on the periodic table which are lightweight, super strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in small electric motors - is something of a misnomer. \"Rare earths are not rare or scarce. Gold is scarce, but it's not a critical material,\" Professor Eksteen explains. Rare earths are critical, however. Take the average electric vehicle – there might be rare earths-based motors in dozens of components from side mirrors and speakers to windshield wipers and breaking sensors. The problem is therefore not amount, but the fact \"somewhere in the supply chain you've got one or maybe a few countries controlling that bottleneck\", Professor Eksteen adds. In the 90s, Europe and France in particular had a prominent rare earths industry. Today, almost all these minerals come from China, which has spent decades mining and refining at scale. China now accounts for more than half of global rare earth mining, and almost 90% of processing. The US sources 80% of its rare earth imports from China, while the European Union relies on China for about 98% of its supply. \"China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defence industries,\" says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company's vast Eneabba site. But Mr McGrath, and Iluka, are hoping to make a dent in that control - even if it wasn't necessarily in the company's original plan.\n\nIluka's 1mn tonne stockpile is worth more than $650m\n\nFor decades, Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper. It just so happens the byproducts of these mineral sands include dysprosium and terbium - some of the most sought-after rare earths. Over the years, Iluka has built up the stockpile, and is now worth more than $650m (£440m). This was the easy part, however. The processing or refining is another matter altogether. \"They're chemically very similar so to try and separate them requires a huge number of stages,\" Professor Eksteen explained. \"Also, you've got residues and wastes that you have to deal with out of this industry, and that's problematic. They often produce radioactive materials. It comes at a cost.\" And that is one of the reasons the Australian government is loaning Iluka A$1.65bn ($1bn; £798m) to build a refinery to meet demand for rare earths which Iluka sees growing by 50-170% by the end of the decade. \"We expect to be able to supply a significant proportion of Western demand for rare earths by 2030. Our customers recognise that having an independent, secure and sustainable supply chain outside of China is fundamental for the continuity of their business,\" says Mr McGrath. \"This refinery and Iluka's commitment to the rare earth business is an alternative to China.\"\n\nThe Australian government sees investment in rare earths as a strategic decision\n\nBut the refinery will take another two years to build and come online. \"Without the strategic partnership we have with the Australian government, a rare earths project would not be economically viable,\" Mr McGrath says.\n\nA strategic necessity\n\nChina's recent willingness to turn supply of rare earths on and off has spurred trading partners to diversify their suppliers. Iluka says because automakers for example plan their production years in advance, it is already fielding requests for when its refinery does come online. Rare earths are critical to the green transition, electric vehicles, and defence technologies – making their control a pressing national priority. \"The open international market in critical minerals and rare earths is a mirage. It doesn't exist. And the reason it doesn't exist is because there is one supplier of these materials and they have the wherewithal to change where the market goes, whether that be in pricing or supply,\" Australia's resources minister Madeleine King says. Canberra sees government intervention as necessary to provide an alternative supply, and help the world rely less on China. \"We can either sit back and do nothing about that... or we can step up to take on the responsibility to develop a rare earths industry here that competes with that market,\" Ms King adds. But there is something that Australia will have to contend with as it invests and works to expand a rare earths industry – pollution.\n\nGetty Images Critics say China's environmental protections and regulations are weak",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Rare earth minerals are key ingredients used in many products like electric cars, wind turbines, and defense tools. Most of these minerals come from China, which controls almost all the global supply and processing. This control worries many countries because it can cause shortages and price changes.\n\n**What happened** – Australia’s government is lending $1 billion to a mining company called Iluka Resources. Iluka has a huge stockpile of rare earth minerals in Western Australia and plans to build a new refinery to process these minerals. The refinery will help Australia produce its own rare earths and reduce dependence on China. The project is expected to be ready in about two years.\n\n**Impact** – This investment is important because it offers a new source of rare earths outside China. It helps countries like the US and those in Europe that rely heavily on Chinese minerals. Having more suppliers can prevent future shortages and make the supply chain more secure. It also supports green technology like electric vehicles and renewable energy, which need these minerals.\n\n**What’s next step** – Iluka will use the government loan to build the refinery and start processing rare earths. Meanwhile, companies that make electric cars and other products are already asking Iluka about future supplies. Australia will also need to manage environmental challenges linked to mining and refining these minerals.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Australia’s $1 billion plan to mine and refine rare earth minerals aims to break China’s monopoly and strengthen global supply for clean energy and technology.\n\n",

      "content": "An ancient wetland system of islands and canals that pre-dates the Aztecs endures quietly in Mexico City.\n\nThese wetlands, cradled within North America’s most populous city, are the only place on Earth where you can find one of the most recognizable — and endangered — creatures on the planet: the axolotl.\n\nNow, a new survey has confirmed what scientists and locals have feared: The charismatic salamander is nearing extinction in the wild, driven by habitat loss, pollution and the introduction of invasive fish that prey on it.\n\nLed by the Ecological Restoration Laboratory of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), with support from Conservation International-Mexico, the survey is the most comprehensive effort of its kind, covering 115 monitoring sites across the 2,500-hectare (6,180-acre) Xochimilco Protected Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its canals and farm islands, called chinampas.\n\nFor the first time, researchers used traditional fishing nets as well as environmental DNA (eDNA) to track the presence of the notoriously elusive amphibian.\n\nAlthough no axolotls were captured with the nets, eDNA testing, which captures traces of animals’ genetic material in water, soil or even air, revealed that axolotls are still present in the canals.\n\n© Susana Portillo\n\nResearchers used both traditional nets and eDNA during the survey. No axolotls were found using the nets.\n\nFurther reading: What on Earth is ‘eDNA’?\n\n“Unlike previous surveys, this time we included environmental DNA to better understand where axolotls are surviving and how their habitat is changing,” said Luis Zambrano, director of the UNAM lab and lead researcher on the census. “Habitat degradation is pushing axolotls to the brink of extinction. Their future and the health of Xochimilco depend on sustained investment in chinampa farming, local leadership, and a new approach to urban living that embraces nature.\"\n\nEDNA, extracted from water samples, revealed axolotls are still present in the canals. © Víctor Martínez\n\nWhile the results are far from a call for celebration, they may offer a glimmer of hope for the future of axolotls in Xochimilco’s wetlands — if restoration is prioritized.\n\nOnce abundant, axolotl populations are a flicker of what they used to be. In 1998, there were an estimated 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer. By 2014, the last time the survey was conducted, that number had dwindled to just 36 per square kilometer — a 99 percent decrease.\n\nAxolotls are extremely sensitive to changes in water quality, temperature, salinity and food. As Xochimilco’s wetlands have been battered by the overuse of pesticides in modern farming and invasive species like carp and tilapia — which are not only axolotls’ main predators, but also compete for food, shelter and breeding areas — axolotl’s numbers have followed course.\n\nIn response, local farmers and scientists have teamed up to reverse the trend.\n\n© Víctor Martínez\n\nA local farmer works on his chinampa.\n\n“We can’t save axolotls without restoring their habitat,” said Esther Quintero, a biologist at Conservation International-Mexico. “That means working hand in hand with the people who live and farm in these wetlands every day. Restoring Xochimilco is not just a scientific or ecological challenge — it’s a chance to rethink how we live in cities and make space for nature to thrive alongside us.”\n\nUsing a restoration model known as chinampa-refuge, developed by UNAM and local farmers, Conservation International is helping the farmers blend ancestral farming techniques like the farm islands with modern science, as well as supporting a new generation of farmers who are committed to protecting Xochimilco.\n\n© Isabel Taborga\n\nAn aerial view of the chinampas of Xochimilco\n\nThese chinampa-refuges are a sanctuary for axolotls. Biofilters, made from wood, gravel and native plants, clean the water and block invasive predators from entering the designated canals. As a result of the biofilters, water quality has improved, invasive species have declined, crop yields have increased, and native fish such as the Chapultepec splitfin and the Shortfin silverside have returned.\n\nTwenty-one chinampa-refuges currently dot Xochimilco’s wetlands, with more planned in the coming year. These farm islands, if scaled up, have the potential to produce up to a quarter of the flowers and vegetables purchased in Mexico City. And the wetland’s benefits extend beyond agriculture, helping to control flooding, regulate the city’s climate and buffer against extreme weather.\n\nIn September, a second, larger phase of the census will enable researchers to compare results with the 2014 census. In the meantime, Conservation International-Mexico, the researchers and farmers are focused on raising public awareness about the importance of Xochimilco — to axolotls and to Mexico City.\n\n“Finding traces of axolotls gives us hope to continue restoring their habitat — a task that must involve all of society,” Zambrano said.\n\n© Susana Portillo\n\nTo bring axolotls back, researchers say the entire ecosystem must be restored.\n\nMary Kate McCoy is a staff writer at Conservation International.

      "summary": "You might hear birds singing on some mornings, just bits of sound between car horns...\nThe post Guest Idea: How To Help Birds Navigate The Human World appeared first on Earth911.",
      "content": "You might hear birds singing on some mornings, just bits of sound between car horns and footfalls. Sparrows slice through bushes, robins shout from rooftops, and warblers slip through above before anyone even looks up. It sounds peaceful.\n\nBut for birds, cities are scary, dangerous places. We construct with glass, keep the lights on all night, and make noise that never ends. To us, it’s just life. But for them, it’s hard. And we don’t even see it most days.\n\nLife in the City Is Tough for Birds\n\nModern cities weren’t built with birds in mind. What looks normal to us —glass buildings, bright lights, and perfectly trimmed landscaping —can spell trouble for birds. Migrating birds frequently pass through cities. They are unaware of the dangers that all that glass represents. For a bird, a glass panel appears to be a place to fly. It’s a danger that comes with every window.\n\nBillions of them migrate across North America every spring and fall, and as many as a billion birds die annually in the United States due to human activity and buildings. When they take to the air over cities, many go astray. Bright lights confuse them. Reflections pull them in. And when they finally attempt to land, there’s no food and no safe place to go.\n\nGlass: The Invisible Killer\n\nRecently during an afternoon, I walked into my office to check my email when something unexpected occurred. A poor little bird slammed into the window beside me. It flew away a second later. I stayed still. I was reeling and trying to process what had just happened. But I kept thinking, the bird had it worse.\n\nI looked at the transparent window, then at the tree outside, and thought, “How could it have happened”? It looked like the bird was trying to fly right into the room. Perhaps it had been scared by something. Maybe the wind caught it. Or maybe it simply never saw the glass at all. I never realized how dangerous glass could be until I saw it myself. That moment changed everything and pushed me to find solutions.\n\nThat’s when I got moved to do something. You can do the same. One easy step, putting Xs on your windows, can help. Use opaque tape, large dots, or decals on the glass to warn away our feathered friends. Place them in patterns, closing any area more than two to four inches apart vertically or four to six inches horizontally to show birds that their way is blocked.\n\nEven something small, such as a few pieces of tape or a strip of bird-safe film, can make all the difference. It might be the one thing that could save a bird from harm. Other helpful options include insect screens or mesh, which reduce reflections and provide cushioning.\n\nLight Pollution Disorients Migrating Birds\n\nAnother challenge for birds is the impact of human-produced light. Birds use stars to navigate and have been doing this for millions of years, following the night sky as a guide across continents. Now our city lights wash out the stars and confuse them, pulling migrating birds off course.\n\nYou don’t need to do much to make a positive difference. Angle your outdoor lights downward to prevent them from polluting the sky with stray electrons, and opt for warm or amber-colored lighting that activates only when needed, using motion sensors or timers. At night, closing the curtains can keep migratory and local birds on course.\n\nYour actions matter most during migration, from March to May, and again from August through October. Birds need clear, dark skies to navigate. What you do at home may help them survive their annual journeys.\n\nCity Noise Hurts Birds\n\nThe bird world is a world of sound. Whether they’re in search of a mate, laying claim to their turf, or calling out a warning that danger is near, every chirp, trill, and call matters. But humans have rendered their world incredibly noisy. Human sounds, such as sirens, jackhammers, and car engines, drown out conversations that keep birds alive.\n\nImagine trying to have a critical conversation with someone standing next to you, a leaf blower in hand. We have done it to every bird that has tried to adapt to living with us in our cities. We have stolen their voices, drowning them out in the sound of our lives.\n\nYou can support birds by promoting quiet green spaces in your community and working to protect these areas. Plant thick shrubs or trees around your house that absorb sound while offering shelter. When you choose native plants, you also provide birds with new food supplies and the natural noise barriers they need.\n\nLandscaping Hazards\n\nOur pristine lawns starve birds. Those perfect lawns and artificial turf feed nothing. We plant decorative shrubs that look nice but provide zero food value to birds and animals. Then, we throw up mirrors and glass ornaments that reflecting sounds which to baffle and endanger their lives.\n\nYou don’t have to redesign the whole yard. Make a spot in a corner that is bird-friendly. Give them one corner of their world, where native plants are going to feed them. Plants like coneflower and milkweed attract insects that birds eat. Serviceberry is the first course. It’s good to leave some leaf piles, because birds will scratch through them, looking for bugs. Place a birdbath and regularly clean it, and stop using pesticides everywhere.\n\nRemove those reflective garden ornaments. Birds slam into them, mistaking them for flying toward the open sky. Our beautiful adornments are turning into death traps.\n\nSupport Urban Birds\n\nYou can begin helping birds now. Here is a selection of a few changes that work and that you can implement.\n\nYour windows can be marked with tape or decals. Cluster designs together so birds can see them.\n\nSwitch up your lights. Install amber bulbs or track lights with motion sensors. Close curtains after dark.\n\nDo a bird-friendly makeover for your yard—plant native flowers in a corner. Add a water dish. Skip using pesticides. Engage the family. Have children decorate windows with bird stickers and tally visitors.\n\nFind what works for you. Every little bit makes a difference in keeping birds safe.\n\nA Safer City Starts with Awareness\n\nBirds are the music, motion, and sometimes the magical malevolence of cities. But they can’t do it alone. They need clear skies, visible windows, and welcoming gardens.

Glass windows, bright lights, loud noises, and tidy lawns can confuse and harm them. Many birds migrate through cities and struggle to survive in these environments.\n\n**What happened** – The article explains how common city features like glass windows can cause birds to crash and get hurt. Bright city lights confuse migrating birds that use stars to navigate at night. Loud noises drown out bird calls, and neat lawns lack food and shelter. The writer shares easy actions people can take, such as putting tape or stickers on windows, using softer outdoor lighting, planting native flowers, and avoiding pesticides.\n\n**Impact** – These small changes can save many birds’ lives by preventing crashes and helping them find food and shelter. For example, placing decals on windows prevents birds from flying into invisible glass. Using amber lights helps birds stay on their migration paths. Planting native plants provides insects and berries that birds eat. Together, these steps help birds survive in cities where they are often at risk.\n\n**What’s next step** – People can start by marking windows and adjusting outdoor lights during bird migration seasons. Communities can encourage bird-friendly gardens and quiet green spaces. Families can get involved by planting native flowers and creating safe spots for birds.
