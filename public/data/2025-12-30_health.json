      "content": "BY THE OPTIMIST DAILY EDITORIAL TEAM\n\nIn a year marked by rapid change, scientific progress gave us reasons to wonder, dream, and keep pushing forward. For our Best of 2025 Science roundup, we’re celebrating the breakthroughs that didn’t just advance human knowledge; they sparked possibility, opened new frontiers, and reminded us why curiosity is a superpower.\n\nFor millions of people living with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), effective treatments can be elusive, and full recovery often feels out of reach. But a promising new therapy developed by researchers in Texas could be changing that narrative by targeting a nerve in the neck no bigger than a strand of spaghetti.\n\nThe therapy combines a tiny, button-sized device that stimulates the vagus nerve with a well-established psychological treatment called prolonged exposure therapy (PET). In a small Phase 1 trial, all nine participants were entirely symptom-free six months after treatment ended.\n\n“In a trial like this, some subjects usually do get better, but rarely do they lose their PTSD diagnosis,” said Dr. Michael Kilgard, a neuroscience professor at the University of Texas at Dallas and a co-author of the study published in Brain Stimulation. “In this case, we had 100 percent loss of diagnosis. It’s very promising.”\n\nHow it works: rewiring trauma with precision\n\nThe vagus nerve, the largest in the parasympathetic nervous system, helps regulate key automatic functions like heart rate, digestion, and mood. It’s long been a target for treating conditions like epilepsy and depression. Now, researchers are turning to it for PTSD.\n\nThe new treatment augments PET, a form of cognitive behavioral therapy where patients revisit traumatic memories in a controlled, safe space. PET works by gradually reshaping the brain’s fear response, but adding vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) appears to supercharge that process.\n\nVNS is believed to enhance synaptic plasticity, the brain’s ability to rewire itself. PET highlights which connections need change, while VNS provides a chemical nudge through neuromodulators like acetylcholine and norepinephrine. The combination, researchers say, helps the brain let go of fear responses more deeply and lastingly.\n\nSmall device, big impact\n\nIn the Phase 1 trial, participants received 12 VNS sessions alongside PET. The stimulator, fitted on the neck, delivered brief electrical impulses to the vagus nerve. Researchers followed up with participants four times over six months, and the results remained consistent: no PTSD symptoms.\n\nWhile larger studies are needed, this is an encouraging signal. “Typically, the majority will have this diagnosis for the rest of their lives,” said Dr. Kilgard. “To see complete loss of diagnosis in every participant is extraordinary.”\n\nThe team also engineered a new implantable version of the VNS device, about the size of a dime, which could make delivery even more precise and accessible in the future.\n\nA growing toolkit for trauma recovery\n\nThis nerve-based therapy joins a growing array of innovative treatments being explored for PTSD, including psychedelics, targeted exercise, mindfulness programs, and even cognitive games like Tetris. Each new tool offers hope for individuals who don’t respond to standard therapies.\n\nThe Texas research team is already advancing to a Phase 2 trial, expanding testing to participants in Dallas and Austin. Their hope is that this technique can become a viable option for those who haven’t found relief through traditional cognitive behavioral therapy alone.\n\nWith care, science, and a little electric spark, healing from trauma may be more within reach than ever before.\n\nSource study: Brain Stimulation— Vagus nerve stimulation therapy for treatment-resistant PTSD",

      "title": "MIT scientists find a way to rejuvenate the immune system as we age",
      "summary": "As the immune system weakens with age, scientists have found a way to restore some of its lost strength. By delivering mRNA to the liver, they created a temporary source of immune-boosting signals that normally come from the thymus. Older mice treated this way produced more effective T cells and responded far better to vaccines and cancer treatments. The strategy could one day help extend healthy years of life.",
      "content": "As people get older, the immune system often becomes less effective. Populations of T cells shrink, and the remaining cells may respond more slowly to germs. That slowdown can leave older adults more vulnerable to many kinds of infections.\n\nTo address this age related decline, scientists from MIT and the Broad Institute developed a method to temporarily reprogram liver cells in a way that strengthens T cell performance. The goal is to make up for the reduced output of the thymus, the organ where T cells normally mature.\n\nIn the study, the team used mRNA to deliver three important factors that support T cell survival. With this approach, they were able to rejuvenate the immune systems of mice. Older mice that received the treatment produced larger and more varied T cell populations after vaccination, and they also showed improved responses to cancer immunotherapy.\n\nThe researchers say that if this strategy can be adapted for patients, it could help people stay healthier as they age.\n\n\"If we can restore something essential like the immune system, hopefully we can help people stay free of disease for a longer span of their life,\" says Feng Zhang, the James and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at MIT, who has joint appointments in the departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Biological Engineering.\n\nZhang is also an investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, a core institute member at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and an investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He is the senior author of the new study. Former MIT postdoc Mirco Friedrich is the lead author of the paper, which was published in Nature.\n\nThe Thymus and Why T Cells Decline With Age\n\nThe thymus is a small organ located in front of the heart, and it is essential for building a healthy supply of T cells. Inside the thymus, immature T cells go through a checkpoint process that helps create a diverse set of T cells. The thymus also releases cytokines and growth factors that help T cells survive.\n\nBut beginning in early adulthood, the thymus starts to shrink. This process is called thymic involution, and it reduces the body's ability to produce new T cells. By about age 75, the thymus is essentially nonfunctional.\n\n\"As we get older, the immune system begins to decline. We wanted to think about how can we maintain this kind of immune protection for a longer period of time, and that's what led us to think about what we can do to boost immunity,\" Friedrich says.\n\nEarlier efforts to rejuvenate the immune system have often focused on sending T cell growth factors through the bloodstream, but that approach can cause harmful side effects. Other researchers are investigating whether transplanted stem cells could help regrow functional thymus tissue.\n\nA Temporary Liver Factory Powered by mRNA\n\nThe MIT team chose a different strategy. They asked whether the body could be prompted to create a temporary \"factory\" that produces the same T cell stimulating signals typically made by the thymus.\n\n\"Our approach is more of a synthetic approach,\" Zhang says. \"We're engineering the body to mimic thymic factor secretion.\"\n\nThey selected the liver for the job for several reasons. The liver can produce large amounts of protein even in old age. It is also easier to deliver mRNA to the liver than to many other organs. In addition, all circulating blood flows through the liver, including T cells, making it a practical place to release immune supporting signals into the bloodstream.\n\nTo build this factory, the researchers picked three immune cues involved in T cell maturation. They encoded these factors into mRNA and packaged the sequences into lipid nanoparticles. After injection into the bloodstream, the nanoparticles collect in the liver. Hepatocytes take up the mRNA and begin making the proteins encoded by it.\n\nThe three factors delivered were DLL1, FLT-3, and IL-7. These signals help immature progenitor T cells develop into fully differentiated T cells.\n\nVaccine and Cancer Immunotherapy Benefits in Older Mice\n\nExperiments in mice showed multiple positive outcomes. In one test, the researchers injected the mRNA particles into 18 month old mice, roughly comparable to humans in their 50s. Because mRNA does not last long in the body, the team gave repeated doses over four weeks to keep the liver producing the factors consistently.\n\nAfter the treatment, T cell populations increased substantially in both size and function.\n\nThe team then examined whether the approach improved vaccine responses. They vaccinated mice with ovalbumin, a protein found in egg whites that is often used to study immune reactions to a specific antigen. In 18 month old mice that received the mRNA treatment before vaccination, the number of cytotoxic T cells targeting ovalbumin doubled compared with untreated mice of the same age.\n\nThe researchers also found that the mRNA method could strengthen responses to cancer immunotherapy. They treated 18 month old mice with the mRNA, implanted tumors, and then gave the mice a checkpoint inhibitor drug. This drug targets PD-L1 and is intended to release the immune system's brakes so T cells can attack tumor cells more effectively.\n\nMice that received both the checkpoint inhibitor and the mRNA treatment had much higher survival rates and lived longer than mice that received the checkpoint inhibitor drug without the mRNA treatment.\n\nThe researchers determined that all three factors were required for the immune improvement. No single factor could reproduce the full effect. Next, the team plans to test the approach in additional animal models and search for other signaling factors that might further strengthen immune function. They also want to investigate how the treatment influences other immune cells, including B cells.\n\nOther authors of the paper include Julie Pham, Jiakun Tian, Hongyu Chen, Jiahao Huang, Niklas Kehl, Sophia Liu, Blake Lash, Fei Chen, Xiao Wang, and Rhiannon Macrae.\n\nThe research was funded in part by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the K. Lisa Yang Brain-Body Center at MIT, Broad Institute Programmable Therapeutics Gift Donors, the Pershing Square Foundation, the Phillips family, J. and P. Poitras, and an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship.",

      "content": "There is a state of relaxation that few of us spend much time in, but which comes with profound well-being benefits. With healthier ageing, reduced risk of disease and feeling more energised all on offer, here's how to get there\n\nSimbie Yau\n\nIt happens every new year. Party time is over, and it is time to brace yourself for the predictable onslaught of health advice. Most of it will involve doing more of something that you already know is good for you. More exercise. More cooking from scratch. More wholesome, mindful hobbies. It is no wonder so many of us fall off the wellness wagon before the month is out. No matter how sage the advice, who has the time and energy to do more of anything? If this sounds familiar, it might come as good news that scientists have come up with a more appealing alternative – one that still promises to increase your chances of staying healthy for longer, but involves doing less, not more.\n\nOr, more precisely, that involves perfecting the art of doing, physiologically speaking, as little as possible. This unusual, yet deeply effective, twist on the New Year’s resolution hinges on mastering a physiological state that many of us spend few of our waking hours in. It is called deep rest – a way of being in which signals between the body and brain align on one fundamental fact: that all is well and there is absolutely nothing to worry about.\n\nIn essence, it is the polar opposite of stress. Deep rest is a state where the body can take a break from fighting and fleeing, instead regrouping and catching up with some much-needed maintenance and repair. And while it might take some trial and error to find your personal off switch, the evidence is accumulating that the payoffs could be huge: healthier ageing, reduced risk of disease and more energy to spend on something other than maintaining an ambient panic response.\n\nAlexandra Crosswell is a psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who, along with a group of her colleagues, proposed the idea of deep rest in early 2024. She is aware the term may sound familiar to some. Andrew Huberman, a Stanford neuroscientist turned wellness influencer, has widely promoted what he calls “non-sleep deep rest” on his podcast and social media channels. But, says Crosswell, the two aren’t quite the same. “The difference between how we define deep rest and how Huberman describes non-sleep deep rest is that his is a relaxation practice and ours is a psycho-physiological state,” says Crosswell. “Deep rest is beyond relaxation – it’s a coordinated shift of the whole nervous, endocrine and immune system into an overall state of safety signalling.”\n\nStressing out\n\nIt is a truth, universally acknowledged, that if one thing could transform human health, it would be an antidote to stress. Problematic stress is a centuries-old issue that people have been complaining about since at least the industrial revolution. The things that generation struggled with – the cost of living, the pressures of work and family and an unsettling change in the pace of life – are still as relevant today as they were then. What’s new is that these very human concerns are layered on top of an underlying current of unease fuelled by 24-hour access to awareness of global crises, many of which seem frighteningly out of our control. There are signs that all of this is taking a serious toll.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to Eight Weeks to a Healthier You Your science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better. Sign up to newsletter\n\nAccording to a 2022 survey of over 3000 US adults, more than a quarter of respondents said stress made it difficult to function in daily life. Meanwhile, chronic stress has been linked to soaring rates of everything from depression and anxiety to cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, infectious diseases and some cancers. It is a major factor in the epidemic of tiredness and fatigue and is linked to accelerated ageing and an increased risk of all-cause mortality from middle age onwards. Yet despite an overwhelming consensus that too much stress is bad for our health, it has proved difficult to pin down exactly why, which has made it difficult to know how to go about fixing the problem. The big picture is clear enough and, arguably, pretty obvious.\n\n“ While a stress response is on the go, the body takes a break from less urgent processes like digestion, reproduction, maintenance and repair “\n\nStress is draining because, whether the threat is physical or psychological, mounting a stress response requires a huge investment of the body’s resources. In experiments, a short bout of psychological stress increased volunteers’ energy expenditure by up to 67 per cent above their resting metabolic rate. Other studies suggest that about a third of this energy is spent on fuelling the rise in heart rate, with the rest accounted for by the cost of producing stress hormones and inflammation. Once the stress hormones are circulating in the body, they have knock-on effects on the cell’s metabolism.\n\nThe stresses of modern life leave many of us feeling depleted Corbis via Getty Images\n\nHuman cells that are chronically exposed to stress hormones in the lab have been found to burn through energy 60 per cent faster, age faster and die younger. The whole process gobbles up so much energy that, while an active stress response is on the go, the body takes a break from less urgent processes like digestion, reproduction, maintenance and repair. The stress response is an example of a process called allostasis, or “stability through change”. Allostasis is different from the more familiar process of homeostasis, which describes how we regain balance after one or more biological processes have been knocked off course by environmental change.\n\nIn allostasis, though, the adjustments don’t happen after change, but in advance, based on the brain’s predictions about what is likely to happen next (like identifying a possible incoming threat) and how best to adapt (like by flooding your system with hormones as part of the fight or flight response.) “Your brain is predictively regulating your body,” says Lisa Feldman Barrett, a neuroscientist at Northeastern University in Boston. “Your body is [then] sending signals back to your brain about the sensory conditions of the body and the sensory consequences of allostasis.”\n\nHow the brain regulates the body\n\nRecently, a group of neuroscientists, including Feldman Barrett, have argued that allostasis isn’t just a side project for the brain; rather, it is its main function and number one priority. In this view, thinking, feeling and action all work in service of allostasis, helping the brain reach its goals by motivating us to do whatever is necessary to balance the books and stay alive. This new view of the brain puts a spin on the challenge of tackling the epidemic of stress, says Karen Quigley, also at Northeastern University, who, along with her colleague Feldman Barrett, proposed the idea in a 2025 paper in the journal Neuron.\n\n“If you start from the biology and try to understand this important and critical role for a brain managing its energy budget, then you start to think about concepts like stress slightly differently,” says Quigley. Thinking of toxic stress as allostasis gone awry helps explain why the expense of chronic or repeated stress takes its toll on our health. Allostatic states, like stress, are supposed to be temporary.\n\nIn short bursts, the investment is worthwhile when you need to run, fight or think your way out of a crisis. But given that most modern threats aren’t actually likely to lead to your demise, much of the time, the investment is metabolic overkill. And given that daily hassles are a part of life – a survey of US adults reported an average of three or more stressful events a day – there is often little time to recover before the next thing hits the fan. The result is tension, fatigue and an increased risk of poor health, as the body continues to sideline maintenance and repair in a misguided attempt to be ready for anything.\n\nYour internal ‘off switch’\n\nIronically, there is some evidence that constantly being in “a little bit on” state makes the body less efficient at responding to acute stress, so when we actually need our fight or flight system, it’s as worn out as we are. In better news, the fact that allostatic states are temporary by nature raises the possibility that if we can find the right bodily switch, we can change the signal, and the accompanying allostatic state, to one where all is well and biological bankruptcy isn’t an immediate concern.\n\n“It may be that you can create a ‘system reset’ partly by enhancing signals that current resources are sufficient,” says Quigley. This is where the idea of deep rest comes in. Crosswell and her colleagues set out to explore why contemplative practices like prayer, chanting, meditation, yoga and qigong (a practice involving flowing, coordinated movements) have positive effects on physical health and mental well-being, reducing self-reported levels of stress and improving markers of physical health such as blood pressure and inflammation.\n\nBringing together a team of researchers spanning neuroscience, physiology and cellular metabolism, the idea was to identify the special sauce in these practices. They concluded that the beneficial effects of contemplative practices come from the way they put a spanner in the physiology of the stress response. “These practices put the organism in a state of lower energy demand,” says Martin Picard, a mitochondrial psychobiologist at Columbia University who collaborated with Crosswell on the research. When the brain gets the memo, he says, it starts to be generous with its resources. “Instead of wasting your energy making cortisol and speeding up your heart rate, you have this energy pool that’s available for restoration,” he says. Studies suggest that contemplative practices do indeed reduce energy consumption.\n\nMindful practices like qigong can help you enter a state of deep rest VCG/VCG via Getty Images\n\nResearch dating back to the 1970s found that during transcendental meditation, metabolic rate dropped by 40 per cent compared with when the same volunteers were sitting quietly without meditating. Studies of regular yoga practitioners have also found that they consume up to 15 per cent less energy at rest than non-practitioners and have lower resting heart rate and blood pressure and lower levels of circulating stress hormones.\n\nAs to what exact mechanism is behind the effect, Crosswell and her colleagues speculate that one thing these interventions have in common is – by accident or design – that they tend to involve slow, deep breathing. Deep breathing, particularly at or around 6 breaths per minute, activates stretch-sensitive sensors in the chest, which activate parasympathetic activity in the vagus nerve (see “Breathing your way to deep rest“, below). The parasympathetic nervous system controls the so-called rest-and-digest response, which is the polar opposite of fight or flight. When parasympathetic activity is high, heart rate, blood pressure and other signs of arousal are low, and the body gets on with all the internal housekeeping that it has been keeping on hold.\n\n“ With prayer and mindfulness and other deep rest practices, you’re moving your mind away from worrying about the future into this present moment “\n\nThe shift to parasympathetic dominance, combined with the meditative element of these practices, might be enough to persuade the brain that there is no longer any threat, and to stand down, says Crosswell. “With prayer and mindfulness and other deep rest practices, you’re moving your mind away from worrying about the future into this present moment,” she says. Assuming that the here and now feels safe, this adds a second positive signal for the brain to factor into its budgeting – what Crosswell calls a “present moment sufficiency mindset” or “that right now, I have all the energy I need”.\n\nA woman rests in a flotation tank, another way of sinking into a state of profound rest nya Semenoff/The Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\nA 2025 study on using a mindfulness intervention seems to back up this idea that deep rest makes a measurable difference. Those who did 10 sessions of an hour-long mindful breathing and stretching-based practice had higher levels of healthy metabolic markers in the blood and lower levels of those associated with disease risk. A comparison group whose participants underwent relaxation training showed no such changes. This precise prescription wouldn’t work for everyone, however; for some, meditation might evoke a stress response, for example. Different options include paced breathing, particularly hitting those apparently crucial 6 breaths per minute, or simply spending time with a loved one who makes you feel safe.\n\nAs social creatures, our brains are wired to factor in how much support we have to deal with life’s ups and downs. Its power as an antidote to stress may even explain why close, supportive relationships are linked to better health and longer lifespan, says Quigley. “Humans are really critical allostatic supports for one another,” she says. “Social support is an important allostatic regulator.”\n\nSocial connection\n\nA good way to super-charge social support – or to mimic it if you don’t happen to have a loved one to hand – involves activating skin-based sensory nerves that are thought to have evolved to solidify social bonds. Known as C-tactile afferent fibres, these fire most enthusiastically when stroked slowly and gently at close to body temperature. Experiments into the effects of this “affective touch” have shown that it not only feels pleasant and calming to people of all ages, but it also leads to a drop in heart rate and other markers of parasympathetic activity, even when applied during a stressful experience. Research suggests that a soft-bristled brush stimulates these nerves almost as well as a loving caress from an actual human. A team of researchers at Cornell University in New York state are even trialling a wearable device that has shown promise in early tests as a stress-buster.\n\nBut the paramount message, says Crosswell, is that there is no single route to deep rest. Some people find meditation more stressful than calming, while others find affective touch ticklish or rage-inducing. What’s important is to seek out something that makes you feel warm, safe and calm from the inside. The ultimate state of deep rest, of course, is sleep, a time when the energy savings of being still and breathing more deeply allow the body to flush out the brain and make repairs to the body. It is possible that, for anyone short on sleep, adding deep rest to waking hours could help make up the shortfall.\n\nAs for how much you need to neutralise the effects of stress, the answer is: it varies. “I wish I could say how many minutes is enough,” says Crosswell. Even so, with growing evidence that deep rest is a state worth making time for, the best advice right now is to find where you feel safe and spend as much time in it as possible, basking in the knowledge that you are investing in your long-term health.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Many people feel tired and stressed because modern life often keeps us in a state of constant worry and alertness. This ongoing stress uses a lot of our body's energy and can harm our health over time.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers have studied a special state called deep rest, which is different from normal relaxation. Deep rest is when the body and brain send signals that everything is safe, allowing the body to slow down and repair itself. This state can be reached through practices like meditation, slow breathing, yoga, or spending time with supportive people.\n\n**Impact** – Deep rest helps the body save energy by lowering heart rate and stress hormones. This gives the body a chance to fix damage, reduce the risk of diseases, and slow down aging. Unlike other health advice that asks you to do more, deep rest asks you to do less, which can be easier for many people to manage.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists want to learn more about how to help people find their own ways to reach deep rest. This could include different relaxation methods or devices that mimic comforting touch. The goal is to make deep rest a regular part of daily life to improve long-term health.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Learning to enter a state of deep rest can reduce stress and protect your health by allowing your body to relax and repair itself.",
