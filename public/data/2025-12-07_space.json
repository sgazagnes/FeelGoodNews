      "title": "SPHERE’s stunning space images reveal where new planets are forming",
      "summary": "SPHERE’s detailed images of dusty rings around young stars offer a rare glimpse into the hidden machinery of planet formation. These bright arcs and faint clouds reveal where tiny planet-building bodies collide, break apart, and reshape their systems. Some disks contain sharp edges or unusual patterns that hint at massive planets still waiting to be seen, while others resemble early versions of our own asteroid belt or Kuiper belt. Together, the images form one of the most complete views yet of how newborn solar systems evolve and where undiscovered worlds may be hiding.",
      "content": "Using the SPHERE instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope, astronomers have created an extraordinary set of images showing debris disks in a wide range of exoplanetary systems. These dusty structures reveal where small bodies orbit their stars and provide rare insights into the earliest stages of planetary development. Gaël Chauvin (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy), project scientist for SPHERE and co-author of the study, explains: \"This data set is an astronomical treasure. It provides exceptional insights into the properties of debris disks, and allows for deductions of smaller bodies like asteroids and comets in these systems, which are impossible to observe directly.\"\n\nIn our own solar system, once you look past the Sun, the planets, and dwarf planets such as Pluto, an enormous variety of smaller (\"minor\") bodies comes into view. Scientists pay particular attention to objects ranging from about a kilometer to several hundred kilometers in size. Those that occasionally release gas and dust to form visible features like a tail are called comets, while those that do not show such activity are labeled asteroids.\n\nThese small bodies preserve clues to the solar system's earliest days. During the long process in which tiny grains grew into planets, intermediate objects known as planetesimals formed. Asteroids and comets are remnants of that transitional phase, planetesimals that never developed into full-size planets. In this sense, they are (somewhat) altered traces of the same ingredients that once built Earth.\n\nSearching for small bodies in exoplanetary systems\n\nAstronomers have identified more than 6000 exoplanets (that is, planets orbiting stars other than the Sun), giving us a clearer picture of how planetary systems vary throughout the galaxy. Directly imaging these worlds is still extremely difficult. Fewer than 100 exoplanets have been photographed so far, and even the largest ones appear only as featureless points of light.\n\nThis challenge becomes even greater when searching for small bodies. As Dr. Julien Milli, astronomer at the University Grenoble Alpes and co-author of the study, notes: \"Finding any direct clues about the small bodies in a distant planetary system from images seems downright impossible. The other indirect methods used to detect exoplanets are no help, either.\"\n\nDust provides the key to detecting hidden planetesimals\n\nThe breakthrough comes not from the small bodies themselves, but from the dust created when they collide. Young planetary systems are especially active. Planetesimals frequently crash into each other, sometimes merging into larger bodies and sometimes fragmenting into smaller ones. These events release vast amounts of fresh dust.\n\nThe physics behind dust visibility is surprisingly intuitive. Breaking an object into many tiny pieces preserves its total volume, but dramatically increases its surface area. For example, if a one kilometer wide asteroid were crushed into dust grains just one micrometer across (a millionth of a meter), the overall surface area would increase by a factor of one billion. More surface area means far more light reflected from the star, which makes the dust easier to detect. By observing that dust, astronomers can infer details about the unseen small bodies producing it.\n\nHow debris disks evolve over time\n\nDebris disks do not remain bright forever. As a young system matures, collisions become rarer. Dust can be pushed outward by radiation pressure from the central star, swept up by planets or planetesimals, or spiral inward and fall into the star.\n\nOur solar system provides a late-stage example. After billions of years, two major planetesimal belts remain: the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the Kuiper belt beyond the giant planets. A population of smaller dust grains also persists, creating zodiacal dust. Under especially dark skies, sunlight scattered by this dust can be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise as a faint glow called zodiacal light.\n\nFor observers studying our solar system from afar, these faint leftovers would be hard to detect. The new research, however, shows that similar dusty structures around younger systems should be visible for roughly the first 50 million years of a debris disk's lifetime. Capturing these images is extremely challenging. The task has been compared to photographing a thin cloud of cigarette smoke beside a blinding stadium floodlight from several kilometers away. SPHERE, which began operating on one of ESO's Very Large Telescopes (VLT) in spring 2014, was created specifically for such situations.\n\nHow SPHERE blocks starlight to reveal faint features\n\nThe fundamental idea behind SPHERE is familiar from everyday experience. If the Sun is shining directly into your eyes, you might raise a hand to shield the glare so you can see what lies around it. SPHERE uses a coronagraph to achieve the same effect when imaging exoplanets or debris disks. By inserting a small disk into the path of the star's light, the instrument blocks most of the glare before the image is captured. This method only works if the optical system remains extremely stable and precise.\n\nTo maintain this stability, SPHERE relies on a highly advanced version of adaptive optics. Turbulence in Earth's atmosphere distorts incoming starlight, and SPHERE continually monitors these distortions and corrects them in real time using a deformable mirror. An optional component can also isolate \"polarized light,\" which is characteristic of light reflected by dust rather than emitted directly from a star. This additional filtering enhances SPHERE's ability to detect faint debris disks.\n\nA major survey reveals 51 debris disks in sharp detail\n\nThe new study presents a unique set of debris disk images created by analyzing starlight scattered by tiny dust particles. \"To obtain this collection, we processed data from observations of 161 nearby young stars whose infrared emission strongly indicates the presence of a debris disk,\" says Natalia Engler (ETH Zurich), the lead author of the research. \"The resulting images show 51 debris disks with a variety of properties -- some smaller, some larger, some seen from the side and some nearly face-on -- and a considerable diversity of disk structures. Four of the disks had never been imaged before.\"\n\nWorking with such a large sample makes it possible to find broader patterns. The analysis revealed that more massive young stars tend to host more massive debris disks. Systems where dust is concentrated farther from the star also show a tendency toward more massive disks.\n\nRings, belts, and hints of unseen planets\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of the SPHERE results is the wide range of structures inside the disks. Many show rings or band-like patterns, with material clustered at specific distances from the star. This arrangement resembles our own solar system, where small bodies gather in the asteroid belt (asteroids) and the Kuiper belt (comets).\n\nThese structures are thought to be shaped by planets, especially large ones that clear out paths as they orbit. Some of the planets responsible have already been detected. In other cases, sharp edges or asymmetries in the disks strongly suggest the presence of planets that have not yet been directly observed. Because of this, the SPHERE survey provides a valuable set of targets for upcoming facilities. Instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) under construction by ESO should be capable of directly imaging at least some of the planets that are sculpting these dusty rings and gaps.\n\nStudy authors and publication details\n\nThe results described here have been published as Natalia Engler et al., \"Characterization of debris disks observed with SPHERE,\" in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nThe MPIA researchers involved are Gaël Chauvin, Thomas Henning, Samantha Brown, Matthias Samland, and Markus Feldt, in collaboration with Natalia Engler (ETH Zürich), Julien Milli (CNRS, IPAG, Université Grenoble Alpes), Nicole Pawellek (University of Vienna), Johan Olofsson (ESO), Anne-Lise Maire (CNRS, IPAG, Université Grenoble Alpes), and others.",

      "summary": "SQUIRE aims to detect exotic spin-dependent interactions using quantum sensors deployed in space, where speed and environmental conditions vastly improve sensitivity. Orbiting sensors tap into Earth’s enormous natural polarized spin source and benefit from low-noise periodic signal modulation. A robust prototype with advanced noise suppression and radiation-hardened engineering now meets the requirements for space operation. The long-term goal is a powerful space-ground network capable of exploring dark matter and other beyond-Standard-Model phenomena.",
      "content": "By placing ultra-sensitive quantum spin sensors in orbit, SQUIRE gains orders-of-magnitude improvements in detecting exotic physics signals.\n\nThis approach lays the groundwork for a global and interplanetary sensing system that could reveal hidden particles and forces.\n\nUnderstanding SQUIRE and Its Space-Based Quantum Strategy\n\nExotic-boson-mediated interactions fall into 16 categories. Of these, 15 depend on particle spin and 10 depend on relative velocity. These interactions can produce small shifts in atomic energy levels, and quantum spin sensors detect those shifts as pseudomagnetic fields. The SQUIRE mission intends to place such sensors on space platforms, including the China Space Station, to look for pseudomagnetic fields generated by exotic interactions between the sensors and Earth's geoelectrons. By combining space access with quantum precision tools, SQUIRE avoids a major limitation of ground experiments, which struggle to increase both relative velocity and the total number of polarized spins at the same time.\n\nWhy Low Earth Orbit Greatly Improves Sensitivity\n\nSeveral features of the orbital environment provide strong advantages.\n\nThe China Space Station travels in low Earth orbit at 7.67 km/s relative to Earth, nearly the first cosmic velocity and about 400 times faster than typical moving sources used in laboratory tests. Earth acts as an enormous natural source of polarized spins. Unpaired geoelectrons within the mantle and crust, aligned by the geomagnetic field, supply roughly 1042 polarized electrons, exceeding the capabilities of SmCo 5 laboratory spin sources by approximately 1017. Orbital motion turns exotic interaction signatures into periodic signals. For the China Space Station (orbital period ~1.5 hours), this produces modulation near 0.189 mHz, a region with lower intrinsic noise than DC measurement bands.\n\nProjected Performance Gains in Orbit\n\nWith these space-enabled benefits, the SQUIRE concept allows exotic field amplitudes to reach up to 20 pT even under strict current limits on coupling constants. This is dramatically higher than the best terrestrial detection threshold of 0.015 pT. For velocity-dependent interactions with force ranges >10⁶ m, the projected sensitivity improves by 6 to 7 orders of magnitude.\n\nBuilding a Space-Ready Quantum Spin Sensor\n\nDeveloping the prototype quantum sensor is essential for putting SQUIRE into operation. The instrument must remain extremely sensitive and stable over long periods while operating in a challenging orbital environment. In space, spin sensors encounter three dominant sources of interference: variations in the geomagnetic field, mechanical vibrations of the spacecraft, and cosmic radiation.\n\nReducing Noise and Increasing Stability\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the SQUIRE team created a prototype using three major innovations.\n\nDual Noble-Gas Spin Sensor: The device uses 129Xe and 131Xe isotopes with opposite gyromagnetic ratios, which allows it to cancel shared magnetic noise while remaining responsive to SSVI signals. This approach provides 104-fold noise suppression. With multilayer magnetic shielding, geomagnetic disturbances fall to the sub-femtotesla level. Vibration Compensation Technology: A fiber-optic gyroscope tracks spacecraft vibrations and enables active correction, bringing vibration noise to roughly 0.65 fT. Radiation-Hardened Architecture: A 0.5 cm aluminum enclosure and triple modular redundancy in its control electronics protect the system from cosmic rays. The design can continue functioning even if two of the three modules fail, reducing radiation-related interruptions to fewer than one per day.\n\nOn-Orbit Sensitivity and Scientific Readiness\n\nBy combining these technologies, the prototype achieves a single-shot sensitivity of 4.3 fT @ 1165 s, which is well matched to detecting SSVI signals that follow the 1.5-hour orbital period. This capability establishes a strong technological basis for precision dark matter searches conducted directly in orbit.\n\nExpanding Toward a Space-Ground Quantum Sensing Network\n\nQuantum spin sensors aboard the China Space Station can do far more than search for exotic interactions. SQUIRE proposes a \"space-ground integrated\" quantum sensing network that links orbital detectors with those on Earth, enabling far greater sensitivity across many dark matter models and other beyond-Standard-Model possibilities. These include additional exotic interactions, Axion halos, and CPT violation studies.\n\nFuture Opportunities Across the Solar System\n\nThe high-speed motion of orbiting sensors increases the coupling between axion halos and nucleon spins, producing a tenfold sensitivity improvement compared with Earth-based dark matter searches. As China expands deeper into the solar system, the SQUIRE approach may eventually employ distant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn (e.g., planets rich in polarized particles) as large natural spin sources. This long-term vision opens the door to exploring physics across much broader cosmic scales.",
