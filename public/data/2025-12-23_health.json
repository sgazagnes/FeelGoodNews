      "summary": "New research suggests Alzheimer’s may start far earlier than previously thought, driven by a hidden toxic protein in the brain. Scientists found that an experimental drug, NU-9, blocks this early damage in mice and reduces inflammation linked to disease progression. The treatment was given before symptoms appeared, targeting the disease at its earliest stage. Researchers say this approach could reshape how Alzheimer’s is prevented and treated.",
      "content": "An experimental drug developed at Northwestern University has demonstrated further promise as an early intervention for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a new study, Northwestern scientists identified a previously unknown highly toxic sub-species of amyloid beta oligomers -- toxic clusters of peptides -- that appear to drive several of the brain's earliest changes, including neuronal dysfunction, inflammation and activation of immune cells.\n\nThe experimental drug, a small-molecule compound called NU-9, decreased this toxic amyloid beta oligomersubtype and dramatically reduced the damage it causes in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. By addressing these changes at the onset of Alzheimer's disease, the researchers are hopeful NU-9 potentially could prevent, or significantly delay, the cascade of toxic events that ultimately destroy neurons.\n\nThe findings point to a potential new strategy for targeting the disease in its earliest stages -- before cognitive decline and other debilitating symptoms take hold.\n\nThe study will be published on Dec. 18 in Alzheimer's and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.\n\n\"Alzheimer's disease begins decades before its symptoms appear, with early events like toxic amyloid beta oligomers accumulating inside neurons and glial cells becoming reactive long before memory loss is apparent,\" said Northwestern's Daniel Kranz, the study's first author. \"By the time symptoms emerge, the underlying pathology is already advanced. This is likely a major reason many clinical trials have failed. They start far too late. In our study, we administered NU-9 before symptom onset, modeling this early, pre-symptomatic window.\"\n\nKranz is a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences (IBiS) program at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, where he is advised by corresponding author William Klein. An expert on Alzheimer's disease, Klein is a professor of neurobiology at Weinberg and a cofounder of Acumen Pharmaceuticals, which has developed a therapeutic monoclonal antibody currently in clinical trials that targets the subtype of amyloid beta oligomers identified in the study. Richard Silverman, a key co-author of the study, invented NU-9. Silverman, who previously invented pregabalin (Lyrica) to treat fibromyalgia, nerve pain and epilepsy, is the Patrick G. Ryan/Aon Professor in Weinberg's Department of Chemistry and founder of Akava Therapeutics, a startup company commercializing NU-9 (now called AKV9).\n\nThe promise of NU-9\n\nConceived about 15 years ago, NU-9 emerged as part of Silverman's multi-year effort to discover a small molecule compound that could prevent toxic protein aggregate buildup in neurodegenerative diseases. By 2021, NU-9 demonstrated efficacy in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), clearing toxic SOD1 and TDP-43 proteins and restoring health to upper motor neurons. In 2024, it received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin human clinical trials for ALS.\n\nEarlier this year, Silverman, Klein and Kranz demonstrated that NU-9 also could effectively treat Alzheimer's disease. In the previous study, NU-9 showed it could clear toxic amyloid beta oligomers in lab-grown brain cells from the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory.\n\n\"In both ALS and Alzheimer's disease, cells suffer from toxic protein buildup,\" Klein said. \"Cells have a mechanism to get rid of these proteins, but it gets damaged in degenerative diseases like ALS and Alzheimer's. NU-9 is rescuing the pathway that saves the cell.\"\n\nEarly intervention\n\nTo further investigate the drug's potential in treating Alzheimer's disease, the team wanted to evaluate its effectiveness at halting the earliest damage. In the new study, the researchers administered NU-9 to a pre-symptomatic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The mice received a daily oral dose for 60 days.\n\nThe results were striking. NU-9 significantly reduced early reactive astrogliosis, an inflammatory reaction that typically begins long before symptoms appear. The number of toxic amyloid beta oligomers bound to astrocytes (star-shaped brain cells that protect neurons and control inflammation) also plummeted. And an abnormal form of the protein TDP-43 -- a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases that is linked to cognitive impairments -- sharply decreased.\n\n\"These results are stunning,\" Klein said. \"NU-9 had an outstanding effect on reactive astrogliosis, which is the essence of neuroinflammation and linked to the early stage of the disease.\"\n\nThe improvements spanned multiple regions of the brain, indicating that NU-9 has a brain-wide anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nA hidden culprit\n\nWhile investigating the effects of NU-9 on the pre-symptomatic mouse model, the research team found an unexpected culprit. For decades, scientists have considered amyloid beta oligomers as more toxic than the larger amyloid beta fibrils that form plaques, which appear later in Alzheimer's disease. But not all amyloid beta oligomers are the same. The Northwestern scientists discovered one uniquely problematic subtype.\n\n\"We identified a distinct amyloid beta oligomer subtype that appears inside neurons and on nearby reactive astrocytes very early in the disease,\" Kranz said. \"It potentially acts as an instigator of early Alzheimer's pathology.\"\n\nCalled ACU193+ because it is detected by the antibody ACU193, the subtype shows up early inside of stressed neurons, the scientists found. Then, these oligomers appear to migrate to the surfaces of nearby astrocytes. When ACU193+ oligomers latch onto astrocytes, they may spark a cascade of inflammation that spreads throughout the brain, long before memory loss begins.\n\nA potential prophylaxis\n\nNU-9 targeted and dramatically reduced this subtype, suggesting the drug may be especially valuable at Alzheimer's earliest stages, when intervention is most effective. By reducing this subtype, NU-9 potentially could prevent the activation of astrocytes.\n\nAlthough they serve as the brain's frontline responders, astrocytes become destructive when pushed into a reactive state. This destructive behavior damages synapses, releases inflammatory molecules and accelerates neurodegeneration. Stopping this process might be one of the most powerful ways to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nKranz and Silverman likened the strategy to early intervention approaches for preventing cancer and heart disease.\n\n\"Most people are used to monitoring their cholesterol levels,\" Silverman said. \"If you have high cholesterol, it doesn't mean that you will have a heart attack soon. But it's time to take drugs to lower your cholesterol levels to prevent that heart attack from happening down the road. NU-9 could play a similar role. If someone has a biomarker signaling Alzheimer's disease, then they could start taking NU-9 before symptoms appear.\"\n\n\"There are a couple early diagnostic blood tests for Alzheimer's disease in development,\" Klein added. \"The promise of better early diagnostics -- combined with a drug that could stop the disease in its tracks -- is the goal.\"\n\nCurrently, the team is testing NU-9 in additional models of Alzheimer's disease, including an animal model of late-onset disease that better reflects typical human aging. The researchers also plan to follow animals for a longer period of time to determine whether symptoms develop in treated animals and plan to examine how early intervention with NU-9 affects memory and neuron health over time.\n\nThe study, \"Identification of a glia-associated amyloid beta oligomer subtype and the rescue from reactive astrogliosis by inhibitor NU-9,\" was supported by the National Institute of Health (grant AG061708).",

      "summary": "MIT scientists have achieved the first-ever lab synthesis of verticillin A, a complex fungal compound discovered in 1970. Its delicate structure stalled chemists for decades, despite differing from related molecules by only two atoms. With the synthesis finally complete, researchers created new variants that showed strong activity against a rare pediatric brain cancer. The breakthrough could unlock an entire class of previously unreachable cancer-fighting molecules.",
      "content": "MIT chemists have produced verticillin A in the lab for the first time. This fungal molecule was identified more than 50 years ago and has drawn attention for its potential as an anticancer agent.\n\nVerticillin A is notoriously hard to build because of its intricate chemical architecture. Even compared with closely related compounds, it proved far more challenging to synthesize, despite differing by only a couple of atoms.\n\n\"We have a much better appreciation for how those subtle structural changes can significantly increase the synthetic challenge,\" says Mohammad Movassaghi, an MIT professor of chemistry. \"Now we have the technology where we can not only access them for the first time, more than 50 years after they were isolated, but also we can make many designed variants, which can enable further detailed studies.\"\n\nIn lab tests using human cancer cells, one verticillin A derivative stood out against a pediatric brain cancer known as diffuse midline glioma. The researchers emphasize that additional testing is needed to assess whether it could eventually be useful in the clinic.\n\nMovassaghi and Jun Qi, an associate professor of medicine at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and Harvard Medical School, are the senior authors of the study, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Walker Knauss PhD '24 is the paper's lead author. Xiuqi Wang, a medicinal chemist and chemical biologist at Dana-Farber, and Mariella Filbin, research director in the Pediatric Neurology-Oncology Program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, are also authors.\n\nWhy This Fungal Molecule Was So Hard to Make\n\nResearchers first reported isolating verticillin A from fungi in 1970. Fungi use the compound to help defend themselves from pathogens. Verticillin A and similar fungal molecules have been explored for possible anticancer and antimicrobial activity, but their complexity has made them difficult to synthesize.\n\nIn 2009, Movassaghi's lab reported the synthesis of (+)-11,11'-dideoxyverticillin A, a compound closely related to verticillin A. That molecule contains 10 rings and eight stereogenic centers, meaning carbon atoms that each connect to four different chemical groups. Those groups must be positioned with the correct orientation, or stereochemistry, relative to the rest of the molecule.\n\nEven after that earlier success, verticillin A itself remained out of reach. The key difference between verticillin A and (+)-11,11'-dideoxyverticillin A is two oxygen atoms, but those additions made a major difference in how the molecule behaves during synthesis.\n\n\"Those two oxygens greatly limit the window of opportunity that you have in terms of doing chemical transformations,\" Movassaghi says. \"It makes the compound so much more fragile, so much more sensitive, so that even though we had had years of methodological advances, the compound continued to pose a challenge for us.\"\n\nRethinking the Chemistry Step by Step\n\nBoth versions of the verticillin molecule are built from two identical halves that must be connected into a structure called a dimer. In the earlier synthesis of (+)-11,11'-dideoxyverticillin A, the team carried out the dimerization near the end of the process and then formed four crucial carbon-sulfur bonds.\n\nWhen they tried to apply that same sequencing to verticillin A, it did not work. Adding the carbon-sulfur bonds late in the process failed to deliver the correct stereochemistry, forcing the team to redesign the entire order of steps.\n\n\"What we learned was the timing of the events is absolutely critical. We had to significantly change the order of the bond-forming events,\" Movassaghi says.\n\nThe new synthesis starts from an amino acid derivative called beta-hydroxytryptophan. From there, the researchers build the structure in stages, adding chemical functional groups, including alcohols, ketones, and amides, while carefully controlling stereochemistry at each step.\n\nTo guide that control, the team introduced a group containing two carbon-sulfur bonds and a disulfide bond early in the process. Because disulfides are sensitive, they had to be \"masked\" by converting them into a protected pair of sulfides so the structure would not break down during later reactions. After dimerization, the disulfide-containing groups were restored.\n\n\"This particular dimerization really stands out in terms of the complexity of the substrates that we're bringing together, which have such a dense array of functional groups and stereochemistry,\" Movassaghi says.\n\nIn total, the route takes 16 steps from the beta-hydroxytryptophan starting material to reach verticillin A.\n\nEarly Tests Against Diffuse Midline Glioma\n\nWith verticillin A finally accessible, the researchers could also adjust the approach to create derivates. A Dana-Farber team tested these molecules against several types of diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a rare brain tumor with limited treatment options.\n\nThe strongest effects appeared in DMG cell lines that produce high levels of a protein called EZHIP. EZHIP influences DNA methylation and has previously been flagged as a potential drug target for DMG.\n\n\"Identifying the potential targets of these compounds will play a critical role in further understanding their mechanism of action, and more importantly, will help optimize the compounds from the Movassaghi lab to be more target specific for novel therapy development,\" Qi says.\n\nThe verticillin derivatives seem to affect EZHIP in a way that increases DNA methylation, which pushes the cancer cells into programmed cell death. The most effective molecules in these experiments were N-sulfonylated (+)-11,11'-dideoxyverticillin A and N-sulfonylated verticillin A. N-sulfonylation -- the addition of a functional group containing sulfur and oxygen -- improves molecular stability.\n\n\"The natural product itself is not the most potent, but it's the natural product synthesis that brought us to a point where we can make these derivatives and study them,\" Movassaghi says.\n\nNext, the Dana-Farber researchers plan to further confirm how the verticillin derivatives work, and they hope to test the compounds in animal models of pediatric brain cancers.\n\n\"Natural compounds have been valuable resources for drug discovery, and we will fully evaluate the therapeutic potential of these molecules by integrating our expertise in chemistry, chemical biology, cancer biology, and patient care. We have also profiled our lead molecules in more than 800 cancer cell lines, and will be able to understand their functions more broadly in other cancers,\" Qi says.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the Ependymoma Research Foundation, and the Curing Kids Cancer Foundation.",

Despite its widespread use, there had been little scientific research confirming whether these benefits were real or whether the plant was safe.\n\nIdentifying Active Compounds and Testing Anti Inflammatory Effects\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, began with a detailed chemical analysis of the plant. Researchers examined the ethanolic extract made from the plant's aerial parts to determine which bioactive compounds it contained. This phase of the work was led by Marcos Salvador, a pharmacist from the Institute of Biology (IB) at UNICAMP.\n\nAfter identifying the compounds, the research moved to biological testing. A team led by pharmacologist Cândida Kassuya from the Faculty of Health Sciences at UFGD evaluated how well the extract reduced inflammation in experimental models of arthritis. Toxicological testing followed to assess safety. \"Finally, we performed the toxicological analyses under my coordination,\" explains Arielle Cristina Arena, associate professor in the Department of Structural and Functional Biology at the Institute of Biosciences at UNESP's Botucatu Campus.\n\nLaboratory Results Show Reduced Inflammation and Joint Damage\n\nThe experiments revealed that the ethanolic extract of A. littoralis significantly lowered inflammation in laboratory animals. \"In the experimental models, we observed reduced edema, improved joint parameters, and modulation of inflammatory mediators, suggesting antioxidant and tissue-protective actions,\" says Arena.\n\nThese findings indicate that the plant does more than reduce swelling. The results also suggest that it may help protect joint tissue and limit damage associated with inflammatory conditions like arthritis.\n\nPromising Safety Profile With Limits on Immediate Use\n\nAccording to Arena, the results strengthen the scientific case for the plant's medicinal value and provide a foundation for future preclinical studies. The findings also point to a favorable safety profile at therapeutic doses, which could be encouraging for eventual human use.\n\nHowever, the researchers caution that the extract is not ready for clinical application. Additional toxicological testing, human clinical trials, and standardized preparation methods are still required to confirm safety, effectiveness, and quality. Regulatory approval would also be necessary before any therapeutic use.\n\nSupporting Biodiversity Through Science\n\n\"This research is part of an ongoing line of investigation developed by UFGD, UNESP, and UNICAMP, and our purpose is to value Brazilian biodiversity and traditional knowledge, but with a rigorous scientific basis, promoting the safe and rational use of natural products,\" says Arena.\n\nThe research received funding from FAPESP (projects 06/06079-4, 09/05992-6, 15/03726-8, 16/06407-3, 17/19523-4, and 21/09693-5).",

      "title": "Why one long walk may be better than many short ones",
      "summary": "How you walk may matter just as much as how much you walk. A large UK study tracking more than 33,000 low-activity adults found that people who grouped their daily steps into longer, uninterrupted walks had dramatically lower risks of early death and heart disease than those who moved in short, scattered bursts.",
      "content": "A large population-based study examined whether the way people accumulate their daily steps affects their long-term health, regardless of how many total steps they take. The research focused on adults who were not highly active, defined as walking fewer than 8,000 steps per day (<8,000 steps per day). The findings showed a clear pattern: people who walked in longer, uninterrupted sessions faced lower risks of death from any cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with those whose steps were spread out in short bursts. The study was published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe analysis included 33,560 adults from the UK Biobank who averaged 8000 or fewer daily steps. Researchers grouped participants based on how long their typical walking sessions lasted. These categories included bouts shorter than 5 minutes, 5 to shorter than 10 minutes, 10 to shorter than 15 minutes, and 15 minutes or longer.\n\nParticipants walked a median of 5,165 steps per day. Nearly half of them, 42.9%, accumulated most of their steps in sessions lasting under 5 minutes. Another 33.5% primarily walked in 5- to 10-minute bouts, while 15.5% did most of their walking in 10- to 15-minute sessions. Only 8.0% regularly walked in sessions lasting at least 15 minutes.\n\nMortality Risk Drops as Walking Sessions Get Longer\n\nOver a follow-up period of 9.5 years, the risk of death decreased steadily as walking sessions became longer. Participants who took most of their steps in bouts shorter than 5 minutes had an all-cause mortality risk of 4.36% (95% CI, 3.52% to 5.19%). That risk dropped to 1.83% (CI, 1.29% to 2.36%) among those walking in 5- to 10-minute bouts.\n\nEven lower risks were seen in people who walked longer at a time. Those whose steps mainly came from 10- to 15-minute sessions had a mortality risk of 0.84% (CI, 0.13% to 1.53%), while participants who regularly walked for 15 minutes or more at a stretch had a risk of 0.80% (CI, 0.00% to 1.89%).\n\nHeart Disease Risk Shows an Even Stronger Pattern\n\nThe connection between walking patterns and cardiovascular disease was even more pronounced. After 9.5 years, participants who mostly walked in sessions shorter than 5 minutes had a cumulative CVD risk of 13.03% (CI, 11.92% to 14.14%). Those who walked in 5- to 10-minute bouts had a lower risk of 11.09% (CI, 9.88% to 12.29%).\n\nRisk continued to decline with longer walking sessions. Participants in the 10- to 15-minute group had a CVD risk of 7.71% (CI, 5.67% to 9.70%), while those walking in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest risk at 4.39% (CI, 1.89% to 6.83%).\n\nBigger Benefits for the Most Sedentary Adults\n\nAmong participants who were especially inactive, defined as taking fewer than 5,000 steps per day (<5,000 steps per day), the advantages of longer walking sessions were even more noticeable. In this group, walking for longer periods at a time was strongly associated with lower risks of both death and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThese findings suggest that for people who are otherwise sedentary or low-active, focusing on longer, more intentional walking sessions could be an effective way to improve health outcomes, even without increasing total step counts.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists wanted to understand if the way people walk during the day affects their health, especially for adults who don’t walk much. They studied people who walked fewer than 8,000 steps a day to see if longer walks help more than many short walks.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers in the UK followed over 33,000 adults for about 9.5 years. They grouped people by how long their walking sessions lasted: less than 5 minutes, 5 to under 10 minutes, 10 to under 15 minutes, and 15 minutes or more. Most people walked in short bursts, but some walked longer at a time.\n\n**Impact** – The study found that people who walked in longer, uninterrupted sessions had much lower chances of dying early or getting heart disease. For example, those who walked 15 minutes or more at once had less than half the risk of heart disease compared to those who only took short walks under 5 minutes. This was even clearer for people who walked very little overall.\n\n**What’s next step** – This research suggests that doctors and health programs might encourage people, especially those who don’t move much, to take longer walks instead of many short ones. Future studies may explore how to help people build longer walking habits and if these benefits apply to other groups.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Taking longer walks at a time lowers the risk of early death and heart disease more than many short walks, especially for people who usually walk very little.",
