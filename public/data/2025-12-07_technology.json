The approach works at low voltages and surpasses competing technologies in spectral precision. Early results suggest huge potential for future optoelectronic devices.",
      "content": "Scientists have unveiled a technique that uses 'molecular antennas' to direct electrical energy into insulating nanoparticles. This approach creates a new family of ultra-pure near-infrared LEDs that could be used in medical diagnostics, optical communication systems, and sensitive detectors.\n\nResearchers at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge have discovered how to drive electrical current into materials that normally do not conduct, a feat previously thought impossible under normal conditions. By attaching carefully chosen organic molecules that act like tiny antennas, they have built the first light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from insulating nanoparticles. Their work, reported in Nature, points toward a new generation of devices for deep-tissue biomedical imaging and high-speed data transmission.\n\nThe team focused on lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNPs), a well-known class of materials prized for producing light that is extremely pure and stable. These nanoparticles are especially effective in the second near-infrared region, which is able to penetrate deep into biological tissue. Until now, however, their electrically insulating character meant they could not be integrated into standard electronic components such as LEDs.\n\n\"These nanoparticles are fantastic light emitters, but we couldn't power them with electricity. It was a major barrier preventing their use in everyday technology,\" said Professor Akshay Rao, who led the research at the Cavendish Laboratory. \"We've essentially found a back door to power them. The organic molecules act like antennas, catching charge carriers and then 'whispering' it to the nanoparticle through a special triplet energy transfer process, which is surprisingly efficient.\"\n\nOrganic-Inorganic Hybrid Design With Molecular Antennas\n\nTo overcome the insulation problem, the researchers created an organic-inorganic hybrid structure. They attached an organic dye with a functional group anchor, called 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9-ACA), to the surface of the LnNPs. In the new LEDs, electrical charges are injected into these 9-ACA molecules, which act as a molecular antenna, rather than into the nanoparticles directly.\n\nOnce energized, the 9-ACA molecules enter an excited triplet state. In many optical systems this triplet state is considered \"dark,\" meaning that its energy is often lost instead of converted into useful light. In this design, however, the energy from the triplet state is transferred with more than 98% efficiency to the lanthanide ions inside the insulating nanoparticles, causing them to emit light with remarkable brightness.\n\nUltra-Pure Near-Infrared Light at Low Voltage\n\nUsing this method, the team's \"LnLEDs\" can be switched on with a relatively low operating voltage of about 5 volts. At the same time, they generate electroluminescence with an extremely narrow spectral width. This makes the emission much purer than that of many competing technologies, including quantum dots (QDs).\n\n\"The purity of the light in the second near-infrared window emitted by our LnLEDs is a huge advantage,\" said Dr. Zhongzheng Yu, a lead author of the study and postdoctoral research associate at the Cavendish Laboratory. \"For applications like biomedical sensing or optical communications, you want a very sharp, specific wavelength. Our devices achieve this effortlessly, something that is very difficult to do with other materials.\"\n\nBiomedical Imaging, Optical Communications, and Sensing Potential\n\nBecause these electrically powered nanoparticles can emit such clean, well-defined light, they could form the basis of advanced medical technologies. Tiny LnLEDs, potentially injectable or built into wearable devices, might be used for deep-tissue imaging to find cancers, track organ function in real time, or trigger light-activated drugs with high precision.\n\nTheir narrow spectral output also makes them attractive for optical communications, where pure, stable wavelengths can help send more data with less interference. In addition, this platform could support highly sensitive sensors that detect very specific chemicals or biological markers, improving diagnostic tools and environmental monitoring.\n\nFirst-Generation Performance and Future Directions\n\nIn early tests, the researchers achieved a peak external quantum efficiency above 0.6% for their NIR-II LEDs. For a first-generation device built from electrically powered insulating nanoparticles, this performance is considered very promising. The team has also identified clear routes to enhance efficiency further in future designs.\n\n\"This is just the beginning. We've unlocked a whole new class of materials for optoelectronics,\" added Dr. Yunzhou Deng, postdoctoral research associate at the Cavendish Laboratory. \"The fundamental principle is so versatile that we can now explore countless combinations of organic molecules and insulating nanomaterials. This will allow us to create devices with tailored properties for applications we haven't even thought of yet.\"\n\nThis work was supported in part by a UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Frontier Research Grant (EP/Y015584/1) and Postdoctoral Individual Fellowships (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship grant scheme).",

      "content": "More than 60% of researchers surveyed about AI say they use it for work.Credit: MD Abu Sufian Jewel/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nScientists are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to do their work. Many say the tools are saving them time and money, but others have seen the negative effects that such tools can have on research.\n\nIn a survey of more than 2,400 researchers released in October by the publishing company Wiley, 62% of respondents said they used AI for tasks related to research or publication — up from 45% in 2024, when there were 1,043 respondents. Early-career scientists and researchers in physical sciences were the most likely to use AI tools in their work, and were more likely to be early adopters of AI than were later-career researchers or those working in humanities, mathematics or statistics.\n\nResearchers are using AI tools to help with writing, editing and translating. They are also using them to detect errors or bias in their writing, and to summarize large volumes of studies. In a sample of 2,059 respondents, 85% said AI helped with efficiency, 77% that it helped to increase the quantity of work completed, and 73% that it improved the quality of their work.\n\nMatthew Bailes, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, says AI tools are popular among astronomers, helping them to process massive data sets. His team has been using AI for about a decade to identify neutron-star signatures in their data. “When you’ve got 10,000 candidates, it’s handy to just be able to whip through it in a few seconds, rather than manually looking at everything.”\n\nHis team is also developing a virtual simulation of the Universe. The project uses a plug-in version of the generative AI model Claude, developed by Anthropic in San Francisco, California, to display data alongside visualizations. Bailes hopes to use it as a “co-teacher”. It could show a simulation of a globular cluster — a collection of thousands to millions of stars — against graphs showing how many black holes or neutron stars develop over time. “The opportunities for education there are phenomenal,” he adds.\n\nProductivity boost\n\nAI is also having an impact on scientists’ outputs and their careers. A 2024 preprint1 published on arXiv reports that scientists who used AI published more papers, had more citations and became team leaders four years earlier than those who did not use AI.\n\nThe researchers used a large language model to identify more than one million AI-assisted papers among 67.9 million studies published in six fields between 1980 and 2024. The authors note that “AI accelerates work in established, data-rich domains”. That suggests that although AI might enhance the productivity of individual scientists, it could reduce scientific diversity, they say.\n\nMany researchers worry about other detrimental effects of AI on research. The survey by Wiley, based in Hoboken, New Jersey, found that 87% of people were concerned about AI making errors, called hallucinations, and about data security, ethics and a lack of transparency around training. In last year’s survey, the figure was 81%.",
