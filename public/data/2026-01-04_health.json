      "title": "Scientists found a way to help aging guts heal themselves",
      "summary": "Researchers have discovered a way to help aging intestines heal themselves using CAR T-cell therapy. By targeting senescent cells that build up over time, the treatment boosted gut regeneration, reduced inflammation, and improved nutrient absorption in mice. It even helped protect the intestine from radiation damage, with benefits lasting up to a year. Early results in human intestinal cells suggest the approach could one day improve gut health in older adults and cancer patients.",
      "content": "Many people notice that certain foods become harder to tolerate with age. One possible reason is damage to the intestinal epithelium, a thin, single layer of cells that lines the intestine. This lining is essential for digestion and overall gut health. In healthy conditions, the intestinal epithelium renews itself every three to five days. Aging or exposure to cancer radiation can disrupt this renewal process, slowing or stopping regeneration altogether. When that happens, inflammation can rise and conditions such as leaky gut syndrome may develop.\n\nScientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) have now identified a promising way to jump-start intestinal repair. Their strategy relies on CAR T-cell therapy, a powerful form of immunotherapy best known for treating certain cancers. By applying this approach to the gut, the researchers hope to open the door to future clinical trials aimed at improving intestinal health, particularly in people affected by age-related decline.\n\nTargeting Aging Cells That Refuse to Die\n\nThis work builds on earlier research led by CSHL Assistant Professor Corina Amor Vegas, whose laboratory studies cellular senescence. As the body ages, it accumulates senescent cells, which no longer divide but also do not die off. These lingering cells have been linked to many age-related conditions, including diabetes and dementia. In earlier studies, Amor Vegas and her team engineered immune cells known as anti-uPAR CAR T cells that selectively remove senescent cells in mice, leading to major improvements in the animals' metabolism.\n\nThe researchers next asked whether removing senescent cells could help restore the intestine's ability to heal. Amor Vegas partnered with CSHL Assistant Professor Semir Beyaz and graduate student Onur Eskiocak to investigate. They delivered CAR T cells directly to the intestines of both younger and older mice. According to Amor Vegas, the results were striking. \"In both cases, we see really significant improvements,\" she says. \"They're able to absorb nutrients better. They have much less inflammation. When irritated or injured, their epithelial lining is able to regenerate and heal much faster.\"\n\nProtection Against Radiation-Induced Gut Damage\n\nLeaky gut syndrome is particularly common among cancer patients who receive pelvic or abdominal radiation therapy. To model this, the team exposed mice to radiation that damaged their intestinal epithelial cells. Mice treated with CAR T cells recovered far more effectively than those that did not receive the therapy. Notably, a single dose of CAR T-cell treatment continued to support healthier gut function for at least one year.\n\nThe researchers also found compelling evidence that anti-uPAR CAR T cells encourage regeneration in human intestinal and colorectal cells, Eskiocak notes. While the precise biological mechanisms behind this effect are still being explored, the findings point to strong therapeutic potential. Beyaz emphasizes the broader significance of the work. \"This is one good step toward a long journey in understanding how we can better heal the elderly,\" he said.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – As people get older, their intestines can have trouble healing because the lining inside them stops renewing properly. This can cause problems with digestion and lead to inflammation or a condition called leaky gut. Radiation treatment for cancer can also harm the intestines, making healing even harder.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory found a way to improve the healing of aging intestines using a special treatment called CAR T-cell therapy. This therapy targets and removes old cells called senescent cells that build up and cause damage. When they tested this on mice, the mice’s intestines healed faster, absorbed nutrients better, and had less inflammation. The treatment also helped protect intestines from radiation damage, with effects lasting up to a year. Early tests on human cells show it might work similarly in people.\n\n**Impact** – This is important because it offers a new way to help older adults and cancer patients recover gut health. Removing senescent cells lets the intestines repair themselves naturally, which could improve digestion and reduce gut problems. The fact that one treatment can last a long time makes it promising for future therapies.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists plan to study how exactly this therapy works in humans and hope to start clinical trials.

      "summary": "Your daily rhythm may matter more for brain health than previously thought. Older adults with weaker, more disrupted activity patterns were far more likely to develop dementia than those with steady routines. A later daily energy peak was also linked to higher risk. The study points to the body clock as a possible early warning sign for cognitive decline.",
      "content": "Highlights:\n\nA large new study suggests the body's internal clock, known as circadian rhythm, may play an important role in dementia risk.\n\nMore than 2,000 older adults wore small monitors for about 12 days, allowing researchers to closely track daily patterns of rest and activity.\n\nPeople whose body clocks were weaker or more irregular were significantly more likely to develop dementia over the following years.\n\nThose whose activity levels peaked later in the day, rather than earlier, showed a 45% higher risk of dementia.\n\nResearchers say future studies exploring circadian rhythm approaches such as light exposure or lifestyle changes could reveal new ways to reduce dementia risk.\n\nWeaker Body Clocks Linked to Dementia Risk\n\nA new study suggests that disruptions in the body's internal clock may be tied to a higher risk of dementia. Research published on December 29, 2025, in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, found that people with weaker and more irregular circadian rhythms were more likely to develop dementia. The study also showed that individuals whose daily activity levels peaked later in the day faced a higher risk than those who peaked earlier. While these findings reveal a strong link, they do not show that circadian rhythm changes directly cause dementia.\n\nWhat Circadian Rhythms Do in the Body\n\nCircadian rhythm refers to the body's natural timing system. It controls the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle and helps regulate key functions such as hormone release, digestion, and body temperature. This internal clock is directed by the brain and responds to environmental signals, especially light.\n\nWhen circadian rhythms are strong, the body stays closely aligned with the daily cycle of light and dark. This leads to consistent patterns of sleep and activity, even when schedules or seasons change. In contrast, weaker rhythms make the body clock more sensitive to disruptions. People with less stable rhythms are more likely to shift their sleep and activity times due to changes in routine or daylight.\n\nAging, Circadian Changes, and Dementia\n\n\"Changes in circadian rhythms happen with aging, and evidence suggests that circadian rhythm disturbances may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases like dementia,\" said study author Wendy Wang, MPH, PhD, of the Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. \"Our study measured these rest-activity rhythms and found people with weaker and more fragmented rhythms, and people with activity levels that peaked later in the day, had an elevated risk of dementia.\"\n\nWho Took Part in the Study\n\nThe research followed 2,183 adults with an average age of 79 who did not have dementia when the study began. Among the participants, 24% were Black people and 76% were white people.\n\nEach participant wore a small heart monitor attached to the chest for an average of 12 days. These devices tracked periods of rest and activity, allowing researchers to analyze circadian rhythm patterns. Participants were then monitored for about three years. During that time, 176 people were diagnosed with dementia.\n\nHow Researchers Measured Rhythm Strength\n\nScientists examined the heart monitor data using several indicators of circadian rhythm strength. One key measure was relative amplitude, which reflects the difference between a person's most active and least active times of day. Higher relative amplitude indicated a stronger and more clearly defined daily rhythm.\n\nParticipants were divided into three groups based on rhythm strength. When comparing the strongest and weakest groups, 31 of the 728 people in the high rhythm group developed dementia, while 106 of the 727 people in the low rhythm group did. After accounting for factors such as age, blood pressure, and heart disease, researchers found that those in the weakest rhythm group had nearly two and a half times the risk of dementia. Each standard deviation drop in relative amplitude was linked to a 54% increase in dementia risk.\n\nLater Activity Peaks and Higher Risk\n\nThe timing of daily activity also appeared to matter. People whose activity peaked later in the afternoon, at 2:15 p.m. or later, had a higher risk of dementia than those whose activity peaked earlier, between 1:11 p.m.-2:14 p.m. About 7% of participants in the earlier peak group developed dementia, compared with 10% in the later peak group, representing a 45% higher risk.\n\nA later activity peak may reflect a mismatch between the body's internal clock and environmental signals such as daylight and darkness.\n\nWhy Disrupted Rhythms Might Matter\n\n\"Disruptions in circadian rhythms may alter body processes like inflammation, and may interfere with sleep, possibly increasing amyloid plaques linked to dementia, or reducing amyloid clearance from the brain,\" said Wang. \"Future studies should examine the potential role of circadian rhythm interventions, such as light therapy or lifestyle changes, to determine if they may help lower a person's risk of dementia.\"\n\nStudy Limitations\n\nOne limitation of the research is that it did not include data on sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, which could have influenced the results.",

      "title": "A hidden brain problem may be an early warning for Alzheimer’s",
      "summary": "Researchers discovered that clogged brain “drains” show up early in people at risk of Alzheimer’s disease. These blockages, easily seen on standard MRI scans, are tied to toxic protein buildup linked to memory loss and cognitive decline. In some cases, they may signal Alzheimer’s earlier than other commonly used brain markers. This could help physicians detect the disease earlier, before irreversible damage sets in.",
      "content": "Scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) have found that the brain's waste removal system often becomes blocked in people who show early signs of Alzheimer's disease. These blockages interfere with the brain's ability to clear harmful substances and may appear well before clear dementia symptoms develop.\n\nThe clogged pathways are known as \"enlarged perivascular spaces,\" and the findings suggest they could serve as an early warning signal for Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia.\n\n\"Since these brain anomalies can be visually identified on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed to evaluate cognitive decline, identifying them could complement existing methods to detect Alzheimer's earlier, without having to do and pay for additional tests,\" said Associate Professor Nagaendran Kandiah from NTU's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), who led the study.\n\nJustin Ong, a fifth-year LKCMedicine student and the study's first author, emphasized the importance of early detection. He noted that identifying Alzheimer's sooner gives doctors more time to intervene and potentially slow the progression of symptoms such as memory loss, reduced thinking speed, and mood changes. The research was conducted as part of LKCMedicine's Scholarly Project module in the School's Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery programme.\n\nWhy Studying Asian Populations Matters\n\nThe study stands out because it focuses on Asian populations, an area that has been underrepresented in Alzheimer's research. Most existing studies have concentrated on Caucasian participants, which may limit how broadly their findings apply.\n\nThe NTU team examined nearly 1,000 people in Singapore from different ethnic backgrounds that reflect the country's population. Participants included individuals with normal cognitive function as well as those experiencing mild thinking difficulties.\n\nResearch has shown that dementia does not affect all ethnic groups in the same way, making region specific studies essential.\n\n\"For example, among Caucasians with dementia, past studies show that the prevalence of a major risk gene, apolipoprotein E4, linked to Alzheimer's is around 50 to 60 percent. But among Singapore dementia patients, it is less than 20 percent,\" said Assoc Prof Kandiah, who is also Director of the Dementia Research Centre (Singapore) in LKCMedicine. Because of these differences, findings in one population may not directly apply to another.\n\nHow the Brain Clears Toxic Waste\n\nInside the brain, blood vessels are surrounded by small channels called perivascular spaces. These spaces help drain toxic waste products, including beta amyloid and tau proteins, which are found in high levels in people with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWhen the brain's waste removal system becomes less efficient, these spaces can enlarge and become visible on MRI scans. Until now, it was unclear whether this change was directly linked to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.\n\nTo answer this question, the NTU researchers compared enlarged perivascular spaces with multiple established indicators of Alzheimer's. They also examined how these clogged drainage pathways relate to well known disease markers such as beta amyloid buildup and damage to the brain's white matter, the network of nerve fibers that connects different brain regions.\n\nComparing Healthy Brains and Early Cognitive Decline\n\nThe study included nearly 350 participants with normal thinking abilities, including memory, reasoning, decision making, and focus. The remaining participants showed signs of early cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment, a condition that often precedes dementia.\n\nPrevious research has shown that people with mild cognitive impairment face a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, which is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.\n\nAfter analyzing MRI scans, the researchers found that participants with mild cognitive impairment were more likely to have enlarged perivascular spaces than those with no cognitive problems.\n\nBlood Markers Strengthen the Link\n\nIn addition to brain scans, the scientists measured seven Alzheimer's related biochemicals in participants' blood, including beta amyloid and tau proteins. Elevated levels of these substances are considered warning signs of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nEnlarged perivascular spaces were linked to four of the seven biochemical measurements. This suggests that people with clogged brain drains are more likely to have increased amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and damage to brain cells, placing them at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nThe researchers also looked at white matter damage, a widely used indicator of Alzheimer's, and found it was associated with six of the seven blood markers. However, further analysis revealed something unexpected.\n\nAmong participants with mild cognitive impairment, the connection between Alzheimer's related biochemicals and enlarged perivascular spaces was stronger than the connection with white matter damage. This finding points to clogged brain drainage as a particularly early signal of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nImplications for Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nThese insights may help doctors make more informed decisions about early treatment strategies, potentially slowing disease progression before lasting brain damage occurs.\n\n\"The findings carry substantial clinical implications,\" said Assoc Prof Kandiah. \"Although white matter damage is more widely used in clinical practice to evaluate for dementia, as it is easily recognised on MRI scans, our results suggest that enlarged perivascular spaces may hold unique value in detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nDr. Rachel Cheong Chin Yee, a Senior Consultant and Deputy Head at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's Department of Geriatric Medicine, said the study highlights the role of small blood vessel changes in Alzheimer's development.\n\n\"These findings are significant because they suggest that brain scans showing enlarged perivascular spaces could potentially help identify people at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease, even before symptoms appear,\" said Dr. Cheong, who was not involved in the research.\n\nRethinking Brain Vessel Disease and Alzheimer's\n\nDr. Chong Yao Feng, a Consultant at the National University Hospital's Division of Neurology who was also not involved in the study, noted that cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease have traditionally been viewed as separate conditions.\n\n\"The study's findings are intriguing as they demonstrate that both diseases do interact in a synergistic manner,\" said Dr. Chong, who is also a Clinical Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.\n\nAs a result, doctors reviewing MRI scans should be cautious about assuming cognitive symptoms are caused only by blood vessel problems when markers such as enlarged perivascular spaces are present. These features may also signal a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"Doctors will then have to use their clinical judgement of the patient's scan and symptoms, as well as discuss with the patient, to determine if more checks are needed to confirm whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease or not,\" said Dr. Chong.\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\nThe NTU research team plans to track participants over time to determine how many eventually develop Alzheimer's dementia. This follow up will help confirm whether enlarged perivascular spaces can reliably predict progression to dementia.\n\nIf future studies in other populations reach similar conclusions, identifying clogged brain drains on MRI scans could become a routine tool for detecting Alzheimer's risk much earlier than is currently possible.",

      "personality_presentation_es": "**Contexto** – La enfermedad de Alzheimer es una forma común de demencia que causa pérdida de memoria y problemas para pensar. Es difícil detectarla temprano porque los síntomas suelen aparecer tarde. Los científicos buscan señales tempranas en el cerebro para ayudar a los médicos a encontrar la enfermedad más pronto.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigadores de la Universidad Tecnológica de Nanyang en Singapur descubrieron que los “drenajes” cerebrales bloqueados, llamados espacios perivasculares agrandados, aparecen temprano en personas con riesgo de Alzheimer. Estas obstrucciones se pueden ver en escaneos MRI normales. El equipo estudió a casi 1,000 personas de diferentes grupos étnicos en Singapur, incluyendo algunas con funciones cognitivas normales y otras con problemas leves. Encontraron que quienes tenían dificultades de pensamiento temprano tenían más probabilidades de tener estos drenajes bloqueados.\n\n**Impacto** – Este hallazgo es importante porque ofrece una nueva forma de detectar el riesgo de Alzheimer más temprano que algunos marcadores actuales. Estas obstrucciones están relacionadas con la acumulación de proteínas tóxicas que causan pérdida de memoria. Como los espacios perivasculares agrandados se ven en MRI de rutina, los médicos podrían detectar Alzheimer sin pruebas adicionales costosas. El estudio también se enfoca en poblaciones asiáticas, que han sido menos estudiadas, haciendo los resultados más relevantes para grupos diversos.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores planean seguir a los participantes con el tiempo para ver quién desarrolla Alzheimer. Esto ayudará a confirmar si estos drenajes bloqueados pueden predecir la enfermedad con seguridad. Si se confirma, este método podría ser una forma común y sencilla de detectar el riesgo temprano y comenzar el tratamiento antes.\n\n**Conclusión en una frase** – Bloqueos visibles en el sistema de drenaje del cerebro en MRI pueden ayudar a los médicos a identificar Alzheimer más temprano, mejorando las oportunidades de atención oportuna.",

      "summary": "The brain constantly blends split-second reactions with slower, more thoughtful processing, and new research shows how it pulls this off. Scientists discovered that brain regions operate on different internal clocks and rely on white matter connections to share information across these timescales. The way this timing is organized affects how efficiently the brain switches between activity patterns tied to behavior. Differences in this system may help explain why people vary in cognitive ability.",
      "content": "The human brain is always at work, handling information that arrives on very different timelines. Some signals demand instant reactions to changes in the environment, while others unfold more slowly as we interpret meaning, context, or intent.\n\nA new study from Rutgers Health, published in Nature Communications, explores how the brain brings these fast and slow signals together. The research focuses on how networks of white matter connections allow different brain regions to communicate, supporting thinking, decision making, and behavior.\n\nBrain Regions Run on Different Internal Clocks\n\nNot all parts of the brain process information in the same way or at the same pace. Each region operates over a characteristic time window, known as intrinsic neural timescales, or INTs for short. These timescales reflect how long a region holds onto information before moving on to the next signal.\n\n\"To affect our environment through action, our brains must combine information processed over different timescales,\" said Linden Parkes, assistant professor of Psychiatry at Rutgers Health and the senior author of the study. \"The brain achieves this by leveraging its white matter connectivity to share information across regions, and this integration is crucial for human behavior.\"\n\nMapping Brain Connectivity in Nearly 1,000 People\n\nTo understand how this integration works, Parkes and his colleagues examined brain imaging data from 960 individuals. Using this information, they created detailed maps of each person's brain connections, known as connectomes. The team then applied mathematical models that describe how complex systems evolve over time to track how information moves through these networks.\n\n\"Our work probes the mechanisms underlying this process in humans by directly modeling regions' INTs from their connectivity,\" said Parkes, a core member of the Rutgers Brain Health Institute and the Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research. \"This draws a direct link between how brain regions process information locally and how that processing is shared across the brain to produce behavior.\"\n\nWhy Timing Differences Matter for Cognition\n\nThe researchers found that how neural timescales are arranged across the cerebral cortex plays a key role in how efficiently the brain shifts between large scale patterns of activity tied to behavior. This timing organization was not the same for everyone.\n\n\"We found that differences in how the brain processes information at different speeds help explain why people vary in their cognitive abilities,\" Parkes said.\n\nThe study also showed that these timing patterns are connected to genetic, molecular, and cellular features of brain tissue, tying the findings to basic biological processes. Similar links were seen in the mouse brain, suggesting that these mechanisms are shared across species.\n\n\"Our work highlights a fundamental link between the brain's white matter connectivity and its local computational properties,\" Parkes said. \"People whose brain wiring is better matched to the way different regions handle fast and slow information tend to show higher cognitive capacity.\"\n\nImplications for Mental Health Research\n\nBuilding on these results, the research team is now applying the same approach to neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. The goal is to understand how changes in brain connectivity might disrupt the way information is processed over time.\n\nThe study was conducted in collaboration with Avram Holmes, an associate professor of psychiatry and a core member of the Rutgers Brain Health Institute and the Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research, along with postdoctoral researchers Ahmad Beyh and Amber Howell, as well as Jason Z. Kim from Cornell University.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – The brain processes information at different speeds. Some parts react instantly, while others take more time to understand meaning or make decisions. Scientists have long wondered how these fast and slow signals work together.\n\n**What happened** – Researchers at Rutgers Health studied brain scans from 960 people to see how different brain areas communicate using white matter connections. They found that each brain region works on its own internal clock, holding information for different lengths of time. These clocks help the brain combine quick reactions with slower thinking.\n\n**Impact** – This timing system is important because it influences how well the brain switches between activities linked to behavior. People have different timing patterns, which helps explain why some think faster or better than others. The study also connected these timing patterns to basic brain biology and found similar systems in mice, showing this is a common brain feature.\n\n**What’s next step** – The researchers will use this knowledge to study mental health conditions like schizophrenia and depression. They hope to learn how changes in brain timing and connections might affect how people with these conditions think and behave.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – The brain’s unique internal clocks and connections help shape how we think, and understanding this may improve how we study cognition and mental health.",
