      "title": "Scientists warn climate models are missing a key ocean player",
      "summary": "Tiny marine plankton that build calcium carbonate shells play an outsized role in regulating Earth’s climate, quietly pulling carbon from the atmosphere and helping lock it away in the deep ocean. New research shows these microscopic engineers are largely missing from the climate models used to forecast our planet’s future, meaning scientists may be underestimating how the ocean responds to climate change.",
      "content": "Some of the most important players in Earth's climate system are nearly invisible. Calcifying plankton, microscopic organisms that form hard shells, help regulate the planet's temperature by capturing carbon and moving it through the ocean. A new review published in Science finds that these organisms are not fully represented in the climate models used to predict Earth's future. The research was led by an international team from the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (ICTA-UAB) (Spain).\n\nThe study focuses on three major groups of calcifying plankton: coccolithophores, foraminifers, and pteropods. According to the authors, climate models often simplify or exclude these organisms, which can lead to an incomplete picture of how the ocean responds to climate change.\n\nHow Calcifying Plankton Shape the Carbon Cycle\n\nWhen climate models leave out calcifying plankton, they may miss key steps in the global carbon cycle. These organisms build tiny shells made of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), a substance that plays a central role in ocean chemistry. As plankton grow and die, they help move carbon from the atmosphere into deeper layers of the ocean.\n\nThis process, known as the ocean carbon pump, helps stabilize Earth's climate over long periods of time. It also affects seawater chemistry and contributes to the formation of sediments that scientists use to study past climates.\n\n\"Plankton shells are tiny, but together they shape the chemistry of our oceans and the climate of our planet,\" said Patrizia Ziveri, ICREA research professor at ICTA-UAB and lead author of the study. \"By leaving them out of climate models, we risk overlooking fundamental processes that determine how the Earth system responds to climate change.\"\n\nThe Missing Process of Shallow Dissolution\n\nThe researchers point out that much of the calcium carbonate produced by plankton does not sink all the way to the ocean floor. Instead, a significant portion dissolves in the upper ocean, a process known as \"shallow dissolution.\" This breakdown is driven by biological activity, including predation, clumping of particles, and microbial respiration.\n\nShallow dissolution changes ocean chemistry in important ways, yet it is largely missing from major Earth System Models (e.g. CMIP6) used in global climate assessments. Without accounting for this process, models may misjudge how carbon moves through the ocean and how the system responds to environmental stress.\n\nDifferent Plankton Face Different Climate Threats\n\nThe study also emphasizes that not all calcifying plankton behave the same way. Each group has unique characteristics that influence where it lives, how it functions in marine ecosystems, and how vulnerable it is to climate change.\n\nCoccolithophores are the largest producers of CaCO 3 , but they are especially sensitive to ocean acidification because they lack specialized mechanisms to remove excess acidity from their cells. Foraminifers and pteropods do have such mechanisms, but they face other risks, including declining oxygen levels and rising ocean temperatures. Together, these organisms determine how carbon is stored and recycled in the ocean, and treating them as a single group can oversimplify the ocean's response to climate pressures.\n\nImproving Climate Models With Better Ocean Biology\n\nThe authors call for urgent efforts to measure how much calcium carbonate each plankton group produces, dissolves, and exports to deeper waters. They argue that incorporating these details into climate models would improve predictions of ocean and atmosphere interactions, long-term carbon storage, and the interpretation of sediment records used to reconstruct Earth's climate history.\n\n\"If we ignore the ocean's smallest organisms, we might miss important climate dynamics,\" says Dr. Ziveri. \"Integrating calcifying plankton into climate models could offer sharper predictions and deeper insights into how ecosystems and societies may be affected.\"\n\nThe researchers conclude that closing these knowledge gaps is essential for building the next generation of climate models, ones that more accurately reflect the biological complexity of the oceans.",

      "personality_title": "Tiny ocean plankton missing from climate models, new study finds",
      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Tiny marine plankton with hard shells help control Earth’s climate by pulling carbon from the air and storing it in the deep ocean. These tiny creatures are important for keeping the ocean’s chemistry balanced and affecting global temperatures.\n\n**What happened** – Scientists from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona led a study showing that climate models often leave out or simplify these calcifying plankton. The study focused on three main types: coccolithophores, foraminifers, and pteropods. These plankton make calcium carbonate shells that help move carbon deep into the ocean, but many climate models don’t fully include their role.\n\n**Impact** – Leaving these plankton out means climate models might miss important steps in how carbon moves through the ocean. For example, a process called \"shallow dissolution,\" where plankton shells break down in upper ocean layers, changes ocean chemistry but isn’t well represented in models. Also, different plankton face different climate threats, so treating them all the same can oversimplify how the ocean reacts to climate change.\n\n**What’s next step** – Researchers want to measure exactly how much calcium carbonate each plankton group produces and dissolves, and add these details into climate models. This will help scientists make better predictions about how oceans and the atmosphere interact and improve understanding of past and future climate changes.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Including tiny calcifying plankton in climate models will improve how we predict the ocean’s role in Earth's changing climate.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – De minuscules planctons marins avec des coquilles dures aident à réguler le climat de la Terre en capturant le carbone de l’air et en le stockant dans l’océan profond. Ces petits organismes sont essentiels pour maintenir l’équilibre chimique des océans et influencer la température globale.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des scientifiques de l'Université autonome de Barcelone ont mené une étude montrant que les modèles climatiques ignorent souvent ces planctons calcifiants ou les simplifient. L’étude a porté sur trois types principaux : coccolithophores, foraminifères et ptéropodes. Ces planctons fabriquent des coquilles en carbonate de calcium qui aident à transporter le carbone vers les profondeurs de l’océan, mais leur rôle est peu pris en compte dans les modèles.\n\n**Impact** – En les excluant, les modèles risquent de manquer des étapes importantes du cycle du carbone dans l’océan. Par exemple, la « dissolution superficielle », un processus où les coquilles se décomposent dans les couches supérieures de l’océan, modifie la chimie marine mais n’est pas bien représentée. De plus, chaque type de plancton fait face à des menaces différentes, donc les traiter de manière uniforme simplifie trop la réaction de l’océan au changement climatique.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les chercheurs souhaitent mesurer précisément la production et la dissolution de carbonate de calcium par chaque groupe de planctons et intégrer ces données dans les modèles climatiques. Cela aidera à mieux prévoir l’interaction entre les océans et l’atmosphère et à mieux comprendre les changements climatiques passés et futurs.\n\n**Une phrase clé** – Intégrer les minuscules planctons calcifiants dans les modèles climatiques améliorera nos prévisions du rôle des océans face au changement climatique.\n",

      "title": "This weird deep-sea creature was named by thousands of people online",
      "summary": "A newly discovered deep-sea creature has become an unlikely Internet star. After appearing in a popular YouTube video, a rare chiton found nearly three miles beneath the ocean surface sparked a global naming effort, drawing more than 8,000 suggestions from people around the world. Scientists ultimately chose the name Ferreiraella populi, meaning “of the people,” honoring the public that helped bring it into the scientific record.",
      "content": "The Senckenberg Ocean Species Alliance (SOSA), working with scientific publisher Pensoft Publishers and well known science YouTuber Ze Frank, invited the public to help name a newly identified deep-sea chiton (a type of marine mollusk). The official scientific description of the species was published today in the open-access Biodiversity Data Journal.\n\nMore than 8,000 name ideas were submitted through social media. After reviewing the entries, the research team selected the name Ferreiraella populi. The species name populi is a Latin singular noun in the genitive case meaning \"of the people.\" Interestingly, 11 different participants independently suggested the same name during the online naming effort.\n\nFrom a YouTube Video to a Scientific Name\n\nThe public naming campaign began after Ze Frank featured the rare deep-sea chiton from the genus Ferreiraella in an episode of his \"True Facts\" YouTube series.\n\nThe animal has eight armored shell plates and an iron-clad radula (a rasping tongue). Near its tail, it also hosts a small group of worms that feed on its excrement. Viewers were invited to submit a proposed scientific name along with a justification. In just one week, the response exceeded 8,000 suggestions.\n\n\"We were overwhelmed by the response and the massive number of creative name suggestions!\" says Prof. Dr. Julia Sigwart, co-chair of SOSA at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt. \"The name we chose, Ferreiraella populi, translates to \"of the people.\" \"\n\nSeveral other names stood out during the selection process. One was Ferreiraella stellacadens, meaning \"Shooting star chiton,\" inspired by the animal's distinctive aesthete pattern and the way it quickly gained attention. Another suggestion was Fereiraella ohmu, referencing a chiton-like creature from a Studio Ghibli film and offering a nod to Japan, where the species was discovered.\n\nA Rare Specialist of the Deep Ocean\n\nThe species was first found in 2024 in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench at a depth of 5,500 meters. Ferreiraella populi belongs to the genus Ferreiraella, a rare group of mollusks known for living only on sunken wood in the deep sea.\n\nThe discovery adds to a lineage of chitons that has received little scientific attention so far and supports growing evidence that deep-sea wood-fall ecosystems host highly specialized communities that remain largely unknown, explains Sigwart.\n\nChitons are often described as resembling a mix between a snail and a beetle. Unlike most mollusks that have a single shell, chitons have eight separate shell plates (valves). This structure allows them to curl into a protective ball or cling tightly to uneven surfaces such as deep-sea wood-falls. Chitons live in environments ranging from shallow coastal waters and coral reefs to the deep ocean, where some species survive at depths of up to 7,000 meters in complete darkness.\n\nHow Scientific Names Are Created\n\nWhen a new species is discovered, it is given a formal scientific name as part of its original taxonomic description. This system follows Carl Linnaeus's principle of binomial nomenclature and includes two parts: the genus name (the first part, capitalized and italicized) and the specific epithet (the second part, lowercase and italicized). The name is assigned by the author(s) who publish the first scientific description and must follow international rules such as the ICZN (zoology) or the ICN (botany). Each name must be unique, latinized, and previously unused. Specific epithets are often based on physical traits, locations, mythology, or people honored for their contributions.\n\nWhy Speed Matters for Ocean Biodiversity\n\nFerreiraella populi highlights the vast biodiversity of the oceans, much of which remains unexplored. Many species disappear before scientists even realize they exist, a problem that is especially pronounced among marine invertebrates, says Sigwart.\n\n\"It can often take ten, if not twenty years, for a new species to be studied, scientifically described, named, and published. At SOSA, we have therefore made it our mission to streamline these processes while simultaneously engaging the public with these fascinating creatures. Finding a name for the chiton together on social media is a wonderful opportunity to do just that! Ferreiraella populi has now been described and given a scientific name only two years after its discovery. This is crucial for the conservation of marine diversity, especially in light of the threats it faces such as deep-sea mining!\"",
