      "title": "A bonobo’s pretend tea party is rewriting what we know about imagination",
      "summary": "A bonobo named Kanzi surprised scientists by successfully playing along in pretend tea party experiments, tracking imaginary juice and grapes as if they were real. He consistently pointed to the correct locations of pretend items, while still choosing real food when given the option. The results suggest that imagination may not be exclusive to humans after all.",
      "content": "In a set of playful experiments modeled after children's tea parties, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have shown for the first time that apes can use imagination and take part in pretend play. This ability was long believed to belong only to humans.\n\nAcross three carefully designed experiments, a single bonobo interacted with imaginary juice and pretend grapes in a consistent and repeatable way. The results push back against traditional ideas about animal intelligence and suggest that some animals may think more flexibly than previously assumed.\n\nThe researchers say the ability to understand pretend objects appears to fall within the cognitive range of at least one enculturated ape. They also suggest this mental skill may have deep evolutionary roots, possibly stretching back 6 to 9 million years to a shared ancestor of humans and modern apes.\n\n\"It really is game-changing that their mental lives go beyond the here and now,\" said co-author Christopher Krupenye, a Johns Hopkins assistant professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences who studies how animals think. \"Imagination has long been seen as a critical element of what it is to be human but the idea that it may not be exclusive to our species is really transformative.\n\n\"Jane Goodall discovered that chimps make tools and that led to a change in the definition of what it means to be human and this, too, really invites us to reconsider what makes us special and what mental life is out there among other creatures.\"\n\nThe study was published in Science.\n\nHow Pretend Play Develops in Humans\n\nHuman children typically begin engaging in pretend activities, such as tea parties, by around age two. Even younger infants show early signs of understanding make-believe. At just 15-months-old, babies often react with surprise when someone pretends to empty a cup and then acts as if they are drinking from it.\n\nDespite these well-documented behaviors in children, no controlled experiments had previously tested whether nonhuman animals could understand or track pretend situations. This gap existed even though there have been many anecdotal observations from both the wild and captive settings.\n\nIn nature, young female chimpanzees have been seen carrying sticks and treating them like infants. In captivity, at least one chimpanzee appeared to drag imaginary blocks across the floor after playing with real wooden ones.\n\nDesigning a Controlled Test of Ape Imagination\n\nKrupenye and co-author Amalia Bastos, a former Johns Hopkins postdoctoral fellow who is now a lecturer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews, set out to examine pretend play under controlled conditions.\n\nThey designed experiments similar to children's tea parties and tested Kanzi, a 43-year-old bonobo living at Ape Initiative. Kanzi had previously been reported to show signs of pretend behavior and could respond to spoken questions by pointing.\n\nDuring each test, Kanzi sat across a table from an experimenter. The table was arranged with empty cups and pitchers or with bowls and jars, all set up to resemble a playful social activity.\n\nTracking Invisible Juice and Imaginary Grapes\n\nIn the first experiment, two empty transparent cups sat beside an empty transparent pitcher. The experimenter pretended to pour juice into both cups, then acted out dumping the juice from one cup, shaking it to show it was empty. The experimenter then asked Kanzi, \"Where's the juice?\"\n\nMost of the time, Kanzi pointed to the cup that was meant to still contain the pretend juice. He continued to do so even when the experimenter moved the cups around.\n\nTo rule out the possibility that Kanzi believed real juice was hidden inside the cup, the researchers ran a second test. This time, one cup contained real juice and the other contained pretend juice. When asked what he wanted, Kanzi almost always pointed to the real juice.\n\nA third experiment followed the same logic but used grapes instead. The experimenter pretended to eat a grape from an empty container and then placed it into one of two jars. After pretending to empty one jar, the experimenter asked, \"Where's the grape?\" Once again, Kanzi indicated the jar holding the pretend object.\n\nKanzi did not respond correctly every time, but his answers were reliably accurate.\n\nWhat the Findings Mean for Animal Minds\n\n\"It's extremely striking and very exciting that the data seem to suggest that apes, in their minds, can conceive of things that are not there,\" Bastos said. \"Kanzi is able to generate an idea of this pretend object and at the same time know it's not real.\"\n\nThe researchers say these findings open the door to further studies. Future work may explore whether other apes, or even other animals, can engage in pretend play or track imaginary objects. The team is also interested in testing related mental abilities, such as thinking about the future or understanding what others might be thinking.\n\n\"Imagination is one of those things that in humans gives us a rich mental life. And if some roots of imagination are shared with apes, that should make people question their assumption that other animals are just living robotic lifestyles constrained to the present,\" Krupenye said. \"We should be compelled by these findings to care for these creatures with rich and beautiful minds and ensure they continue to exist.\"",

      "content": "As a neuroscience postdoc at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, Letizia Mariotti was part of a core group of friends navigating the early steps of their careers. Even after the four friends scattered to academic posts across Europe they continued to meet virtually to talk through the challenges of launching a laboratory.\n\nThe key to a happy lab life is in the manual\n\nIt quickly became apparent that their duties as principal investigators far exceeded the bench skills that they’d learnt as postdocs. Mariotti, for example, struggled with the paperwork needed to hire her first international postdoc at the Institute of Neuroscience of the National Research Council in Padova, Italy. And one of her friends discovered that researchers in France embrace formal academic titles in ways that they hadn’t experienced in the United Kingdom. “You could never predict when something would happen that you’d never had to think about before,” Mariotti says.\n\nThe group collectively recognized that labs need a document that, rather than simply laying out methods and bench protocols, focused on culture and ethos: everything from where to access on-campus resources to intangibles such as a group’s shared mission and codes of conduct.\n\nIn 2024, Mariotti and her friends held the first of two workshops dedicated to creating such a manual — an effort that ultimately kick-started the Starting Aware Fair & Equitable (SAFE) Labs initiative. The resulting SAFE Labs handbook, now freely available online, is one of a growing number of resources dedicated to producing lab handbooks and making academia a more-supportive space. As researchers, institutions and funding agencies take notice of them, these documents are encouraging a collective shift away from unrealistic, and sometimes unhealthy, expectations in academia towards those that prioritize cohesion and support.\n\n“These handbooks are for anyone who wants to create a positive and transparent lab space,” Mariotti says. “The interest and overall positive feedback we’ve gotten really attests to how much this kind of support is needed.”\n\nThe core tenets\n\nExactly how many labs, worldwide, have adopted a lab handbook is unclear, but anecdotally, sources say, interest is growing — partly thanks to the broader recognition that academia is due a change.\n\nScientists across the career spectrum are burnt out, and people are leaving careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in startling numbers, particularly those from under-represented groups.\n\nNature collection: Mentoring\n\nIn 2025, the UK Research Excellence Framework announced its intention to focus more heavily on initiatives that “enable positive research culture” — a move also shared by funders such as the biomedical charity Wellcome in London. Institutions have taken notice, too. The University of Liverpool and the University of York, both in the United Kingdom, have held workshops on lab handbooks. And University College London supported Mariotti’s workshops, allowing her group to survey researchers from across Europe to learn more about the challenges that researchers are facing while running labs in different countries and disciplines (E. Doná et al. Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/qqdp; 2025).\n\nAt its core, a lab handbook should lay out the research focus and expectations for other members of the lab. Typical elements include which platforms a group uses to communicate, codes of conduct and harassment policies, and what students should anticipate in terms of expectations, mentorship and career development.\n\nSeveral scientists say that reflecting on their own experiences as students helped while creating their own handbooks. Leonardo Uieda, a geophysicist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, recalls that his PhD lab lacked a sense of shared identity. “It was always each student for themselves,” he says. And although his experience was positive overall, he adds, “I do feel I missed out on the benefits of a cohesive group”.\n\nFor his lab handbook, Uieda worked with his team to set shared goals and to outline expectations. Students in his lab needn’t stick to conventional working hours, for instance, but they should attend weekly meetings and department seminars. He set different priorities for students and staff in the lab, and laid out a clear authorship policy for publications. “That’s one of the places I’ve seen the most conflict in my career, so I try to cover that really early on,” he says.\n\nLetizia Mariotti and her fellow SAFE Labs founders: Pip Coen (back), Federico Rossi (front) and Stéphane Bugeon (left).Credit: Federico Rossi\n\nOther academics embraced lab handbooks after experiencing a conflict that they wished they’d handled differently. Ben Marwick, an archaeologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, is committed to the concept of ‘open science’, for example, but acknowledges that following best practices to make science transparent and accessible to everyone can take time. At one point, he found himself on the PhD committee of a student who didn’t adhere to such practices. Bringing the student’s data into alignment with Marwick’s policies created a lot of extra work for them, Marwick says, including uploading their code into a new repository and annotating it so that it could be replicated.\n\n“Ultimately, they weren’t sure if it was worth having me on their committee,” Marwick allows, noting that he could have avoided the issue if he had been clearer about his expectations or if he’d asked the student to complete a statement of expectation before Marwick joined his committee. Open science now forms a core part of his lab handbook, and Marwick says that sharing the document with potential students and collaborators has helped to rule out projects that don’t align with his values early on. “The longer I have it up, the more ways I’ve found it to be useful in navigating all kinds of professional relationships,” he says.\n\nMaking them your own\n\nBeyond baseline expectations, lab handbooks might also contain sections that are specific to your research discipline. Some disciplines require fieldwork, for example, or rely heavily on particular types of data. Laying out clear guidelines about how lab members should conduct themselves, and how data should be handled and organized, can prevent future headaches.",

      "content": "Scientists have captured remarkable footage of the young of a mouse-sized marsupial, called a fat-tailed dunnart, making their way to their mother’s pouch soon after being born\n\nMinuscule marsupial newborns that weigh less than a grain of rice have been filmed crawling towards their mother’s pouch for the first time.\n\nUnlike placental mammals, which give birth to much more developed babies, marsupials are born after extremely short gestation periods and must move to a pouch where they attach to a teat and continue to grow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many of Australia’s rare and small marsupials, this process remains a mystery – even for those species that are kept in captive colonies, says Brandon Menzies at the University of Melbourne, Australia.\n\nMenzies and his colleagues maintain a large population of hundreds of fat-tailed dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), which are considered to be one of the closest relatives of the extinct Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus). In collaboration with the firm Colossal Biosciences, they hope to one day bring back the Tasmanian tiger, or something resembling it, by gene-editing dunnarts.\n\nHowever, even though the colony was established decades ago and the fertility of the females is closely monitored, no one has ever observed the birth of any pouch young or how they travel to attach to the mother’s teats.\n\nFree newsletter Sign up to The Earth Edition Unmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month. Sign up to newsletter\n\nMenzies says this is because there is no pregnancy test for the species, they are nocturnal and give birth overnight, and the dash to the pouch is estimated to take only half a minute for each batch of neonates over the 12 to 24 hours when groups of young are born.\n\nAdult fat-tailed dunnarts Emily Scicluna\n\nBut in 2024, a member of the team noticed blood in one of the enclosures. When the female dunnart was turned upside down and examined, the researchers saw tiny neonates, which weigh only 5 milligrams, making their way towards their mother’s pouch.\n\n“We just saw the pouch young sort of waving their arms and crawling and wriggling,” says Menzies. “It’s very much a freestyle-swimming type of crawl, or a commando crawl.”\n\nYoung dunnarts in their mother’s pouch Emily Scicluna\n\nRealising this was a moment no one had ever captured before, Menzies managed to film 22 seconds of footage before returning the mother to her enclosure the right way up, as gravity is thought to be one of the key cues the young use to navigate.\n\nThe researchers estimate that the young were making arm movements at the rate of about 120 per minute.\n\nThe crawl to the teat is just the first test of survival: being a young marsupial is a brutal business, as many species give birth to more babies than the number of teats available. Fat-tailed dunnarts can gestate up to 17 young, but can only feed 10 – a less competitive attrition rate compared with that of Tasmanian devils, which give birth to up to 30 young and have only four teats.\n\nMenzies says it is phenomenal that after only 14 days of gestation, the fat-tailed dunnarts can give birth to young that can move their arms and navigate to find a teat – which is why, until now, it was thought that the babies were so small that they must have been squirted directly into the pouch.\n\n“The fact that they can crawl on their own to the pouch highlights the species’ incredible developmental capacity,” he says. “Only 10 days earlier, they were just a zygote made up of a few cells.”\n\nJournal reference: Royal Society Open Science DOI: 10.1098/rsos.251970",

Muestra que después de solo 14 días en el útero, los bebés pueden moverse y encontrar la teta de su madre para alimentarse. Este descubrimiento es importante porque los dunnarts de cola gorda están relacionados con el tigre de Tasmania extinto, y estudiarlos podría ayudar en proyectos futuros de conservación o resurrección.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los investigadores seguirán estudiando a los dunnarts para aprender más sobre su desarrollo temprano y cómo sobreviven. También planean usar este conocimiento para apoyar la protección de marsupiales raros y posiblemente ayudar a traer de vuelta especies similares al tigre de Tasmania mediante la edición genética.\n\n**Resumen en una frase** – Por primera vez, científicos han grabado a diminutos marsupiales recién nacidos arrastrándose hacia la bolsa de su madre, revelando nuevos detalles sobre su vida y supervivencia temprana.\n",

Sign up to receive it in your inbox every month.\n\nWhen writing headlines for stories about human evolution, the favourite superlatives are “oldest”, “earliest” and “first”. I have lost count of the number of articles I’ve written that used these.\n\nAnd it’s not just about attracting more readers – even though it usually works that way. If a researcher can find evidence that a species or behaviour is older than previously thought, that is useful information. Figuring out the order in which things happened is crucial to understanding why they happened.\n\nFor instance, we used to think that all rock art was created within the last 40,000 years. That meant it had to have been created by our species (Homo sapiens), as other groups like the Neanderthals had died out by then. But it turns out that some prehistoric art is older than that, so it’s possible Neanderthals were artists too.\n\nIn the past month we’ve had a lot of “earliest” and “first” findings, and they got me thinking about how to interpret these things. When can we be confident that we have figured out how long something really existed for?\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Our Human Story Each month, Michael Marshall unearths the latest news and ideas about ancient humans, evolution, archaeology and more. Sign up to newsletter\n\nFirst!\n\nLet’s start with a story I wrote, if only to get it out of the way. At a dig in southern Greece, archaeologists uncovered two wooden objects that appear to be tools: one seems to be a digging stick, the other’s specific use is difficult to identify. Both are about 430,000 years old, making them the oldest known wooden tools.\n\nThey aren’t that much older than the previous record-holders. The Clacton Spear found in the UK is thought to be 400,000 years old, though it was excavated many decades ago so the dating is necessarily uncertain. A set of wooden spears from Schöningen, Germany, were thought to be of a similar age, but their age has been revised downwards: some methods put them closer to 300,000 years old and a study from May 2025 indicated they were just 200,000 years old.\n\nBone tools also crop up in Europe around this period. At Boxgrove in the UK, researchers found a chunk of bone from an elephant-like animal, perhaps a steppe mammoth. It had been formed into a hammer for reshaping stone tools. The elephant bone is 480,000 years old, making it the earliest known use of elephant bone in Europe. However, elsewhere bone tools were in use much earlier. In east Africa, ancient humans were systematically making tools from bone, including elephant bone, 1.5 million years ago. The practice may date back even earlier, of course.\n\nLet’s come forward in time a bit. At Xigou in central China, archaeologists have just documented a trove of 2601 stone artefacts, dating to between 160,000 and 72,000 years ago. The artefacts included hafted tools: that is, stone tools that were fitted onto something else, such as a wooden pole. This, the researchers say, is “the earliest evidence for composite tools in Eastern Asia, to our knowledge”.\n\nAnd finally, in early January we learned that people in South Africa were hunting with poison arrows 60,000 years ago. Archaeologists found five arrowheads made of quartzite, which were coated with a sticky, poisonous liquid, probably from a plant.\n\nEach of these finds has more to it than meets the eye.\n\nEver further back\n\nTraces of plant toxins were found on these arrow points Marlize Lombard\n\nThe oldest known wooden tools are almost certainly not the actual oldest wooden tools. The issue here is preservation: wood rots, so our record of prehistoric wooden artefacts is pretty scanty.\n\nWhen I spoke to Katerina Harvati, who led the excavation of the wooden tools, she was very clear that people were using wooden tools long before 400,000 years ago. It’s just that we haven’t been able to find them.\n\nIn fact, given that wood is easier to work than stone, and that chimpanzees sometimes make simple wooden tools, it may be that wooden tools are the oldest form of technology. If next week a paper arrives claiming to have found wooden tools from a million years ago, it will be a significant discovery, but – other than the fact of their preservation – it won’t be remotely surprising.\n\nIt follows that we should not hang any major narratives about human technological development on the age of the oldest wooden tools. We would need to systematically investigate sites where such tools could be preserved, at a range of ages, before we could be remotely confident about when people started using them.\n\nLet’s now reconsider those poison arrows. What they are is the oldest known examples of arrowheads with poison on them. However, the story points out that arrowheads with a design consistent with modern-day poison arrows can be found tens of thousands of years earlier. Furthermore, like wood, poisons are prone to biodegrade.\n\nThis is something where I think we can be a bit more confident. Poison arrows are another form of composite technology – putting two or more items together – and that seems to only arise in the later stages of human evolution. It’s not something we see any evidence of early hominins like Ardipithecus or Australopithecus making – whereas I wouldn’t bet against them making simple tools out of wood or bone. We should not wed ourselves to 60,000 years ago as the origin of poison arrows, but our error margin is probably narrower.\n\nAnd then there’s the question of the oldest art, which is an absolute horror show.\n\nPrehistoric graffiti\n\nHand stencils from a cave in Sulawesi, Indonesia Ahdi Agus Oktaviana\n\nThe most famous ancient artworks are cave paintings, though there are also sculptures, engravings and much more. The trouble with a lot of this is that it’s really hard to date.\n\nIf you find a sculpture buried in sediments, it’s often possible to date the sediments. But cave paintings are much trickier. If they were made using charcoal, you may be able to use carbon dating, but only if they were made in the last 50,000 years: any older than that and carbon dating is useless. Most cave art has never been dated, and often can’t be dated given current technologies.\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, we learned that a hand stencil painted on a cave wall in Sulawesi in Indonesia was at least 67,800 years old. This makes it the oldest known rock art anywhere in the world, edging out a similar hand stencil at a cave in northern Spain, which has been attributed to Neanderthals.\n\nDid you see the crucial caveat? It was the words “at least”. The way these artworks have been dated is by sampling thin layers of rock that have formed on top of them, due to water trickling over the rock surface and depositing minerals. These “flowstones” can be dated, but that just gives you a minimum age. The underlying artwork could be much older.\n\nMy point in going through all of this is not to say that we don’t know anything: on the contrary, we have a lot of information, much of which wasn’t available just 10 or 20 years ago. Instead, I want to think through how we might achieve a reliable timeline for human evolution and cultural development, and which bits are seemingly doomed to uncertainty.\n\nIn the fossil record, volume is helpful. Most palaeontologists don’t study large and charismatic animals like dinosaurs, but small things like marine molluscs. The reason is that these organisms are fossilised in huge numbers, which means it’s possible to trace evolutionary changes in a lot of detail. If a species is common in the fossil record and then suddenly disappears after 66 million years ago, that’s good evidence that the species really did go extinct at that point.\n\nIn the human fossil and archaeological record, what things do we have lots of, and what things are scarce?\n\nThere are many hominin species for which we only have a handful of specimens, especially the early ones. That means we have basically no information about how long they existed, or how widespread they were. We also can’t determine if one species evolved directly into another, or if some more complicated process occurred.\n\nIn contrast, our record of stone tools is pretty extensive. It has been inching further back in time: the current oldest known stone tools are the Lomekwian tools from Kenya, dating to 3.3 million years ago. I would not be surprised if older ones turned up. However, really early hominins like Orrorin (6 to 4.5 million years ago, maybe) and Ardipithecus (5.8 to 4.4 million years ago, ish) seem to have spent a lot of time in trees, so I actually would be surprised if they were making stone tools.\n\nWooden tools are another matter. Our sample size is small and spotty, and that’s down to limits to preservation. I don’t expect to have a reliable timeline of the development of wooden tools in my lifetime.\n\nAs for art, our main limit is technological. We have no shortage of preserved art: the problem is inventing ways to reliably date it. At the moment, we can’t draw a timeline of the development of art, and I am suspicious of any attempt to fit it into a wider narrative. But that could change as more art is dated and new techniques are devised. By the time I retire, I expect to have a much better grasp of how ancient humans’ artistic practices changed.\n\nIn some sense, all our stories about human evolution are provisional. That’s true of all palaeontology, of course, but some stories are more provisional than others. There isn’t much wiggle room about the end-Cretaceous extinction that took out the non-bird dinosaurs. But there is still a lot of wiggle room in the human story. Some of that can be closed by digging up more artefacts and creating better dating techniques, and some of it we might just have to live with.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – Scientists study ancient tools and art to learn about early humans. Dating these objects is hard because some materials, like wood and poison, do not last well, and cave paintings are difficult to date precisely.\n\n**What happened** – Archaeologists found wooden tools in Greece that are about 430,000 years old, the oldest known so far. In China, they uncovered over 2,600 stone tools from 160,000 to 72,000 years ago, including some attached to handles. In South Africa, arrowheads coated with poison from 60,000 years ago were discovered. Also, a 67,800-year-old hand stencil was found in an Indonesian cave, making it the oldest known rock art.\n\n**Impact** – These finds show humans used complex tools and created art much earlier than once thought. For example, poison arrows reveal advanced hunting methods long ago. The discoveries also suggest that Neanderthals might have made art, not just modern humans. However, wooden tools are likely older than the oldest found because wood decays easily, so many tools have been lost over time.\n\n**What's next step** – Researchers will keep searching for more tools and art and work on better ways to date them. New methods could help build a clearer timeline of how and when humans developed technology and art. Understanding these changes helps explain how early humans lived and evolved.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – Recent finds of ancient tools and art are changing what we know about early human skills and creativity, showing a richer and older history than previously believed.",
