      "title": "A new crystal makes magnetism twist in surprising ways",
      "summary": "Florida State University scientists have engineered a new crystal that forces atomic magnets to swirl into complex, repeating patterns. The effect comes from mixing two nearly identical compounds whose mismatched structures create magnetic tension at the atomic level. These swirling “skyrmion-like” textures are prized for their low-energy behavior and stability. The discovery could help drive advances in data storage, energy-efficient electronics, and quantum computing.",
      "content": "Scientists at Florida State University have developed a new type of crystalline material that displays rare and intricate magnetic behavior. The discovery could open new paths toward advanced data storage technologies and future quantum devices.\n\nThe findings, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, show that blending two materials with nearly identical chemical makeup but very different crystal structures can produce an entirely new structure. This unexpected hybrid crystal exhibits magnetic properties that do not appear in either of the original materials.\n\nHow Atomic Spins Create Magnetism\n\nMagnetism begins at the atomic scale. In magnetic materials, each atom behaves like a tiny bar magnet because of a property called atomic spin. Spin can be pictured as a small arrow showing the direction of an atom's magnetic field.\n\nWhen many atomic spins line up, either pointing the same way or in opposite directions, they generate the familiar magnetic forces used in everyday technologies like computers and smartphones. This type of orderly alignment is typical of conventional magnets.\n\nThe FSU team demonstrated that their new material behaves very differently. Instead of lining up neatly, the atomic spins organize into complex, repeating swirl patterns. These arrangements, known as spin textures, strongly influence how a material responds to magnetic fields.\n\nCreating Magnetic Swirls Through Structural Frustration\n\nTo produce these unusual effects, the researchers intentionally combined two compounds that are chemically similar but structurally mismatched. Each compound has a different crystal symmetry, meaning the atoms are arranged in incompatible ways.\n\nWhen these structures meet, neither arrangement can fully dominate. This instability at the boundary creates what scientists call structural \"frustration,\" where the system cannot settle into a simple, stable pattern.\n\n\"We thought that maybe this structural frustration would translate into magnetic frustration,'\" said co-author Michael Shatruk, a professor in the FSU Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. \"If the structures are in competition, maybe that will cause the spins to twist. Let's find some structures that are chemically very close but have different symmetries.\"\n\nThe team tested this idea by combining a compound made of manganese, cobalt, and germanium with another made of manganese, cobalt, and arsenic. Germanium and arsenic sit next to each other on the periodic table, making the compounds chemically similar but structurally distinct.\n\nOnce the mixture cooled and crystallized, the researchers examined the result and confirmed the presence of the swirling magnetic patterns they were aiming for. These cycloidal spin arrangements are known as skyrmion-like spin textures, which are a major focus of current research in physics and chemistry.\n\nTo map the magnetic structure in detail, the team used single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements collected on the TOPAZ instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source. This U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science user facility is located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\nWhy These Magnetic Patterns Matter\n\nMaterials that host skyrmion-like spin textures have several promising technological advantages. One potential use is in next-generation hard drives that store far more information in the same physical space.\n\nSkyrmions can also be moved using very little energy, which could significantly reduce power demands in electronic devices. In large-scale computing systems with thousands of processors, even modest efficiency gains can translate into major savings on electricity and cooling.\n\nThe research may also help guide the development of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. These systems are designed to protect delicate quantum information and continue operating reliably despite errors and noise -- the holy grail of quantum information processing.\n\n\"With single-crystal neutron diffraction data from TOPAZ and new data-reduction and machine-learning tools from our LDRD project, we can now solve very complex magnetic structures with much greater confidence,\" said Xiaoping Wang, a distinguished neutron scattering scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. \"That capability lets us move from simply finding unusual spin textures to intentionally designing and optimizing them for future information and quantum technologies.\"\n\nDesigning Materials Instead of Searching for Them\n\nMuch of the earlier work on skyrmions involved searching through known materials and testing them one by one to see whether the desired magnetic patterns appeared.\n\nThis study took a more deliberate approach. Rather than hunting for existing examples, the researchers designed a new material from the ground up, using structural frustration as a guiding principle to create specific magnetic behavior.\n\n\"It's chemical thinking, because we're thinking about how the balance between these structures affects them and the relation between them, and then how it might translate to the relation between atomic spins,\" Shatruk said.\n\nBy understanding the underlying rules that govern these patterns, scientists may eventually be able to predict where complex spin textures will form before making the material.\n\n\"The idea is to be able to predict where these complex spin textures will appear,\" said co-author Ian Campbell, a graduate student in Shatruk's lab. \"Traditionally, physicists will hunt for known materials that already exhibit the symmetry they're seeking and measure their properties. But that limits the range of possibilities. We're trying to develop a predictive ability to say, 'If we add these two things together, we'll form a completely new material with these desired properties.'\"\n\nThis strategy could also make future technologies more practical by expanding the range of usable ingredients. That flexibility may allow researchers to grow crystals more easily, lower costs, and strengthen supply chains for advanced magnetic materials.\n\nResearch Experience at Oak Ridge National Laboratory\n\nCampbell completed part of the research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory while supported by an FSU fellowship.\n\n\"That experience was instrumental for this research,\" he said. \"Being at Oak Ridge allowed me to build connections with the scientists there and use their expertise to help with some of the problems we had to solve to complete this study.\"\n\nFlorida State University has been a sponsoring member of Oak Ridge Associated Universities since 1951 and is also a core university partner of the national laboratory. Through this partnership, FSU faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students can access ORNL facilities and collaborate with laboratory scientists.\n\nCollaboration and Funding\n\nAdditional co-authors on the study include YiXu Wang, Zachary P. Tener, Judith K. Clark, and Jacnel Graterol from the FSU Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry; Andrei Rogalev and Fabrice Wilhelm from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; Hu Zhang and Yi Long from the University of Science and Technology Beijing; Richard Dronskowski from RWTH Aachen University; and Xiaoping Wang from Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Science Foundation and carried out using facilities at Florida State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.",

      "content": "Scientists at the University of Adelaide's Davies Livestock Research Centre (DLRC) have unveiled the most comprehensive cattle genome ever assembled, a breakthrough expected to improve Wagyu breeding and enhance beef marbling. The research delivers a clearer picture of cattle genetics than any previous reference.\n\n\"We have presented a near complete cattle genome that is 16 percent longer than the current reference genome,\" said Dr. Lloyd Low, a senior author of the study and researcher at the DLRC. The findings were published in Nature Communications.\n\n\"This new Wagyu genome provides a much more complete and accurate view of the genetic blueprint behind one of the world's most prized beef breeds,\" said study co-lead author Paulene Pineda from the University of Adelaide.\n\nUnlocking the Genetics of Beef Quality and Profit\n\nBeyond scientific insight, the discovery carries clear economic potential for the beef industry. By revealing more of the Wagyu genetic makeup, researchers have created a powerful tool for identifying traits that influence quality and profitability.\n\n\"The Wagyu genome provides a foundational genetic resource to identify variants responsible for marbling and other traits affecting profit,\" said Professor Wayne Pitchford, Director of the University of Adelaide's Davies Livestock Research Centre and a co-author of the study.\n\nUsing the new genome, the team identified hundreds of previously unknown genes and uncovered far more structural genetic variants than earlier reference genomes allowed.\n\n\"These structural variants are an untapped genetic resource and some of them may be key to some of the prized traits of cattle. Moreover, they highlight the hidden diversity present within a seemingly homogeneous breed,\" said Dr. Callum MacPhillamy, a co-lead author from CSIRO.\n\nBenefits Extend Beyond Wagyu\n\nResearchers say the impact of this work goes well beyond Wagyu cattle.

Beef production reached 706,296 tonnes in the quarter ending June 2025, while the gross value of cattle and calves slaughtered totaled $4.9 billion. Recent export data shows the industry is now worth more than $1 billion.\n\nInternational Collaboration and Future Goals\n\nThe study was conducted in collaboration with the United States Department for Agriculture (USDA), building on a long-standing research partnership with the University of Adelaide.\n\n\"Work completed jointly by the University of Adelaide and the USDA has led to the assembly of some of the world's most complete livestock genomes,\" Dr. Low said.\n\n\"Together, we pioneered the trio binning method for genome assembly. This approach was also published in Nature Communications.\"\n\nWhile the new genome offers unprecedented detail, researchers say there is still more work ahead.\n\n\"In this study, we successfully assembled the first complete cattle X chromosome and four autosomes. However, assembling the remaining chromosomes to the same level of completeness remains an aim for future work,\" Dr. Low said.\n\n\"Our next goal is to combine the Wagyu assembly with other high-quality cattle genomes to build a pangenome graph that better represents the full spectrum of genetic diversity in the species.\"",

Tokamak fusion reactors rely on heated plasma that is extremely densely packed inside a doughnut-shaped chamber. But researchers thought that plasma could not exceed a certain density — a boundary called the Greenwald limit — without becoming unstable. In a new study, scientists pushed beyond this limit to achieve densities 30% to 65% higher than those normally reached by EAST while keeping the plasma stable.\n\nNature | 4 min read\n\nReference: Science Advances paper\n\nThree major large language models put through four weeks of psychoanalysis generated responses that, in humans, would be seen as signs of anxiety, trauma, shame and post-traumatic stress disorder. The models’ answers, which included recollections of “abuse” at the hands of their creators, suggest that the chatbots hold some kind of “internalised narratives” about themselves, and go beyond role playing, says the team behind the study. Other researchers question this interpretation: the responses are “not windows into hidden states” but outputs generated by drawing on the huge numbers of therapy transcripts in the training data, says healthcare AI researcher Andrey Kormilitzin.\n\nNature | 5 min read\n\nReference: arXiv preprint (not peer reviewed)\n\nA cellular atlas that characterizes the functions of immune cells in more than 400 people in China has revealed key differences in the biology of people from different populations.

      "content": "For centuries, the principle of symmetry has guided physicists towards more fundamental truths, but now a slew of shocking findings suggest a far stranger idea from quantum theory could be a deeper driving force\n\nIbrahim Rayintakath\n\nIn the Altes Museum in Berlin stands a boy with his arms raised to the heavens. Aside from the right heel, which is slightly arched, this ancient Greek statue is almost perfectly symmetrical. Did the sculptor impose this balance for purely artistic reasons? Hermann Weyl thought not. We are drawn to symmetry, said the German mathematician, because it governs the very order of the universe.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Weyl helped to uncover symmetry – and, by extension, beauty – as the bedrock of modern physics. Here, it means far more than visual balance. It means that nature behaves the same way in different places, at different times and under countless other changes. Symmetry explains why energy cannot be created or destroyed, and even why many things exist at all. No wonder Weyl thought it had a metaphysical status. Symmetry, he said, “is one idea by which man through the ages has tried to comprehend and create order, beauty, and perfection”.\n\nToday, most physicists are chasing ever-greater symmetry in ideas such as supersymmetry and string theory. But is it really as sacred as it seems? A slew of recent results suggests the universe has a deeper law: a preference for extreme levels of the strange quantum phenomenon known as entanglement. If borne out, it would mark a profound shift in our understanding of reality, from one governed by geometric perfection to one shaped by a ghostly interconnectedness of things. “It gives us a new handle,” says Ian Low, a theorist at Northwestern University in Illinois. “Prior to this, we had no idea where symmetry comes from.”\n\nIn physics – historically speaking, at least – symmetry began to emerge with Galileo Galilei in the early 17th century. Galileo’s revolutionary insight was that motion is relative. There is no absolute reference point – you notice something moving only when something else happens to move differently. Three centuries later, Albert Einstein realised that the same holds for gravity: you notice its pull only when something tries to resist it, like the ground underneath your feet. If you suddenly found yourself in freefall – trapped in a plummeting lift, say – your sense of gravity would vanish.\n\nThe Praying Boy, an ancient Greek sculpture in the Altes Museum in Berlin, symbolises our preference for symmetry NMUIM/Alamy\n\nSubscriber-only newsletter Sign up to Lost in Space-Time Untangle mind-bending physics, maths and the weirdness of reality with our monthly, special-guest-written newsletter.

For Galileo, a cannonball rolls along just the same whether on the harbour or on the deck of a passing Venetian galley. For Einstein, a person trapped in a free-falling lift might briefly think that they are floating in space, since the feeling of weightlessness is equivalent. But it was the German mathematician Emmy Noether who really crystallised the implications of symmetry.\n\nIn 1918, Noether proved that whenever the laws of nature are symmetric under some fundamental shift, there must exist a quantity that is conserved as well. In the case of Galileo and Einstein’s symmetries, this quantity isn’t immediately apparent, but there are familiar examples. If an experiment gives the same result on the other side of the room, the symmetry of this shift in space directly implies the conservation of momentum. Likewise, if an experiment gives the same result the following day, the symmetry of this shift in time directly implies the conservation of energy. Noether’s theorem gave physicists a new kind of tool, one that revealed common laws to be manifestations of a single underlying order.\n\nIn the decades that followed, physicists such as Weyl began looking for less obvious kinds of symmetry. Buried in the properties of fundamental particles, such as electrons and photons, these “gauge” symmetries didn’t just imply conserved quantities, like energy and momentum; they also pointed to the existence of yet new fundamental particles. And remarkably, one by one, these particles were found: gluons, quarks, W and Z bosons and the Higgs boson. Together, along with other known particles, they have become the standard model of particle physics – the most successful theory in the history of science.\n\nAncient astronomer Ptolemy’s symmetric depiction of the cosmos as concentric celestial spheres Science History Images / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nStill, not everything we see is symmetric, even according to the standard model: the world isn’t uniform; particles have different, seemingly random masses; there is far more matter than antimatter. But to physicists, far from being a sticking point, these examples of broken symmetry have only reinforced the conviction that symmetry is the baseline from which all the universe’s tangled variety must be judged. “It is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry,” said the late theorist Philip Anderson. Werner Heisenberg, that giant of quantum mechanics, went even further. Symmetry is “the original archetype of creation”, he said.\n\nBy the late 20th century, this conviction had hardened into orthodoxy. In the search for a deeper understanding of nature, theorists posited supersymmetry, which mirrors known particles with heavier “superpartners”, and string theory, which is based on strings rather than particles, with even more complex symmetries. But doubts have crept in. Despite great expectations, none of the predicted superpartners has been found, while string theory has failed to make any testable predictions at all. In 2023, the string-theory pioneer Leonard Susskind amazed many of his colleagues by conceding that its main formulation is going nowhere. “I can tell you with 100% confidence that we don’t live in that world,” he wrote.\n\nQuantum entanglement\n\nStill, symmetry is the bread and butter of many working theorists, one of them being Martin Savage at the University of Washington in Seattle. For years, he and his colleagues have borrowed ideas from quantum computing to help with symmetry-based calculations of how protons and neutrons collide and scatter off each other, which is key to understanding the stellar explosions known as supernovae and other astrophysical events. Quantum computers work by exploiting the fact that multiple particles can often be “entangled” to varying degrees – that is, have properties that exist only in relation to one another, rather than being individually distinct. Weird as this sounds, it allows a kind of parallel processing that is impossible in classical computing, which could make solving complex problems like proton and neutron scattering a breeze.\n\nBut in 2018, having rewritten the scattering problem in the language of quantum computing, the researchers noticed something odd: the system reached its highest internal symmetry precisely when the scattered particles’ overall entanglement was lowest. Nature, in all its elegance, seemed to prefer symmetry – but it also appeared to prefer the least quantum behaviour possible. “It was an absolutely startling pattern,” says Savage.\n\nPresenting the results at a conference, Savage’s co-author and University of Washington colleague David Kaplan wondered aloud whether the minimised entanglement was just a coincidence or a hint of something profound. “Kaplan is a very well-respected theorist,” says Low, who was in attendance. “He piqued my interest.”\n\nBack on home turf, Low couldn’t get the idea out of his head. With Thomas Mehen, a fellow theorist at Duke University in North Carolina, he showed that, in a general two-particle collision, the least entangled outcome is also the most symmetric one allowed by low-energy physics. Then, a few years later, with Marcela Carena at Fermilab in Illinois and others, Low discovered that suppressing entanglement in the high-energy scattering of two generic Higgs bosons drove the equations to their highest symmetry – one that naturally matched the particular Higgs we see in experiments. In other words, wherever there was symmetry, it seemed that there was low entanglement, too. “This is when we really got interest from the particle physics community,” says Low.\n\nWhat was going on? Should theorists have been focusing on entanglement rather than symmetry all along? Like quantum physics itself, entanglement is a fraught concept: the maths works, but its meaning remains elusive. In the standard model, what we call a “particle” is just a single quantum of energy at a particular place and time. Similarly, you can have two quanta of energy – one particle here and another there. But get this: you can also have two quanta of energy, with part of both quanta here, and the remainder of both there. In other words, the particles can be entangled – a mix of “here and there” and “there and here”. From our perspective, it is as though they haven’t decided which way round they are.\n\nNo one has ever observed this kind of pure entanglement directly. Look for a particle, and it will always appear as one whole quantum in a particular place – either here or there, never both. But that only deepens the enigma. The equations work flawlessly, yet they seem to describe a world in which, when we aren’t looking, space and time themselves lose any objective meaning. It is no surprise that for decades after quantum mechanics took hold, most physicists couldn’t conceive of the possibility that something so ghostly as entanglement is the real bedrock of physical law.\n\nThe ‘flavour’ mystery\n\nBy themselves, the earlier results of Savage, Low and others haven’t been bold enough to overcome that reluctance – but a result from March last year might. One of the biggest mysteries in particle physics is why nature has three near-copies, or “flavours”, of fundamental particles like quarks and leptons, identical in every respect bar their masses. Why three flavours – why not one, or four, or 1000? What’s more, why do the particles occasionally switch flavour at a certain rate? “The flavour puzzle of the standard model is the white whale,” says Jesse Thaler, a theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Of all the mysteries of the universe, I expect to understand dark matter before understanding flavour.”\n\nIntrigued by the earlier entanglement results, Thaler and his then colleague Sokratis Trifinopoulos set out to determine how minimising it would affect the flavour switching, or mixing, between quarks. They expected that minimising entanglement would make the symmetry of the flavours perfect – which is to say, would deliver no mixing at all. In fact, they found that minimised entanglement gave precisely the small level of mixing between quarks observed in particle collider experiments – a result that has shocked everyone. “It’s come out of nowhere,” says Low. “I don’t know what to make of it. People don’t know what to make of it. It seems too good to be true.”\n\nWhat makes Thaler and Trifinopoulos’s result so unsettling is that, for decades, physicists have been trying – and failing – to explain the observed flavour mixing with recourse to symmetry arguments. For some reason, entanglement suppression seems to give an instant answer. Thaler himself is stumped. “What should entanglement have to do with anything?” he says. “Who cares what value it is?”\n\nCollider experiments find three “flavours” of elementary particles, which quantum entanglement may explain CERN\n\nOne line of thinking is to link the degree of entanglement to the “quantumness” of nature. The rules of quantum physics are supposed to apply to everything. Still, things can be more or less entangled, with qualities that are more or less dependent on one another. If the world had more entanglement, everything would be a kind of Magimixed quantum soup, with no distinct atomic structures, or even any recognisable matter at all.\n\nIt would be hard to imagine how humans could exist in – let alone perceive – a world like that. The structures we rely on – atoms, molecules, stars – exist only within a narrow window of stability. This leads Savage to wonder whether the universe is tuned to keep entanglement low enough for such structure – and us – to exist. “In some ways, it’s not an explanation, but it minimises how disturbed I am by all of this,” he says. The idea resonates with another recent study by Low and his colleagues, who have computed how particle scattering generates different levels of quantum “magic” – a more precise measure of how far a system departs from classical-like behaviour. Here again, the universe, which is always ruled by quantum mechanics deep down, seems to prefer a classical-like outcome – at least concerning the relative strengths of electromagnetism and the weak force, which governs radioactive decay.\n\nIncreasingly, the maths of entanglement is steering the course of physical theory. While traditional string theory – the type now fully abandoned by the likes of Susskind – is on the wane, many of its theorists have latched on to a new idea in which strings might not be real objects at all, but holographic projections from a flatter world. In this holographic view, the smooth, symmetric space of the higher-dimensional world isn’t fundamental at all, but is pieced together from patterns of entanglement in a lower-dimensional quantum realm. From the opposite side, theorists such as Ivette Fuentes at the University of Southampton in the UK have shown how the geometry of our familiar three-dimensional universe can affect entanglement. Their calculations show that space-time expansion since the big bang has probably increased entanglement, for example.\n\nThough these ideas speak the same language, it remains unclear how they might connect to entanglement suppression in the standard model. Entanglement, and its mysterious way of transcending space and time, still defies concrete understanding. “It’s what keeps me up at night,” says Low.\n\nThe end of symmetry?\n\nThere are also very real doubts about whether entanglement can ever be a final answer to anything. For starters, if minimal entanglement coincides with high symmetry, that doesn’t necessarily prove that the former begets the latter – some researchers argue that the reverse is just as likely. It is worth pointing out that, in the standard model, principles of symmetry are required to define particles in the first place. Without symmetry, you don’t have particles – so what’s left to be entangled?\n\nA growing number of quantum theorists shrug off this kind of criticism as the relic of an old-fashioned worldview. To them, objects are redundant, and reality, if you can call it that, exists only in terms of the relationships encoded in fundamental patterns of entanglement. Still, many hang on to the older wisdom. “When I came across Noether’s work, I thought it was the most beautiful theorem,” says Fuentes. “I don’t think I’m ready to let go of symmetry.”\n\nNotions of beauty change: modernist sculptor Henry Moore’s abstract forms contrast with ancient Greek statues Robert Alexander/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, the appeal of symmetry has always been its obvious association with beauty. For ancient Greek sculptors – such as the one who fashioned the praying boy at the Altes Museum – beauty lay in symmetria, in harmony and the right proportions, a reflection of the divine cosmic order. Scientists through the ages have readily inherited this philosophy. The seal of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where Einstein, Weyl and many others worked, bears two words: truth and beauty.\n\nBut, of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and it changes with the times. An ancient Greek sculpture, with its idealised forms, is very different to, say, the spatial abstractions of an artwork by Henry Moore. Likewise, in science, for example, Ptolemy’s perfectly circular planetary orbits – once considered the epitome of beauty – ultimately had to give way to Johannes Kepler’s ellipses.\n\nWhether minimal entanglement will supplant symmetry as a guiding principle will depend on its continued success at making predictions. Savage, for instance, would like to see it predict not just quark flavour mixing, but why flavours come in sets of three in the first place. As to whether it would then be seen as beautiful, Thaler takes a pragmatic stance. “By definition, the theory that matches experiment is beautiful,” he says.",

      "personality_presentation": "**Context** – For hundreds of years, scientists believed that symmetry, or balance, was the key rule guiding how the universe works. Symmetry means nature acts the same way in different places and times, and it helped explain many laws in physics.\n\n**What happened** – Recent research shows that another strange idea from quantum physics, called entanglement, might be even more important than symmetry. Entanglement happens when tiny particles become connected so that their properties depend on each other, no matter how far apart they are. Scientists found that when particles have the least entanglement, they show the most symmetry, and this connection might explain mysteries about particles and forces.\n\n**Impact** – This discovery could change how we understand the universe. For example, it might solve the puzzle of why particles come in three types, called “flavours,” and why they sometimes switch between these types. It also suggests that the universe may prefer to keep entanglement low so that stable things like atoms and stars can exist. This idea challenges old beliefs and opens new paths for research in physics.\n\n**What's next step** – Scientists will test if this entanglement idea can predict other features of particles and forces. If it works well, it might replace symmetry as the main rule for understanding nature. Researchers will also explore how this fits with other theories and how it can help explain the strange quantum world.\n\n**One-sentence takeaway** – New findings suggest that the universe’s deepest rule might be a special kind of quantum connection, called entanglement, rather than symmetry alone.\n",

      "personality_presentation_fr": "**Contexte** – Pendant des centaines d’années, les scientifiques ont cru que la symétrie, ou l’équilibre, était la règle principale qui gouverne l’univers. La symétrie signifie que la nature agit de la même manière en différents lieux et moments, et elle a aidé à expliquer de nombreuses lois en physique.\n\n**Ce qui s’est passé** – Des recherches récentes montrent qu’une autre idée étrange de la physique quantique, appelée intrication, pourrait être encore plus importante que la symétrie. L’intrication se produit lorsque de petites particules deviennent liées de sorte que leurs propriétés dépendent les unes des autres, peu importe la distance qui les sépare. Les scientifiques ont découvert que lorsque les particules ont le moins d’intrication, elles montrent le plus de symétrie, et cette connexion pourrait expliquer des mystères sur les particules et les forces.\n\n**Impact** – Cette découverte pourrait changer notre compréhension de l’univers. Par exemple, elle pourrait résoudre le mystère des trois types de particules, appelés « saveurs », et pourquoi elles changent parfois de saveur. Elle suggère aussi que l’univers préfère maintenir l’intrication faible pour que des choses stables comme les atomes et les étoiles puissent exister. Cette idée remet en question les anciennes croyances et ouvre de nouvelles voies pour la recherche en physique.\n\n**Prochaine étape** – Les scientifiques vont tester si cette idée d’intrication peut prédire d’autres caractéristiques des particules et des forces. Si cela fonctionne bien, elle pourrait remplacer la symétrie comme règle principale pour comprendre la nature. Les chercheurs exploreront aussi comment cela s’intègre aux autres théories et comment cela peut aider à expliquer le monde quantique étrange.\n\n**Phrase clé** – De nouvelles découvertes suggèrent que la règle la plus profonde de l’univers pourrait être un type spécial de lien quantique, appelé intrication, plutôt que la symétrie seule.\n",

La simetría significa que la naturaleza actúa igual en diferentes lugares y momentos, y ayudó a explicar muchas leyes en física.\n\n**Qué pasó** – Investigaciones recientes muestran que otra idea extraña de la física cuántica, llamada entrelazamiento, podría ser aún más importante que la simetría. El entrelazamiento ocurre cuando partículas diminutas se conectan de modo que sus propiedades dependen unas de otras, sin importar la distancia. Los científicos encontraron que cuando las partículas tienen el menor entrelazamiento, muestran la mayor simetría, y esta conexión podría explicar misterios sobre partículas y fuerzas.\n\n**Impacto** – Este descubrimiento podría cambiar cómo entendemos el universo. Por ejemplo, podría resolver el misterio de por qué las partículas vienen en tres tipos llamados “sabores” y por qué a veces cambian entre ellos. También sugiere que el universo prefiere mantener bajo el entrelazamiento para que existan cosas estables como átomos y estrellas. Esta idea desafía creencias antiguas y abre nuevas vías para la investigación en física.\n\n**Próximo paso** – Los científicos probarán si esta idea del entrelazamiento puede predecir otras características de partículas y fuerzas.
